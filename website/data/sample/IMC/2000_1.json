We aim to show that there exists some $ x \\in [0,1] $ such that $ f(x) = x $.\n\n#### **Key Idea: Use the Supremum Argument**\n\nDefine the set:\n$$\nA = \\{ x \\in [0,1] \\mid f(x) \\ge x \\}\n$$\nLet $ c = \\sup A $. We analyze this value $ c $ to find a fixed point.\n\n- Since $ f $ is monotone increasing, and $ f(x) \\ge x $ for all $ x \\in A $, then for all $ x \\in A $, $ f(x) \\ge x $.\n- Because $ c = \\sup A $, for any $ \\epsilon > 0 $, there exists $ x \\in A $ such that $ c - \\epsilon < x \\le c $.\n- Since $ f $ is increasing, $ f(x) \\ge f(c - \\epsilon) $, and since $ x \\in A $, $ f(x) \\ge x > c - \\epsilon $, so $ f(c - \\epsilon) \\le f(x) \\ge c - \\epsilon $.\n\nNow consider the value $ f(c) $:\n\n- If $ f(c) > c $, then for all $ x \\in (c, f(c)) $, $ f(x) \\ge f(c) > c $, so $ x \\in A $, contradicting $ c = \\sup A $.\n- If $ f(c) < c $, then for all $ x \\in (f(c), c) $, $ f(x) \\le f(c) < x $, so $ x \\notin A $, contradicting that $ c = \\sup A $.\n\nThus, the only possibility is that $ f(c) = c $, and so $ c $ is a fixed point.\n\n#### **Conclusion:**\nFor any monotone increasing function $ f: [0,1] \\to [0,1] $, there exists at least one $ x \\in [0,1] $ such that $ f(x) = x $.

This is analyzed separately for the two cases.\n\n#### Part (a): Monotone Increasing Case\nAssume \\( f \\) is monotone increasing, meaning that for all \\( x_1, x_2 \\in [0,1] \\), if \\( x_1 < x_2 \\), then \\( f(x_1) \\leq f(x_2) \\).\n\n- If \\( f(0) = 0 \\) or \\( f(1) = 1 \\), then \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = 1 \\) is a fixed point, and the result holds.\n- Otherwise, assume \\( f(0) > 0 \\) and \\( f(1) < 1 \\). Define the set \\( S = \\{ x \\in [0,1] \\mid f(x) > x \\} \\).\n  - Since \\( f(0) > 0 \\), \\( 0 \\in S \\), so \\( S \\) is non-empty.\n  - Since \\( f(1) < 1 \\), \\( 1 \\notin S \\), and \\( S \\) is bounded above by 1.\n- Therefore, \\( S \\) has a least upper bound, denoted \\( c = \\sup S \\). Since \\( S \\subseteq [0,1] \\), \\( c \\in [0,1] \\).\n\nNow, consider two cases based on whether \\( c \\in S \\):\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( c \\in S \\)**  \n   Then \\( f(c) > c \\). Let \\( z = f(c) \\). Since \\( f \\) is monotone increasing and \\( z > c \\), \\( f(z) \\geq f(c) = z \\).  \n   - If \\( f(z) > z \\), then \\( z \\in S \\). But \\( z > c \\) and \\( c = \\sup S \\), so \\( z \\) cannot be in \\( S \\) (as \\( c \\) is an upper bound), a contradiction.  \n   - Therefore, \\( f(z) = z \\), and \\( z \\) is a fixed point.\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( c \\notin S \\)**  \n   Then  \n   \\[\n   f(c) \\leq c,\n   \\]\n   since \\( c \\notin S \\).  \n   Because \\( c = \\sup S \\), for any \\( y < c \\), there exists \\( z \\in S \\) such that \\( y that \\( z \\leq c \\) and \\( f(z) > z \\).  \n   Since \\( f \\) is monotone increasing and \\( z \\leq c \\),  \n   \\[\n   f(z) \\leq f(c).\n   \\]\n   Thus, for each such \\( z \\), \\( f(z) > z \\) and \\( f(z) \\leq f(c) \\).  \n   Because \\( f \\) is monotone increasing, the left-hand limit at \\( c \\) exists. Denote  \n   \\[\n   L = \\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x).\n   \\]  \n   Since \\( z \\to c^- \\) (as \\( z \\) can be chosen arbitrarily close to \\( c \\) from below) and \\( f(z) > z \\), it follows that  \n   \\[\n   L \\geq c.\n   \\]  \n   Also, because \\( f \\) is increasing,  \n   \\[\n   L \\leq f(c).\n   \\]  \n   Combining,  \n   \\[\n   c \\leq L \\leq f(c) \\leq c,\n   \\]  \n   so \\( c \\leq f(c) \\leq c \\), implying  \n   \\[\n   f(c) = c.\n   \\]  \n   Thus, \\( c \\) is a fixed point.\n\nIn both cases, a fixed point exists. Therefore, for any monotone increasing function \\( f: [0,1] \\to [0,1] \\), there exists \\( x \\in [0,1] \\) such that \\( f(x) = x \\).\n\n#### Part (b): Monotone Decreasing Case\nFor the monotone decreasing case, it is not necessarily true that a fixed point exists. A counterexample is provided.\n\nDefine \\( f: [0,1] \\to [0,1] \\) by  \n\\[\nf(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq 0.5, \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } 0.5 < x \\leq 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n- \\( f \\) is monotone decreasing:  \n  - If \\( 0 \\leq x_1 < x_2 \\leq 0.5 \\), then \\( f(x_1) = 1 \\) and \\( f(x_2) = 1 \\), so \\( f(x_1) \\geq f(x_2) \\).  \n  - If \\( 0.5 < x_1 < x_2 \\leq 1 \\), then \\( f(x_1) = 0 \\) and \\( f(x_2) = 0 \\), so \\( f(x_1) \\geq f(x_2) \\).  \n  - If \\( 0 \\leq x_1 \\leq 0.5 < x_2 \\leq 1 \\), then \\( f(x_1) = 1 \\) and \\( f(x_2) = 0 \\), so \\( f(x_1) > f(x_2) \\), hence \\( f(x_1) \\geq f(x_2) \\).  \n  Thus, \\( f \\) is monotone decreasing.\n\n- There is no fixed point:  \n  - For \\( x \\in [0, 0.5] \\), \\( f(x) = 1 \\neq x \\) (since \\( x \\leq 0.5 < 1 \\)).  \n  - For \\( x \\in (0.5, 1] \\), \\( f(x) = 0 < x \\) (since \\( x > 0.5 > 0 \\)), so \\( f(x) \\neq x \\).  \n  Thus, \\( f(x) \\neq x \\) for all \\( x \\in [0,1] \\).\n\nThis counterexample shows that for a monotone decreasing function, a fixed point may not exist.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- For part (a), if \\( ( f \\) is monotone increasing, there always exists a fixed point.  \n- For part (b), if \\( f \\) is monotone decreasing, there may not exist a fixed point, as demonstrated by the counterexample.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{For part (a), yes; for part (b), not necessarily.}}",

If f(0) = 0 or f(1) = 1, we're done. So assume f(0) > 0 and f(1) < 1. Since f maps to [0,1], f(0) \u2265 0, but if f(0) = 0, fixed point. Similarly for f(1). So assume f(0) > 0 and f(1) < 1.\n\nNow, consider the function g(x) = f(x) - x. If I can show g has a zero, that's the fixed point. g(0) = f(0) - 0 = f(0) > 0. g(1) = f(1) - 1 < 0 since f(1) < 1. If g were continuous, by IVT, there's x with g(x)=0. But g may not be continuous since f may not be.\n\nf is monotone increasing, so g might have discontinuities. But since f is monotone, it can only have jump discontinuities. I should consider the supremum or infimum of certain sets.\n\nLet S = {x in [0,1] | f(x) > x}. Since f(0) > 0, 0 is in S. Also, f(1) < 1, so 1 is not in S. S is non-empty and bounded above by 1.\n\nSince S is bounded above, it has a least upper bound, say sup S = c.\n\nc is in [0,1]. Now, I need to show that f(c) = c.\n\nBecause f is monotone increasing, and c is sup S, I need to see the behavior around c.\n\nConsider cases based on whether c is in S or not.\n\nCase 1: c in S. Then f(c) > c. Since f is monotone increasing, for x > c, since x not in S (because c is sup S, so for x > c, f(x) \u2264 x). S is {x | f(x) > x}, so for x > c, x not in S, so f(x) \u2264 x.\n\nBut f(c) > c. Since f is monotone increasing, for x > c, f(x) \u2265 f(c) > c. But also f(x) \u2264 x, so c < f(x) \u2264 x.\n\nSince f(x) \u2264 x and f(x) > c, so c < f(x) \u2264 x.\n\nAs x approaches c from above, x - c becomes small, but f(x) is at least f(c) > c, and less than or equal to x.\n\nI need to show a contradiction or something.\n\nAssume f(c) > c. Since f is monotone increasing, and maps to [0,1], let's consider f(f(c)).\n\nf(c) > c, and f is increasing, so f(f(c)) \u2265 f(c) > c.\n\nBut f(f(c)) is defined since f(c) in [0,1].\n\nNow, f(c) > c, so f(c) is in S, but c is sup S, and f(c) > c, which contradicts that c is an upper bound for S.\n\nS = {x | f(x) > x}, and c = sup S.\n\nIf c in S, then f(c) > c, so f(c) is greater than c, and since f(c) in [0,1], f(c) is in S. But f(c) > c, and c is sup S, meaning c is an upper bound, so no element in S can be larger than c. But f(c) > c and in S, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, c cannot be in S.\n\nSo c not in S.\n\nTherefore, since c not in S, f(c) \u2264 c.\n\nNow, I need to show f(c) \u2265 c.\n\nc = sup S, and c not in S, so f(c) \u2264 c.\n\nNow, consider points less than c.\n\nSince c is sup S, for any y < c, there exists some z in S with y < z \u2264 c. Because c is least upper bound.\n\nS contains points arbitrarily close to c from below.\n\nFor any y < c, there is z with y < z \u2264 c and z in S, so f(z) > z.\n\nSince f is monotone increasing, and z \u2264 c, f(z) \u2264 f(c).\n\nBut f(z) > z.\n\nSo for any such z, f(z) > z and f(z) \u2264 f(c).\n\nAs z approaches c from below, since z can be arbitrarily close to c, and f(z) > z, so lim sup as x->c- of f(x) should be at least c, but because f is monotone, the left-hand limit exists.\n\nf is monotone increasing, so left-hand limit at c exists. Let L = lim_{x->c-} f(x).\n\nSince for z < c and z in S, f(z) > z, and z can be close to c, so L \u2265 c.\n\nBecause f(z) > z for z near c, z < c, so as z->c-, f(z) > z, and z->c, so lim f(z) \u2265 c, so L \u2265 c.\n\nBut since f is monotone increasing, L \u2264 f(c).\n\nAlso, since f(c) \u2264 c from earlier.\n\nWe have L \u2264 f(c) \u2264 c.\n\nBut L \u2265 c, so L \u2265 c and L \u2264 f(c) \u2264 c, so L \u2265 c and L \u2264 c, so L = c.\n\nAlso, f(c) \u2264 c and L \u2264 f(c), and L = c, so c \u2264 f(c) \u2264 c, thus f(c) = c.\n\nIs that right?\n\nL = c, and L \u2264 f(c) \u2264 c, so c \u2264 f(c) \u2264 c, so f(c) = c.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, what about the case where f is continuous? But I didn't assume continuity.\n\nIn this case, for monotone increasing, it seems to work.\n\nBut let me check if f(c) is defined and all.\n\nc in [0,1], f defined.\n\nAlso, at c, we have f(c) = c.\n\nIn the argument, I used that f is monotone increasing to have left-hand limit.\n\nAnd that L = c and L \u2264 f(c) \u2264 c, so equality.\n\nNow, what if c=0? If c=0, sup S=0.\n\nSince 0 in S, f(0)>0, but sup S={0}, and 0 in S, which we saw leads to contradiction, but in this case, if sup S=0, that means S={0} or something.\n\nIf sup S=0, since S is non-empty (0 in S), and sup S=0, then S must be {0}, because if there were x<0, but [0,1], so only x=0.\n\nSo S={0}, so f(0)>0.\n\nBut sup S=0, and f(0)>0, now f(0) in S? S is {x | f(x)>x}, f(0)>0, so 0 in S, but f(0) is a point, f(0) is not x, it's f(x).\n\nS is a set of x values.\n\nf(0) is a number, which may or may not be in [0,1].\n\nIn this case, c=0, sup S=0.\n\nc=0 not in S? Earlier I concluded c not in S, but if S={0}, then c=0 is in S.\n\nBut we had a contradiction if c in S.\n\nIn the beginning, if f(0)>0, then 0 in S.\n\nIf sup S=0, then c=0, and 0 in S, so f(0)>0.\n\nNow, f(0) is some number, say a>0.\n\nNow, is a in S? S={x | f(x)>x}, so we need to see if f(a)>a.\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nBut in the contradiction step, I said if c in S, then f(c)>c, and f(c)>c, so f(c) in S, but f(c)>c, contradiction since c sup.\n\nBut here c=0, f(c)=f(0)=a>0=c.\n\nNow, f(c)=a, and a>0, now is a in S? That is, is f(a)>a?\n\nNot necessarily, so it might not be in S, so no contradiction.\n\nAh, problem.\n\nFor example, suppose f(0)=0.5, and f(x)=0 for x>0.\n\nBut f is monotone increasing? f(0)=0.5, and for x>0, f(x)=0, but if x small, f(x)=0 < x if x>0, but for x=0.1, f(0.1)=0 < 0.1, so not greater.\n\nBut is this monotone increasing? f(0)=0.5, f(0.1)=0, which is less, so not increasing. So invalid.\n\nMonotone increasing means if x1 < x2, then f(x1) <= f(x2).\n\nSo in this case, for x=0 and x=0.1, 0<0.1 but f(0)=0.5 > 0 = f(0.1), so not increasing.\n\nSo for monotone increasing, it must be that f(0) <= f(x) for x>0.\n\nIn particular, since f(0) >0, and f monotone increasing, f(x) >= f(0) >0 for all x.\n\nIn the case where c=0, sup S=0.\n\nSince sup S=0, and S non-empty only at 0, so for all x>0, x not in S, so f(x) <= x.\n\nAlso, since f monotone increasing, f(x) >= f(0) >0 for all x.\n\nNow, at x=0, f(0) >0.\n\nNow, consider g(x) = f(x) - x.\n\ng(0) = f(0) - 0 >0.\n\ng(0) >0.\n\nFor x>0, f(x) <= x, so g(x) <=0.\n\nAs x approaches 0+, g(x) = f(x) - x <=0, but f(x) >= f(0) >0, so g(x) >= f(0) - x > -x, which goes to 0, but g(x) <=0.\n\nThe left-hand limit at  at 0, but c=0, we need to see f at 0.\n\nc=0, and f(c) = f(0) >0 =c.\n\nBut we need to check if f(0)=0.\n\nIn this case, f(0) >0, so not fixed point.\n\nBut is there a fixed point?\n\nFor example, suppose f(0)=0.5, and f(x)=0.5 for all x in [0,0.5], and for x>0.5, f(x)=x or something.\n\nBut let's define properly.\n\nSuppose f(x) = 0.5 for x in [0,0.5], and f(x) = x for x in (0.5,1].\n\nBut at x=0.5, f(0.5)=0.5 if we define, but let's see.\n\nf(0.5) should be 0.5 if defined that way.\n\nBut for x<0.5, f(x)=0.5 > x if x<0.5.\n\nFor example, x=0.4, f(0.4)=0.5 >0.4, so x in S.\n\nSimilarly, x=0.3, f(0.3)=0.5>0.3, in S.\n\nNow, S = {x in [0,0.5) } since for x in [0,0.5), f(x)=0.5 > x.\n\nAt x=0.5, if f(0.5)=0.5, then f(x)=x, not greater, so not in S.\n\nFor x>0.5, f(x)=x, so f(x)=x, not greater than x, so not in S.\n\nSo S = [0,0.5)\n\nsup S = 0.5\n\nc=0.5\n\nNow, c=0.5 not in S, since f(0.5)=0.5 not greater.\n\nf(c) = f(0.5) = 0.5 = c, fixed point.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nNow, back to c=0 case.\n\nSuppose that sup S=0.\n\nSince sup S=0, and S non-empty, must have 0 in S, so f(0)>0.\n\nAlso, for all x>0, x not in S, so f(x) <= x.\n\nSince f monotone increasing, f(x) >= f(0) >0 for all x.\n\nNow, consider the point x=0.\n\nf(0) >0.\n\nNow, is there a fixed point? Not necessarily at 0.\n\nBut f(x) <= x for x>0, and f(x) >= f(0) >0.\n\nNow, since f(0) >0, and f maps to [0,1], consider y = f(0) >0.\n\nSince y >0, and for x>0, f(x) <= x.\n\nIf f(y) = y, then fixed point.\n\nOtherwise, since y >0, and f(y) <= y, because y>0, not in S, so f(y) <= y.\n\nIf f(y) < y, then since f is monotone, but not sure.\n\nIn the sup S argument, when c=0, we have c=0, f(c)=f(0)>0=c, so f(c)>c.\n\nBut we need to show f(c) >= c, which is true, but f(c) <= c? Not necessarily.\n\nEarlier I had f(c) <= c only if c not in S, but when c=0 in S, we have contradiction? Not always.\n\nIn this case, with sup S=0, c=0 in S, f(0)>0.\n\nNow, f(f(0)) = f(y), where y=f(0)>0.\n\nSince y>0, and sup S=0, y>0 not in S, so f(y) <= y.\n\nAlso, since f monotone increasing, and y = f(0) >0, so for x >= y, f(x) >= f(y) >= f(0) = y? f(x) >= f(0) = y for x >=0, since increasing.\n\nf is increasing, so for x >=0, f(x) >= f(0) = y.\n\nIn particular, for x = y, f(y) >= f(0) = y.\n\nBut from above, f(y) <= y, so f(y) <= y and f(y) >= y, thus f(y) = y.\n\nSo y is a fixed point.\n\nSimilarly, in general, if c in S, then f(c) > c, and f(c) > c, so f(c) is in [0,1], and since f(c) > c, and c = sup S, if f(c) > c, then f(c) not in S? S is {x | f(x) > x}, so for point z = f(c), we need to see if f(z) > z.\n\nBut z = f(c), and f(z) = f(f(c)).\n\nSince f(c) > c, and f is increasing, f(f(c)) >= f(c) > c.\n\nBut f(f(c)) >= f(c), so f(z) >= z, which means that if f(z) > z, then z in S, but z = f(c) > c, and c sup S, so if z > c, it cannot be in S since c is upper bound, contradiction.\n\nIf f(z) = z, then z is fixed point.\n\nIn the case where c in S, we have f(c) > c, let z = f(c) > c.\n\nThen f(z) >= f(c) = z, because f increasing, so f(z) >= z.\n\nNow, if f(z) > z, then z in S, but z > c, and c sup S, so z cannot be in S, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, it must be that f(z) = z, so z is fixed point.\n\nThus, in all cases, we have a fixed point.\n\nFor the increasing case, it seems to work.\n\nNow, let's confirm with the decreasing case.\n\nThe problem is for both increasing and decreasing.\n\nNow, decreasing might be different.\n\nFirst, for increasing, we have a fixed point.\n\nNow, for monotone decreasing.\n\nf: [0,1] -> [0,1] monotone decreasing.\n\nMeaning if x1 < x2, then f(x1) >= f(x2).\n\nNow, I need to see if there is fixed point.\n\nIt might not be true.\n\nFor example, consider f(0) = 1, f(1) = 0! Then at x=0, f(0)=1>0, at x=1, f(1)=0<1.\n\nIf f is continuous, by IVT, fixed point exists.\n\nBut if not continuous?\n\nFor example, suppose f(x) = 1 for x in [0,0.5), and f(x) = 0 for x in [0.5,1].\n\nBut at x=0.5, define f(0.5)=0.5 or something.\n\nSet f(x) = 1 for x in [0,0.5), f(0.5) = 0.5, f(x) = 0 for x in (0.5,1].\n\nBut is this decreasing? For x<0.5, f(x)=1, x=0.5, f=0.5, x>0.5, f=0.\n\nSo if x1 < x2 both less than 0.5, f(x1)=1, f(x2)=1, so f(x1) >= f(x2), ok.\n\nIf x1 < 0.5 < x2, f(x1)=1, f(x2)=0, so f(x1)=1 > 0 = f(x2), so decreasing.\n\nAt x=0.5, f=0.5.\n\nNow, fixed points: at x=0.5, f(0.5)=0.5, fixed point.\n\nNow, another example: suppose no fixed point.\n\nCan I have a decreasing function with no fixed point?\n\nSuppose f(0) = 1, f(1) = 0, and for x in (0,1), f(x) < x or something.\n\nBut f decreasing.\n\nSuppose f(x) = 1 for x <= 0.5, and f(x) = 0 for x > 0.5.\n\nBut at x=0.5, if f(0.5)=1, then for x>0.5, f(x)=0.\n\nNow, is there fixed point? f(0.5)=1 \u2260 0.5, unless 0.5=1, no.\n\nf(0.5)=1, not 0.5.\n\nFor x<0.5, f(x)=1 > x if x<1, but x<0.5<1, so f(x)=1 > x.\n\nFor x>0.5, f(x)=0 < x.\n\nAt x=0.5, f=1 \u22600.5.\n\nNo fixed point.\n\nBut is this monotone decreasing?\n\nFor x1 < x2 both <=0.5, f(x1)=1, f(x2)=1, equal, ok.\n\nIf x1 <=0.5 < x2, f(x1)=1, f(x2)=0, so f(x1) > f(x2), decreasing.\n\nIf both >0.5, f=0, equal.\n\nSo yes, monotone decreasing.\n\nAnd f: [0,1] -> [0,1], f(0)=1, f(1)=0 if we define, but at x=1, if f(1)=0.\n\nIn this case, f(0.5)=1 \u22600.5, and for other points, no equality.\n\nSo no fixed point.\n\nBut the range: f(x) is 1 for x<=0.5, 0 for x>0.5, so it maps to {0,1}, which is in [0,1], ok.\n\nSo for this function, no fixed point.\n\nBut it is monotone decreasing.\n\nTherefore, for decreasing, it may not have a fixed point.\n\nThe question is to prove for both cases, but for decreasing, it's not always true.\n\na) monotone increasing: should be true, as I proved.\n\nb) monotone decreasing: not always true, as counterexample.\n\nIn the counterexample, f is not continuous, but that's allowed.\n\nPerhaps if I assume continuous, it would have, but here not required.\n\nThe problem says \"monotone increasing\" and \"monotone decreasing\", and for decreasing, we have a counterexample.\n\nBut let me confirm the definition.\n\nMonotone increasing: non-decreasing, I assume, meaning if x1 < x2, f(x1) <= f(x2).\n\nSimilarly, monotone decreasing: if x1 < x2, f(x1) >= f(x2).\n\nIn the counterexample, it works.\n\nPerhaps for decreasing, if I require strict, but no, it says monotone, so non-strict.\n\nAnother thing: in the increasing case, I proved it always has fixed point, even if not continuous.\n\nIn decreasing case, not necessarily.\n\nBut in my counterexample, at x=0.5, f=1, but if I define f(0.5)=0.5, then it would have fixed point.\n\nBut I defined f(0.5)=1, no fixed point.\n\nTo make it not have fixed point, I need to avoid the point where it might be fixed.\n\nSuppose f(x) = 1 for x in [0,0.5), f(x) = 0 for x in [0.5,1].\n\nThen for x in [0,0.5), f(x)=1 > x (since x<0.5<1), for x in [0.5,1], f(x)=0 <= x? At x=0.5, f=0 < 0.5? If f(0.5)=0, then 0<0.5, so f(x) <= x for x in [0.5,1], and strictly less except possibly at endpoints, but at x=1, f(1)=0<1.\n\nNo point where f(x)=x.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I set f(0.5)=0.5, then it has fixed point, but I can choose not to.\n\nSo for decreasing, it may not have fixed point.\n\nTherefore, to answer the question:\n\nFor a) monotone increasing, yes, there exists fixed point.\n\nFor b) monotone decreasing, not necessarily, as counterexample shows.\n\nNow, I need to write the proof.\n\nFirst, for part a).\n\nProve that if f: [0,1] -> [0,1] is monotone increasing, then there exists x in [0,1] such that f(x)=x.\n\nProof:\n\nIf f(0) = 0 or f(1) = 1, then x=0 or x=1 is a fixed point, and we are done.\n\nOtherwise, f(0) > 0 and f(1) < 1.\n\nDefine the set S = {x in [0,1] | f(x) > x}.\n\nSince f(0) > 0, we have f(0) > 0, so 0 in S, thus S is non-empty.\n\nAlso, since f(1) < 1, 1 not in S.\n\nMoreover, S is bounded above by 1.\n\nTherefore, S has a least upper bound, denoted c = sup S.\n\nSince S subset [0,1], c in [0,1].\n\nNow, we consider two cases: c in S and c not in S.\n\nFirst, suppose c in S. Then f(c) > c.\n\nSince f is monotone increasing, f(f(c)) >= f(c) > c.\n\nNow, let z = f(c). Then z > c, and f(z) >= z, as above.\n\nIf f(z) > z, then z in S. But z > c and c = sup S, so z cannot be in S, contradiction. Therefore, it must be that f(z) = z, so z is a fixed point.\n\nSecond, suppose c not in S. Then since c not in S, f(c) <= c.\n\nBecause c = sup S, for any y < c, there exists z in S with y < z <= c.\n\nSince z in S, f(z) > z.\n\nAlso, since f is monotone increasing, f(z) <= f(c), because z <= c.\n\nThus, for each such z, f(z) > z and f(z) <= f(c).\n\nAs z approaches c from below, since z <= c and z > y for any y<c, we have that the left-hand limit of f at c exists because f is monotone increasing. Denote L = lim_{x->c-} f(x).\n\nThen L <= f(c), since f is increasing.\n\nAlso, since f(z) > z for z < c, and z -> c, it follows that L >= c.\n\nThus, c <= L <= f(c) <= c.\n\nTherefore, c <= f(c) <= c, so f(c) = c, and c is a fixed point.\n\nIn both cases, we found a fixed point.\n\nNow, for the case where c=0 or c=1, it should be covered.\n\nIf c=0, sup S=0, so S={0}, thus f(0)>0.\n\nThen as above, if c in S, we get a fixed point z=f(0).\n\nSimilarly, if c=1, sup S=1.\n\nc=1, and if 1 in S, then f(1)>1, but f(1)<=1 since range [0,1], contradiction, so c=1 not in S.\n\nThen f(c) <= c, i.e., f(1) <=1.\n\nNow, since c=1 not in S, and for y<1, there z in S with y<z<=1, f(z)>z.\n\nLeft-hand limit L at 1, L <= f(1) <=1, and L >=1 since f(z)>z, z->1-, so L=1, thus f(1)=1.\n\nSimilarly, if f(1)=1, fixed point anyway.\n\nIn the beginning, we assumed not f(1)=1, but if f(1)=1, done.\n\nSo covered.\n\nThus for increasing, always fixed point.\n\nNow for decreasing, we have counterexample.\n\nBut to be thorough.\n\nPart b): Monotone decreasing.\n\nWe claim that it is not necessarily true that there is a fixed point.\n\nCounterexample: Define f: [0,1] -> [0,1] as follows:\n\nf(x) = 1 for x in [0, 0.5]\n\nf(x) = 0 for x in (0.5, 1]\n\nMore precisely, set f(x) = 1 for x in [0, 0.5], and f(x) = 0 for x in (0.5, 1].\n\nThen f is monotone decreasing: if x1 < x2, if both in [0,0.5], f(x1)=1, f(x2)=1, equal.\n\nIf both in (0.5,1], f(x1)=0, f(x2)=0, equal.\n\nIf x1 in [0,0.5], x2 in (0.5,1], then x1 <=0.5 < x2, so f(x1)=1, f(x2)=0, thus f(x1) > f(x2), so decreasing.\n\nNow, for any x in [0,0.5], f(x)=1 \u2260 x unless x=1, but x<=0.5<1.\n\nFor x in (0.5,1], f(x)=0 < x since x>0.5>0, and f(x)=0 not equal to x unless x=0, not in range.\n\nThus no fixed point.\n\nTherefore, for monotone decreasing, it is not always true that there is a fixed point.\n\nSo to summarize.\n",

This means that for any \\(x_1, x_2 \\in [0,1]\\) with \\(x_1 \\le x_2\\), we have \\(f(x_1) \\le f(x_2)\\).\n\nConsider the set \\(S = \\{y \\in [0,1] \\mid y \\le f(y)\\}\\).\n(Alternatively, one could define \\(S = \\{y \\in [0,1] \\mid f(y) \\ge y\\}\\), the argument is very similar.)\n\n1.  **Show that \\(S\\) is non-empty:**\n    Consider \\(y=0\\). Since \\(f: [0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]\\), we know that \\(f(0) \\in [0,1]\\). This implies \\(f(0) \\ge 0\\).\n    Thus, \\(0 \\le f(0)\\), which means \\(0 \\in S\\). So, \\(S\\) is non-empty.\n\n2.  **Show that \\(S\\) has a supremum in \\([0,1]\\):**\n    Since \\(S \\subseteq [0,1]\\), \\(S\\) is bounded above (by 1).\n    By the completeness axiom of the real numbers, a non-empty set that is bounded above must have a supremum. Let \\(x_0 = \\sup S\\).\n    Since \\(0 \\in S\\), \\(x_0 \\ge 0\\). Since \\(S \\subseteq [0,1]\\), \\(x_0 \\le 1\\). Therefore, \\(x_0 \\in [0,1]\\).\n\n3.  **Show that \\(x_0 \\le f(x_0)\\):**\n    Let \\(y\\) be an arbitrary element of \\(S\\). Then \\(y \\le x_0\\).\n    Since \\(f\\) is monotone increasing, \\(f(y) \\le f(x_0)\\).\n    By the definition of \\(S\\), \\(y \\in S\\) implies \\(y \\le f(y)\\).\n    So, for any \\(y \\in S\\), we have \\(y \\le f(y) \\le f(x_0)\\).\n    This means that \\(y \\le f(x_0)\\) for all \\(y \\in S\\).\n    Therefore, \\(f(x_0)\\) is an upper bound for the set \\(S\\).\n    Since \\(x_0\\) is the least upper bound (supremum) of \\(S\\), we must have \\(x_0 \\le f(x_0)\\).\n\n4.  **Show that \\(f(x_0) \\le x_0\\):**\n    From step 3, we have \\(x_0 \\le f(x_0)\\). Let \\(y_0 = f(x_0)\\). So \\(x_0 \\le y_0\\).\n    Since \\(f\\) maps \\([0,1]\\) to \\([0,1]\\), \\(x_0 \\in [0,1]\\) implies \\(y_0 = f(x_0) \\in [0,1]\\).\n    If \\(x_0 = y_0\\), then \\(f(x_0) = x_0\\), and we have found a fixed point.\n    Suppose, for contradiction, that \\(x_0 < y_0\\).\n    Since \\(f\\) is monotone increasing, and \\(x_0 < y_0\\), we have \\(f(x_0) \\le f(y_0)\\).\n    Using \\(y_0 = f(x_0)\\), this inequality becomes \\(y_0 \\le f(y_0)\\).\n    This means that \\(y_0\\) satisfies the condition for being in \\(S\\) (i.e., \\(y_0 \\le f(y_0)\\)).\n    Since \\(y_0 = f(x_0) \\in [0,1]\\), \\(y_0 \\in S\\).\n    However, we assumed \\(x_0 < y_0\\). So we have found an element \\(y_0 \\in S\\) such that \\(y_0 > x_0\\).\n    This contradicts the fact that \\(x_0\\) is the supremum of \\(S\\).\n    Therefore, the assumption \\(x_0 < f(x_0)\\) must be false.\n    This implies that \\(f(x_0) \\le x_0\\). (Note: \\(x_0 < f(x_0)\\) is false means \\(x_0 \\ge f(x_0)\\)).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    From step 3, we have \\(x_0 \\le f(x_0)\\). From step 4, we have \\(f(x_0) \\le x_0\\).\n    Combining these two inequalities, we get \\(f(x_0) = x_0\\).\n    Thus, \\(x_0\\) is a fixed point of \\(f\\).\n\nSo, for part a), the statement is true.\n\n**Part b) \\(f\\) is monotone decreasing**\n\nWe claim that if \\(f:[0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]\\) is monotone decreasing, it is not necessarily true that there exists an \\(x \\in [0,1]\\) such that \\(f(x)=x\\).\n\n**Proof by Counterexample:**\nConsider the function \\(f: [0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]\\) defined as:\n\\\\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } x \\in [0, 1/2) \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x \\in [1/2, 1] \\end{cases} \\\\]\n\n1.  **Verify that \\(f\\) maps \\([0,1]\\) to \\([0,1]\\):**\n    The domain of \\(f\\) is \\([0, 1/2) \\cup [1/2, 1] = [0,1]\\).\n    The values \\(f(x)\\) can take are 0 or 1. Both are in \\([0,1]\\). So \\(f\\) maps \\([0,1]\\) to \\([0,1]\\).\n\n2.  **Verify that \\(f\\) is monotone decreasing:**\n    Let \\(x_1, x_2 \\in [0,1]\\) such that \\(x_1 < x_2\\). We need to show \\(f(x_1) \\ge f(x_2)\\).\n    Case 1: \\(x_1, x_2 \\in [0, 1/2)\\). Then \\(f(x_1) = 1\\) and \\(f(x_2) = 1\\). So \\(f(x_1) \\ge f(x_2)\\) (as \\(1 \\ge 1\\)).\n    Case 2: \\(x_1, x_2 \\in [1/2, 1]\\). Then \\(f(x_1) = 0\\) and \\(f(x_2) = 0\\). So \\(f(x_1) \\ge f(x_2)\\) (as \\(0 \\ge 0\\)).\n    Case 3: \\(x_1 \\in [0, 1/2)\\) and \\(x_2 \\in [1/2, 1]\\). Then \\(f(x_1) = 1\\) and \\(f(x_2) = 0\\). So \\(f(x_1) \\ge f(x_2)\\) (as \\(1 \\ge 0\\)).\n    In all cases, if \\(x_1 < x_2\\), then \\(f(x_1) \\ge f(x_2)\\). So \\(f\\) is monotone decreasing.\n\n3.  **Show that \\(f\\) has no fixed point:**\n    We are looking for an \\(x \\in [0,1]\\) such that \\(f(x)=x\\).\n    Case 1: \\(x \\in [0, 1/2)\\).\n    For these values of \\(x\\), \\(f(x)=1\\). So, if there is a fixed point, it must satisfy \\(x=1\\).\n    However, \\(x \\in [0, 1/2)\\) means \\(x < 1/2\\). So \\(x=1\\) is not in this interval.\n    Thus, there is no fixed point in \\([0, 1/2)\\).\n    Case 2: \\(x \\in [1/2, 1]\\).\n    For these values of \\(x\\), \\(f(x)=0\\). So, if there is a fixed point, it must satisfy \\(x=0\\).\n    However, \\(x \\in [1/2, 1]\\) means \\(x \\ge 1/2\\). So \\(x=0\\) is not in this interval.\n    Thus, there is no fixed point in \\([1/2, 1]\\).\n    Since \\([0,1] = [0,1/2) \\cup [1/2,1]\\), and there is no fixed point in either subinterval, the function \\(f(x)\\) has no fixed point in \\([0,1]\\).\n\nThis counterexample demonstrates that a monotone decreasing function \\(f: [0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]\\) does not necessarily have a fixed point.\nSo, for part b), the statement is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\na) Yes, if \\(f:[0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]\\) is monotone increasing, then there exists an \\(x \\in [0,1]\\) for which \\(f(x) = x\\).\nb) No, it is not true that if \\(f:[0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]\\) is monotone decreasing, then there must exist an \\(x \\in [0,1]\\) for which \\(f(x) = x\\). We have provided a counterexample.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{a) Yes, b) No}$.",

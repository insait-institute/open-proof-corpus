            "thinking": "<think>\nI need to tackle this two-part problem. Both parts involve decreasing sequences of positive numbers. For part a), I need to show that the square root of the sum of squares up to n is less than or equal to the sum of x_i over the square root of i. Part b) is more involved, requiring me to show that a certain infinite sum involving the tail of the sum of squares is bounded by a constant times the sum of the x_i's.\n\nFirst, since the sequence is decreasing and positive, that might be important. For part a), I recall that for decreasing sequences, there might be some inequalities involving sums and squares.\n\nI am considering the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality because it often deals with sums of products and squares. Cauchy-Schwarz in the context of sums says that for sequences a_i and b_i, (sum a_i b_i)^2 \u2264 (sum a_i^2) (sum b_i^2).\n\nBut here, I have sum x_i^2 under a square root on the left, and on the right, sum x_i / sqrt(i). So perhaps I can apply Cauchy-Schwarz to the right-hand side.\n\nSet a_i = x_i and b_i = 1/sqrt(i). Then by Cauchy-Schwarz:\n\n(sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i)^2 \u2264 (sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2) (sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2)\n\nThat is, (sum x_i / sqrt(i))^2 \u2264 (sum x_i^2) (sum 1/i)\n\nsum b_i^2 = sum (1/sqrt(i))^2 = sum 1/i.\n\nBut I need to relate this to the left-hand side of the inequality. The left-hand side is sqrt(sum x_i^2), and I have (sum x_i / sqrt(i))^2 \u2264 (sum x_i^2) (sum 1/i)\n\nSo, sqrt(sum x_i^2) \u2265 (sum x_i / sqrt(i)) / sqrt(sum 1/i)\n\nBut that's the opposite direction of what I want. I need an upper bound for sqrt(sum x_i^2), but here I have a lower bound.\n\nThat doesn't help. Maybe I need to adjust the application.\n\nSince the sequence is decreasing, perhaps I can use summation by parts or some Abel transformation.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can consider the difference or use induction.\n\nLet me try induction on n.\n\nFor n=1, left side: sqrt(x_1^2) = x_1\n\nRight side: x_1 / sqrt(1) = x_1\n\nSo equality holds, so it's true for n=1.\n\nNow assume it's true for n-1, i.e., sqrt(sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i^2) \u2264 sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i / sqrt(i)\n\nI need to show for n: sqrt(sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2) \u2264 sum_{i=1}^n x_i / sqrt(i)\n\nSet S_n = sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2, so left side is sqrt(S_n)\n\nRight side is sum_{i=1}^n x_i / sqrt(i)\n\nFrom induction hypothesis, sqrt(S_{n-1}) \u2264 sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i / sqrt(i)\n\nSo, if I let T_n = sum_{i=1}^n x_i / sqrt(i), then I have sqrt(S_{n-1}) \u2264 T_{n-1}\n\nI need sqrt(S_n) \u2264 T_n\n\nBut S_n = S_{n-1} + x_n^2\n\nT_n = T_{n-1} + x_n / sqrt(n)\n\nSo I need sqrt(S_{n-1} + x_n^2) \u2264 T_{n-1} + x_n / sqrt(n)\n\nSince sqrt(S_{n-1}) \u2264 T_{n-1}, if I can show that sqrt(S_{n-1} + x_n^2) - sqrt(S_{n-1}) \u2264 x_n / sqrt(n), then adding to the inequality for n-1 would give the result.\n\nIs that true? Let me see.\n\nSet a = sqrt(S_{n-1}), b = x_n, so I need sqrt(a^2 + b^2) - a \u2264 b / sqrt(n)\n\nSince a and b are positive.\n\nNow, sqrt(a^2 + b^2) - a = [ (a^2 + b^2) - a^2 ] / [sqrt(a^2 + b^2) + a] = b^2 / [sqrt(a^2 + b^2) + a]\n\nSince sqrt(a^2 + b^2) \u2265 a, this is \u2264 b^2 / (a + a) = b^2 / (2a)\n\nSo sqrt(a^2 + b^2) - a \u2264 b^2 / (2a)\n\nI need this to be \u2264 b / sqrt(n)\n\nSo I need b^2 / (2a) \u2264 b / sqrt(n)\n\nAssuming b > 0, divide both sides: b / (2a) \u2264 1 / sqrt(n)\n\nSo b \u2264 2a / sqrt(n)\n\nBut b = x_n, a = sqrt(S_{n-1})\n\nSo I need x_n \u2264 2 sqrt(S_{n-1}) / sqrt(n)\n\nIs this true? Not necessarily, because the sequence is decreasing, but S_{n-1} could be small.\n\nFor example, if the sequence is constant, say x_i = c for all i, then left side sqrt(sum c^2) = sqrt(n c^2) = c sqrt(n)\n\nRight side sum c / sqrt(i) \u2248 c integral_1^n dx/sqrt(x) = c * 2(sqrt(n) - 1) \u2248 2c sqrt(n)\n\nSo left is c sqrt(n), right is about 2c sqrt(n), so inequality holds, but in this case, x_n = c, sqrt(S_{n-1}) = c sqrt(n-1), so x_n \u2264 2 sqrt(S_{n-1}) / sqrt(n) becomes c \u2264 2 c sqrt(n-1) / sqrt(n) \u2248 2c, which is true for large n, but for small n might not hold.\n\nAt n=2, x_2 = c, sqrt(S_1) = sqrt(x_1^2) = c, so c \u2264 2c / sqrt(2) = c sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414 c, which is true since 1 < 1.414.\n\nAt n=1, we don't have this, but for n=2, it's ok.\n\nBut is it always true? Suppose the sequence decreases rapidly. Say x_1 = M large, x_2 = x_3 = ... = epsilon small.\n\nThen S_{n-1} for n=2 is S_1 = x_1^2 = M^2, so sqrt(S_1) = M, so I need x_2 \u2264 2M / sqrt(2)\n\nIf x_2 is large, say if I set x_2 = M, but the sequence is decreasing, so if it's constant, we saw it's ok, but if it decreases, x_2 < x_1, so x_2 \u2264 x_1, and 2x_1 / sqrt(2) \u2248  = x_1 * 1.414, so since x_2 \u2264 x_1 < 1.414 x_1, it holds.\n\nBut what if n is large and S_{n-1} is small. Suppose at some point, the sum S_{n-1} is small, but x_n is not too small.\n\nSince the sequence is decreasing and positive, x_n is small when n is large, but S_{n-1} is the sum of squares, which might be large if earlier terms are large.\n\nActually, because the sequence is decreasing, x_k is at least x_n for k< n, so S_{n-1} = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i^2 \u2265 sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_n^2 = (n-1) x_n^2\n\nSo sqrt(S_{n-1}) \u2265 sqrt( (n-1) x_n^2 ) = x_n sqrt(n-1)\n\nTherefore, 2 sqrt(S_{n-1}) / sqrt(n) \u2265 2 x_n sqrt(n-1) / sqrt(n) = 2 x_n sqrt(1 - 1/n) > 2 x_n * (1 - 1/(2n)) for large n, but anyway, since sqrt(1 - 1/n) > 0, and for n\u22652, sqrt(n-1)/sqrt(n) = sqrt(1 - 1/n) \u2265 sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2) > 0.7 for n=2, and increases to 1.\n\nSpecifically, sqrt(n-1)/sqrt(n) \u2265 sqrt(1/2) for n\u22652, but for n=1 we handle separately.\n\nSo 2 sqrt(S_{n-1}) / sqrt(n) \u2265 2 x_n * sqrt( (n-1)/n ) \u2265 2 x_n * (1/sqrt(2)) for n\u22652, since min at n=2.\n\nAt n=2, sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2) \u2248 0.707, so 2 * 0.707 x_n \u2248 1.414 x_n > x_n.\n\nSince x_n >0, and 2 sqrt( (n-1)/n ) >1 for n\u22652? At n=2, 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)\u22481.414>1, and as n increases, it approaches 2>1, so yes, 2 sqrt(S_{n-1}) / sqrt(n) \u2265 2 x_n sqrt( (n-1)/n ) > x_n for n\u22652.\n\nTherefore, x_n \u2264 2 sqrt(S_{n-1}) / sqrt(n) for n\u22652.\n\nFor n=1, we have equality as before.\n\nNow, back to the induction step.\n\nI had that sqrt(S_n) - sqrt(S_{n-1}) = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) - a \u2264 b^2 / (2a) with a=sqrt(S_{n-1}), b=x_n\n\nBut since b^2 / (2a) \u2264 (b / sqrt(n)) * (b / (2a) * sqrt(n) )\n\nFrom earlier, I need sqrt(a^2 + b^2) - a \u2264 b / sqrt(n)\n\nAnd I have sqrt(a^2 + b^2) - a \u2264 b^2 / (2a)\n\nAnd since b \u2264 2a / sqrt(n), as we just established for n\u22652, then b^2 / (2a) \u2264 (2a / sqrt(n)) * b / (2a) = b / sqrt(n)\n\nExactly!\n\nBecause b \u2264 2a / sqrt(n) implies b^2 / (2a) \u2264 (2a / sqrt(n)) * b / (2a) = b / sqrt(n)\n\nSo yes, sqrt(a^2 + b^2) - a \u2264 b^2 / (2a) \u2264 b / sqrt(n)\n\nTherefore, for n\u22652,\n\nsqrt(S_n) = sqrt(S_{n-1} + x_n^2) \u2264 sqrt(S_{n-1}) + [sqrt(S_{n-1} + x_n^2) - sqrt(S_{n-1})] \u2264 T_{n-1} + x_n / sqrt(n) = T_n\n\nBy induction hypothesis sqrt(S_{n-1}) \u2264 T_{n-1}, and we have the increment bounded.\n\nFor n=1, equality.\n\nSo by induction, it holds for all n.\n\nI should confirm for n=2.\n\nLet x1, x2 decreasing positive.\n\nLeft: sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2)\n\nRight: x1 /1 + x2 / sqrt(2) = x1 + x2 / sqrt(2)\n\nSince x2 \u2264 x1, x1^2 + x2^2 \u2264 x1^2 + x1 x2? Not sure.\n\nNote that (x1 + x2 / sqrt(2))^2 = x1^2 + 2 x1 x2 / sqrt(2) + (x2^2)/2 = x1^2 + \\sqrt{2} x1 x2 + 0.5 x2^2\n\nLeft side squared is x1^2 + x2^2\n\nNow, x1^2 + x2^2 \u2264 x1^2 + \\sqrt{2} x1 x2 + 0.5 x2^2 ?\n\nThis is equivalent to 0 \u2264 \\sqrt{2} x1 x2 - 0.5 x2^2\n\nSince x2 >0, divide: 0 \u2264 \\sqrt{2} x1 - 0.5 x2\n\nBut since x2 \u2264 x1, \\sqrt{2} x1 - 0.5 x2 \u2265 \\sqrt{2} x1 - 0.5 x1 = x1 (\\sqrt{2} - 0.5) >0 since \\sqrt{2}\u22481.414>0.5.\n\nEquality when x2=x1 and the difference is zero? When x2=x1, left squared x1^2 + x1^2=2x1^2, right squared (x1 + x1 / sqrt(2))^2 = x1^2 (1 + 1/sqrt(2))^2 = x1^2 (1 + 2/sqrt(2) + 1/2) = x1^2 (1 + \\sqrt{2} + 0.5) \u2248 x1^2 (1 + 1.414 + 0.5)=2.914 x1^2 > 2x1^2, so strict inequality.\n\nIn the expression above, \\sqrt{2} x1 - 0.5 x2 \u2265 \\sqrt{2} x1 - 0.5 x1 >0, so yes.\n\nSo for n=2 it holds.\n\nThus, by induction, part a) is proven.\n\nNow, part b) is trickier. I need to show that sum_{m=1}^\u221e 1/sqrt(m) * (sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2)^{1/2} \u2264 C sum_{i=1}^\u221e x_i for some constant C.\n\nSince the sequence is decreasing and positive, the sum sum x_i converges if and only if the sequence is summable, but here we have sum x_i assumed to converge? The inequality is to be bounded by sum x_i, so probably we assume that sum x_i < \u221e, otherwise it might not make sense, but since it's an inequality, if sum x_i = \u221e, right side is infinite, so inequality holds trivially. So we can assume sum x_i < \u221e, and since x_i decreasing to 0, sum converges.\n\nSimilarly, for the left side, since x_i \u21920, sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2 \u21920 as m\u2192\u221e, so it's well-defined.\n\nNow, I need to bound the sum over m of 1/sqrt(m) times the l2 norm of the tail.\n\nPart a) was for finite n, but here it's infinite.\n\nI recall that for decreasing sequences, there might be connections to Hardy's inequality or something similar.\n\nHardy's inequality is about sum (1/n sum_{k=1}^n x_k)^p \u2264 C sum x_k^p for p>1, but here it's different.\n\nIn part a), we have an inequality that looks similar to Hardy or to Cesaro means, but not exactly.\n\nIn part a), we have sqrt(sum x_i^2) \u2264 sum x_i / sqrt(i), which is a bit like a weighted sum.\n\nFor part b), I need to sum over m the tail norm.\n\nSet y_m = (sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2)^{1/2}\n\nThen I need sum_{m=1}^\u221e y_m / sqrt(m) \u2264 C sum_{i=1}^\u221e x_i\n\nBut y_m is the l2 norm of the tail.\n\nSince the sequence is decreasing, I could relate y_m to the sum of x_i.\n\nNote that y_m^2 = sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2\n\nSince x_i is decreasing, for i \u2265 m, x_i \u2264 x_m, but that might not be tight.\n\nAnother idea: use summation by parts.\n\nOr perhaps express the sum in terms of the x_i.\n\nLet me write the left side: sum_{m=1}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\left( \\sum_{i=m}^{\\infty} x_i^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n\nThis looks messy because of the square root. Maybe I can work with the squares or find another way.\n\nNotice that by part a), for each n, we have an inequality, but here it's infinite.\n\nAnother thought: since y_m = (sum_{k=m}^\u221e x_k^2)^{1/2}, and I need sum m^{-1/2} y_m.\n\nBut y_m is decreasing? Is y_m decreasing? Since as m increases, we start summing later, and since x_i \u22650, y_m is decreasing in m. Yes, because we remove positive terms as m increases.\n\nMoreover, y_m \u21920 as m\u2192\u221e.\n\nNow, the right side is sum x_i, which is like the l1 norm.\n\nI recall that for sequences, there are inequalities relating l_p norms, but here it's a weighted sum.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that for decreasing sequences, the l2 norm can be controlled by l1 or something.\n\nAnother idea: use Cauchy-Schwarz on the sum over m.\n\nConsider the double sum.\n\nNote that sum_{m=1}^\u221e y_m / sqrt(m) = sum_{m=1}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\left( \\sum_{i=m}^{\\infty} x_i^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n\nNow, \\left( \\sum_{i=m}^{\\infty} x_i^2 \\right)^{1/2} is the l2 norm of the sequence starting at m.\n\nI could write this as sum_{m=1}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} y_m, and since y_m is decreasing, and I need to sum it against m^{-1/2}, which is not summable, but y_m decreases.\n\nPerhaps I can bound y_m in terms of the sum of x_k.\n\nSince x_i is decreasing, for each i, and for k \u2265 i, x_k \u2264 x_i, but for the tail sum, perhaps I can use integral estimates.\n\nNote that for a fixed i, how many times does x_i appear in the sum.\n\nIn the expression sum_{m=1}^\u221e y_m / sqrt(m), and y_m = (sum_{k=m}^\u221e x_k^2)^{1/2}, so when I expand, it's a bit complicated.\n\nI recall that in part a), we have a pointwise inequality for the partial sums.\n\nBut here it's the tail.\n\nSet S_m = sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2, so y_m = sqrt(S_m)\n\nI need sum_{m=1}^\u221e y_m / sqrt(m)\n\nS_m = sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2\n\nSince x_i is decreasing, I can bound S_m in terms of x_m.\n\nFor example, since x_i \u2264 x_m for i\u2265m, S_m \u2264 sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_m^2 = x_m^2 * sum_{j=0}^\u221e 1, but that diverges, so not helpful.\n\nBetter: since x_i is decreasing, for i \u2265 m, x_i \u2264 x_m, so S_m = sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2 \u2264 x_m sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i\n\nBut sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i is the tail of the sum, which is finite, but still.\n\nS_m \u2264 x_m A_m, where A_m = sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i\n\nBut then y_m = sqrt(S_m) \u2264 sqrt(x_m A_m)\n\nThen sum_m y_m / sqrt(m) \u2264 sum_m sqrt(x_m A_m) / sqrt(m)\n\nBut A_m is decreasing to 0, and x_m decreasing.\n\nBut still messy.\n\nNote that A_m = sum_{k=m}^\u221e x_k\n\nSince the sequence is decreasing, I can bound A_m.\n\nFor example, by integral test, since x_i decreasing, sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i \u2264 x_m + \\int_m^\u221e x(t) dt, but I don't have a function.\n\nSince it's discrete, sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i \u2264 \\int_{m-1}^\u221e x(t) dt, but it's a bit vague.\n\nI recall that for decreasing sequences, sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i \u2264 \\int_{m-1}^\u221e x(t) dt if I define x(t) properly, but perhaps I can use the fact that x_k \u2264 \\frac{1}{k} sum_{i=1}^k x_i or something, but not sure.\n\nAnother idea: use Abel summation or partial summation.\n\nLet me try to express the sum sum_m y_m / sqrt(m) in terms of the x_i.\n\nNote that S_m = sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2 = sum_{i=1}^\u221e x_i^2 - sum_{i=1}^{m-1} x_i^2\n\nBut that might not help.\n\nI can write S_m = sum_{k=0}^\u221e x_{m+k}^2\n\nThen y_m = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\u221e x_{m+k}^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n\nThen sum_{m=1}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\u221e x_{m+k}^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n\nNow, this looks like a double sum. Let j = m + k, then for each fixed j, when m \u2264 j, k = j - m \u22650.\n\nSo for each j, m from 1 to j.\n\nsum_{m=1}^\u221e sum_{k=0}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} x_{m+k} ? No, it's the square root of the sum, not sum of square roots.\n\nI have y_m, which is sqrt of sum of x_i^2, not sum of x_i.\n\nSo it's not linear, so I cannot interchange easily.\n\nThis is problematic.\n\nPerhaps I can use the inequality from part a).\n\nPart a) says that for each n, \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \\right)^{1/2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{x_i}{\\sqrt{i}}\n\nBut here in part b), I have the tail, not the head.\n\nFor the tail, since the sequence is decreasing, perhaps I can apply a similar inequality to the tail sequence.\n\nDefine z_k = x_{m+k-1} for k=1,2,3,... so that z_k is decreasing positive sequence starting from m.\n\nThen by part a), for any N, \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^N z_k^2 \\right)^{1/2} \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^N \\frac{z_k}{\\sqrt{k}}\n\nAs N\u2192\u221e, the left side becomes \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^\u221e z_k^2 \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2 \\right)^{1/2} = y_m\n\nThe right side becomes \\sum_{k=1}^\u221e \\frac{z_k}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\sum_{k=1}^\u221e \\frac{x_{m+k-1}}{\\sqrt{k}}\n\nk starts from 1, so when k=1, i=m, k=2, i=m+1, etc.\n\nSo y_m \u2264 \\sum_{k=1}^\u221e \\frac{x_{m+k-1}}{\\sqrt{k}}\n\nTherefore, y_m \u2264 \\sum_{j=m}^\u221e \\frac{x_j}{\\sqrt{j - m + 1}} \n\nSet j = m + k - 1, so when k=1, j=m, k=2, j=m+1, etc., so j \u2265 m, and k = j - m + 1\n\nSo y_m \u2264 \\sum_{j=m}^\u221e \\frac{x_j}{\\sqrt{j - m + 1}}\n\nNow, I need to sum this over m: sum_{m=1}^\u221e \\frac{y_m}{\\sqrt{m}} \\leq sum_{m=1}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\sum_{j=m}^\u221e \\frac{x_j}{\\sqrt{j - m + 1}}\n\nNow, interchange the sums. Since everything is positive, I can do that.\n\nSo sum_{m=1}^\u221e sum_{j=m}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\frac{x_j}{\\sqrt{j - m + 1}}\n\nFor each fixed j, sum over m such that m \u2264 j.\n\nSo for fixed j, m from 1 to j.\n\nSo the double sum is sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\frac{x_j}{\\sqrt{j - m + 1}}\n\nSince x_j is independent of m, I can factor it out:\n\nsum_{j=1}^\u221e x_j \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m} \\sqrt{j - m + 1}} \\right)\n\nSo now, I need to bound sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m} \\sqrt{j - m + 1}} \n\nSet k = m, so sum_{k=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} \\sqrt{j - k + 1}}\n\nI need to show that this sum is bounded by some constant independent of j.\n\nThat is, there exists C such that for all j, sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m} \\sqrt{j - m + 1}} \\leq C\n\nThen, since sum_{j=1}^\u221e x_j C = C sum x_j, and the left side is less than or equal to that, so done.\n\nIs this sum bounded? Let me compute it.\n\nSet a_m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m} \\sqrt{j - m + 1}}\n\nThis looks symmetric.

When m is near j, j - m +1 \u2248 j - m +1, while j - m is small, but since it's in the denominator, it might be different.\n\nFor example, when m=j, in the sum, a_j = 1 / \\sqrt{j} \\sqrt{1} = 1 / \\sqrt{j}\n\nIn the continuous version, at m=j, the integrand is 1 / \\sqrt{j (j - j)} undefined, but near m=j, it behaves like 1 / \\sqrt{j} / \\sqrt{j - m}, which is integrable.\n\nIn the sum, at m=j, it's 1 / \\sqrt{j} * 1, since \\sqrt{j - j +1} = \\sqrt{1}=1\n\nWhile in the integral, near m=j, \\int_{j-\\epsilon}^j \\frac{dm}{\\sqrt{m (j - m)}} \\approx \\int_{j-\\epsilon}^j \\frac{dm}{\\sqrt{j} \\sqrt{j - m}} since m\u2248j\n\nSet u = j - m, then \\int_0^\\epsilon \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{j} \\sqrt{u}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j}} \\int_0^\\epsilon u^{-1/2} du = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j}} [2 u^{1/2}]_0^\\epsilon = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{\\sqrt{j}}\n\nWhich goes to 0 as \\epsilon \u21920, so it's finite.\n\nBut in the sum, at m=j, the term is 1 / \\sqrt{j}, while in the continuous analog, near m=j, it's large, but in the sum, since we have j - m +1, when m=j, it's \\sqrt{1}, not \\sqrt{0}.\n\nSpecifically, for m close to j, say m = j - k +1 for k small, but let's see the difference.\n\nSet s_m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m (j - m + 1)}}\n\nCompare to t_m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m (j - m)}}\n\nBut t_m has singularity at m=0 and m=j.\n\nIn s_m, when m=1, s_1 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 \\cdot j} = 1/\\sqrt{j}\n\nt_1 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 \\cdot (j-1)} \u2248 1/\\sqrt{j} for large j.\n\nWhen m=j, s_j = 1 / \\sqrt{j \\cdot 1} = 1/\\sqrt{j}\n\nt_j undefined, but near m=j, say m=j-1, s_{j-1} = 1 / \\sqrt{(j-1) (j - (j-1) +1)} = 1 / \\sqrt{(j-1) \\cdot 2} = 1 / \\sqrt{2(j-1)}\n\nt_{j-1} = 1 / \\sqrt{(j-1) (j - (j-1))} = 1 / \\sqrt{(j-1) \\cdot 1} = 1 / \\sqrt{j-1}\n\nSo s_{j-1} = 1 / \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 1 / \\sqrt{j-1} \u2248 1 / \\sqrt{2} t_{j-1}\n\nSimilarly, for m near 1, similar.\n\nThe sum sum_{m=1}^j s_m = sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m (j - m + 1)}}\n\nNow, note that j - m + 1 \u2265 j - m, and since it's positive, but in the denominator, so \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j - m + 1}} \u2264 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j - m}} for m < j, but at m=j, it's defined.\n\nTo compare to the integral, I could consider the integral from 0.5 to j+0.5 or something to capture the sum.\n\nNote that for each m, s_m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m (j - m + 1)}}\n\nNow, j - m + 1 = (j + 1) - m\n\nSo s_m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m ( (j+1) - m ) }}\n\nNow, this is similar to the integrand for n=j+1.\n\nThe sum sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m ( (j+1) - m ) }}\n\nNow, compare to sum_{m=1}^{j+1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m ( (j+1) - m ) }} , but at m=j+1, it would be undefined if not careful.\n\nSet n = j+1, then sum_{m=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m (n - m ) }}\n\nNow, this sum is almost the same as sum_{m=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m (n - m ) }} but excluding m=n, and at m=0 it's infinite.\n\nThe full sum for fixed n, sum_{m=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m (n - m ) }}\n\nBy symmetry, and since the function is convex or something, but I can compare to the integral \\int_0^n \\frac{dm}{\\sqrt{m (n - m)} } = \\pi as before.\n\nNow, the sum sum_{m=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m (n - m ) }} \n\nNote that for m from 1 to n-1, the terms are positive.\n\nI can bound this sum by integrals.\n\nConsider the function f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x (n - x)} } for x in (0,n)\n\nThis function is decreasing in (0, n/2] and increasing in [n/2, n), but since it's symmetric, I can consider the behavior.\n\nFor x in [1, n-1], f(x) is bounded away from infinity?

Standard integral bounds.\n\nFor a decreasing function, but here f is not monotonic on [1,n-1].\n\nSince f has a minimum at x=n/2, and increases to infinity as x\u21920+ or x\u2192n-.\n\nBut since we are summing from m=1 to m=n-1, and at endpoints it's finite.\n\nThe integral \\int_1^{n-1} f(x) dx = \\int_1^{n-1} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x(n-x)}}\n\nAs before, this is similar to the beta function.\n\nSet u = x/n, then dx = n du, u from 1/n to (n-1)/n\n\n\\int_{1/n}^{(n-1)/n} \\frac{n du}{\\sqrt{ (n u) (n - n u) }} = \\int_{1/n}^{(n-1)/n} \\frac{n du}{n \\sqrt{u (1-u)} } = \\int_{1/n}^{(n-1)/n} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}}\n\nNow, \\int \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = \\int u^{-1/2} (1-u)^{-1)^{-1/2} du\n\nThis is the same as before, and the antiderivative is arcsin(2u - 1) or something? I think it's 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{u}) or related.\n\nNote that \\int_0^1 \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = B(1/2,1/2) = \\pi as before.\n\nNow, here from u=1/n to u=(n-1)/n.\n\nAs n\u2192\u221e, the integral \\int_{1/n}^{(n-1)/n} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} \u2192 \\int_0^1 \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = \\pi\n\nBut for finite n, it's less than \\pi.\n\nSpecifically, the missing parts are near 0 and 1.\n\nNear u=0, \\int_0^{1/n} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} \\approx \\int_0^{1/n} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u} \\cdot 1} = \\int_0^{1/n} u^{-1/2} du = [2 u^{1/2}]_0^{1/n} = 2 / \\sqrt{n}\n\nSimilarly near u=1, same thing by symmetry.\n\nSo \\int_{1/n}^{(n-1)/n} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = \\pi - \\int_0^{1/n} - \\cdots but since it's symmetric, the integral from 0 to 1/n is about 2/\\sqrt{n}, same for 1-1/n to 1.\n\nSo total integral is \\pi - O(1/\\sqrt{n})\n\nNow, this is for the integral from 1 to n-1 in x, but in u it's the same.\n\nBut in our sum, we have sum_{m=1}^{n-1} f(m), and we need to relate to the integral.\n\nThe sum \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} f(m) can be bounded by integrals.\n\nSpecifically, for a decreasing function on an interval, but f(x) = 1/\\sqrt{x(n-x)} is decreasing on [1, n/2] and increasing on [n/2, n-1], but since it's symmetric, I can consider the sum from m=1 to m=\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor and from m=\\lceil n/2 \\rceil to m=n-1.\n\nSince f(x) \\geq 0, and for x in [1,n-1], f(x) is convex or something, but perhaps simpler to use the fact that the sum is approximated by the integral.\n\nNote that by integral bounds, for a decreasing function g on [a,b], \\int_a^b g(x) dx \\leq \\sum_{m=a}^b g(m) \\leq g(a) + \\int_a^b g(x) dx, but here it's not monotonic.\n\nI recall that for such sums, \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m(n-m)}} \\leq C for some C.\n\nFrom the integral, \\int_1^{n-1} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x(n-x)}} = \\int_{1/n}^{(n-1)/n} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} \\leq \\int_0^1 \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = \\pi\n\nBut the sum might be larger than the integral.\n\nFor example, at m=1, f(1) = 1 / \\sqrt{1 \\cdot (n-1)} \\sim 1/\\sqrt{n}\n\nThe integral from 1 to 2 of f(x) dx might be less than f(1), etc.\n\nTo get an upper bound, I can use that f(m) \\leq \\int_{m-1}^m f(x) dx for m \u22652? Not necessarily.\n\nNote that for each m, f(m) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m(n-m)}}\n\nNow, when m is away from 1 and n, say m \u22652, n-m \u22652, then f(m) is bounded, but the issue is near the ends.\n\nSince the function is large near m=1 and m=n, but symmetric, I can write:\n\n\\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} f(m) = f(1) + f(n-1) + \\sum_{m=2}^{n-2} f(m) \n\nf(1) = 1/\\sqrt{1 \\cdot (n-1)} \\sim 1/\\sqrt{n}\n\nf(n-1) = 1/\\sqrt{(n-1) \\cdot 1} = 1/\\sqrt{n-1} \\sim 1/\\sqrt{n}\n\nNow for the sum from m=2 to n-2, if n is large, and f(x) is decreasing on [2, n/2], so for m from 2 to \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor, f(m) is decreasing, so\n\n\\sum_{m=2}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} f(m) \\leq \\int_1^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} f(x) dx \n\nSimilarly for the other side.\n\nBut \\int_1^{n/2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x(n-x)}} \n\nSet u = x/n, \\int_{1/n}^{1/2} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}}\n\nAs n\u2192\u221e, this goes to \\int_0^{1/2} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} \n\nSimilarly for the other half.\n\nBy symmetry, the sum from m=2 to n-2 is less than twice \\int_1^{n/2} f(x) dx\n\nNow \\int_1^{n/2} f(x) dx = \\int_{1/n}^{1/2} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}}\n\nNow this integral converges as n\u2192\u221e to \\int_0^{1/2} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} \n\nBut near u=0, it blows up, but for finite n, it's finite.\n\nIn fact, \\int_{1/n}^{1/2} u^{-1/2} (1-u)^{-1/2} du \\leq \\int_{1/n}^{1/2} u^{-1/2} du since (1-u)^{-1/2} \\leq (1-1/2)^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{2} for u\u22641/2, but actually for u near 0, (1-u)^{-1/2} \u22481, so better to use the exact value.\n\nThe antiderivative: let v = \\sqrt{u}, then \\int \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = \\int \\frac{2 v dv}{v \\sqrt{1 - v^2}} = 2 \\int \\frac{dv}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2}} = 2 \\arcsin(v) + C = 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{u}) + C\n\nSo \\int \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{u}) + C\n\nTherefore, \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{b}) - 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{a})\n\nIn particular, for a=1/n, b=1/2,\n\n2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{1/2}) - 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{1/n}) = 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{2}) - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n}) = 2 * (\\pi/4) - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n}) = \\pi/2 - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n})\n\nAs n\u2192\u221e, this goes to \\pi/2, but for finite n, it's less.\n\nSimilarly, for the other side.\n\nNow back to our sum.\n\n\\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} f(m) = \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m(n-m)}}\n\nWe have f(1) = 1/\\sqrt{1 \\cdot (n-1)} = 1 / \\sqrt{n-1}\n\nf(n-1) = 1 / \\sqrt{(n-1) \\cdot 1} = 1 / \\sqrt{n-1}\n\nNow, for m from 2 to n-2, since f is symmetric and decreasing on [1, n/2], but for m=2 to \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor, f(m) is decreasing.\n\nSo \\sum_{m=2}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} f(m) \\leq \\int_1^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} f(x) dx \\leq \\int_1^{n/2} f(x) dx\n\nSimilarly, \\sum_{m=\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}^{n-2} f(m) \\leq \\int_{n/2}^{n-1} f(x) dx ? But since f is increasing in [n/2, n), actually for x in [n/2, n-1], f is increasing, so the sum from m=k to l with k=\\lceil n/2 \\rceil, l=n-2, might be bounded by \\int_{k-1}^{l} f(x) dx or something.\n\nTo get an upper bound, note that \\sum_{m=2}^{n-2} f(m) \\leq \\int_{1}^{n-1} f(x) dx \n\nBecause f is convex or by integral test for decreasing and increasing parts, but since it dips in the minimum, actually the sum might be less than the integral over a shifted interval.\n\nA standard way is that for a positive function, \\sum_{m=1}^k g(m) \\leq g(1) + \\int_1^k g(x) dx if g decreasing, but here it's not.\n\nI know that \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} f(m) \\leq 2 \\sum_{m=1}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} f(m) by symmetry, and for m=1 to \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor, f(m) is decreasing.\n\nSo \\sum_{m=1}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} f(m) \\leq f(1) + \\int_1^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} f(x) dx\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut f(1) is already included.\n\nSet S_n = \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m(n-m)}}\n\nFor m=1 to n-1.\n\nf(1) = 1/\\sqrt{1 \\cdot (n-1)} = 1/\\sqrt{n-1}\n\nNow, for m\u22652, f(m) = 1/\\sqrt{m(n-m)}\n\nCompare to integral from m-0.5 to m+0.5, but perhaps overkill.\n\nNote that by Cauchy-Schwarz or other inequalities, but perhaps I can compute the asymptotic.\n\nFrom the integral, \\int_1^{n-1} f(x) dx = \\int_{1/n}^{(n-1)/n} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{u}) \\big|_{1/n}^{(n-1)/n} = 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{(n-1)/n}) - 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{1/n})\n\nNow \\sqrt{(n-1)/n} = \\sqrt{1 - 1/n} \\to 1, \\arcsin(1) = \\pi/2\n\n\\arcsin(\\sqrt{1/n}) \\to 0\n\nSo as n\u2192\u221e, it goes to 2*(\u03c0/2) - 2*0 = \u03c0\n\nBut for finite n, 2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{1 - 1/n}) - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n})\n\nNow \\arcsin(\\sqrt{1 - 1/n}) = \\arcsin(\\sqrt{(n-1)/n})\n\nSet \u03b8 = \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n}), so sin \u03b8 = 1/\\sqrt{n}, then \\cos \u03b8 = \\sqrt{1 - 1/n} = \\sqrt{(n-1)/n}\n\nThen \\arcsin(\\cos \u03b8) = \\arcsin(\\sin(\\pi/2 - \u03b8)) = \\pi/2 - \u03b8, since \u03b8 small, \\pi/2 - \u03b8 \\in (0,\\pi/2)\n\nSo \\arcsin(\\sqrt{(n-1)/n}) = \\pi/2 - \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n})\n\nThus integral = 2 [ (\\pi/2 - \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n}) ) - \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n}) ] = 2 [ \\pi/2 - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n}) ] = \\pi - 4 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{n})\n\nNow \\arcsin(x) \\sim x as x\u21920, so \u2248 \\pi - 4/\\sqrt{n}\n\nNow the sum S_n = \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} f(m)\n\nI claim that S_n \u2264 C for some C independent of n.\n\nFor example, when n=2, sum_{m=1}^{1} f(m) = f(1) = 1 / \\sqrt{1 \\cdot (2-1)} = 1 / \\sqrt{1 \\cdot 1} =1\n\nWhen n=3, sum_{m=1}^{2} f(m) = f(1) + f(2) = 1/\\sqrt{1 \\cdot (3-1)} + 1/\\sqrt{2 \\cdot (3-2)} = 1/\\sqrt{2} + 1/\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} \u22481.414\n\nWhen n=4, f(1)=1/\\sqrt{1\\cdot3}=1/\\sqrt{3}, f(2)=1/\\sqrt{2\\cdot2}=1/\\sqrt{4}=1/2, f(3)=1/\\sqrt{3\\cdot1}=1/\\sqrt{3}, so sum = 2/\\sqrt{3} + 0.5 \u2248 2/1.732 \u22481.154 +0.5=1.654\n\nWhen n=5, f(1)=1/\\sqrt{1\\cdot4}=1/2, f(2)=1/\\sqrt{2\\cdot3}=1/\\sqrt{6}\u22480.408, f(3)=1/\\sqrt{3\\cdot2}=1/\\sqrt{6}\u22480.408, f(4)=1/\\sqrt{4\\cdot1}=1/2, sum=0.5+0.408+0.408+0.5=1.816\n\nWhen n=10, f(1)=1/\\sqrt{1*9}=1/3\u22480.333, f(2)=1/\\sqrt{2*8}=1/\\sqrt{16}=0.25?

From the calculations, at n=10 (so j=9), sum\u22482.21, at n=20, let's compute roughly.\n\nFor n=20, sum_{m=1}^{19} 1/\\sqrt{m(20-m)}\n\nAt m=1, 1/\\sqrt{1*19}\u22481/4.358\u22480.229\n\nm=2,1/\\sqrt{2*18}=1/\\sqrt{36}=1/6\u22480.1667\n\nm=3,1/\\sqrt{3*17}=1/\\sqrt{51}\u22481/7.141\u22480.140\n\nm=4,1/\\sqrt{4*16}=1/\\sqrt{64}=1/8=0.125\n\nm=5,1/\\sqrt{5*15}=1/\\sqrt{75}\u22481/8.66\u22480.115\n\nm=6,1/\\sqrt{6*14}=1/\\sqrt{84}\u22481/9.165\u22480.109\n\nm=7,1/\\sqrt{7*13}=1/\\sqrt{91}\u22481/9.539\u22480.105\n\nm=8,1/\\sqrt{8*12}=1/\\sqrt{96}\u22481/9.798\u22480.102\n\nm=9,1/\\sqrt{9*11}=1/\\sqrt{99}\u22481/9.95\u22480.1005\n\nm=10,1/\\sqrt{10*10}=1/10=0.1\n\nThen symmetric for m=11 to 19.\n\nSo from m=1 to 10: 0.229, 0.1667, 0.140, 0.125, 0.115, 0.109, 0.105, 0.102, 0.1005, 0.1\n\nSum\u2248 0.229+0.1667\u22480.3957; +0.140\u22480.5357; +0.125\u22480.6607; +0.115\u22480.7757; +0.109\u22480.8847; +0.105\u22480.9897; +0.102\u22481.0917; +0.1005\u22481.1922; +0.1\u22481.2922\n\nThen m=11 same as m=9:0.1005? m=11:1/\\sqrt{11*9}=1/\\sqrt{99}\u22480.1005 same as m=9\n\nm=12: same as m=8:0.102\n\netc.\n\nActually, since symmetric, sum from m=11 to 19 is same as m=1 to 9, because m=11 corresponds to n-m=20-11=9, same as m=9, n-m=11? f(m)=1/\\sqrt{m(n-m)}, so f(11)=1/\\sqrt{11*9}=1/\\sqrt{99}, f(9)=1/\\sqrt{9*11}=same, so yes, symmetric.\n\nBut m from 1 to 19, n=20, so m=1 to 19, symmetric around m=10.\n\nm=10 is the middle, and m=1 and m=19, etc.\n\nSo sum from m=1 to 9 is same as m=11 to 19? m=1 to 9: m=1,2,...,9\n\nm=11 to 19: 11,12,...,19\n\nf(11)=1/\\sqrt{11*9}=f(9), f(12)=1/\\sqrt{12*8}=f(8), ..., f(19)=1/\\sqrt{19*1}=f(1)\n\nSo yes, sum_{m=11}^{19} f(m) = sum_{m=1}^{9} f(m)\n\nNow, from earlier, sum_{m=1}^{10} f(m) \u22481.2922? I have up to m=10: 1.2922, but that includes m=10.\n\nm=1 to 10: I computed about 1.2922, but this includes m=10 which is 0.1\n\nsum_{m=1}^9 \u22481.2922 - 0.1 = 1.1922? Earlier I added m=10 at the end: after m=9 sum was 1.1922, plus m=10=0.1, total 1.2922 for m=1 to 10.\n\nBut since n=20, sum up to m=19, and m=10 is included only once.\n\nSo total sum S_{20} = sum_{m=1}^{19} f(m) = [sum_{m=1}^{9} f(m)] + f(10) + [sum_{m=11}^{19}19 f(m)] = 2 * sum_{m=1}^{9} f(m) + f(10)\n\nsum_{m=1}^9 \u22481.1922, f(10)=0.1\n\nSo 2*1.1922 + 0.1 = 2.3844 + 0.1 = 2.4844\n\nNow integral was \\pi - 4 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{20}) \u2248 3.1416 - 4*(1/\\sqrt{20}) since \\arcsin x \u2248 x for small x, 1/sqrt(20)=1/(2\u221a5)\u22481/4.472\u22480.2236, times 4\u22480.8944, so 3.1416-0.8944\u22482.2472, but our sum is 2.4844 > 2.2472? That can't be.\n\nI think I messed up.\n\nsum_{m=1}^9 f(m): from earlier calculation: for m=1 to 9: 0.229,0.1667,0.140,0.125,0.115,0.109,0.105,0.102,0.1005\n\nAdd them: 0.229 + 0.1667 = 0.3957\n\n+0.140 = 0.5357\n\n+0.125 = 0.6607\n\n+0.115 = 0.7757\n\n+0.109 = 0.8847\n\n+0.105 = 0.9897\n\n+0.102 = 1.0917\n\n+0.1005 = 1.1922 yes.\n\nBut this is sum for m=1 to 9, but f(m) for each.\n\nNow for S_{20} = sum_{m=1}^{19} f(m) = f(1)+f(2)+...+f(19)\n\nf(1)=0.229, f(19)=f(1)=0.229\n\nf(2)=0.1667, f(18)=f(2)=0.1667? f(18)=1/\\sqrt{18*2}=1/\\sqrt{36}=1/6\u22480.1667 same as f(2)\n\nSimilarly, f(3)=1/\\sqrt{3*17}\u22480.140, f(17)=1/\\sqrt{17*3}=same\n\n...\n\nf(9)=1/\\sqrt{9*11}\u22480.1005, f(11)=same\n\nf(10)=1/\\sqrt{10*10}=0.1\n\nf(19)=f(1)=0.229, etc.\n\nSo pairs: m=1 and 19: 0.229 + 0.229 = 0.458\n\nm=2 and 18: 0.1667 + 0.1667 = 0.3334\n\nm=3 and 17: 0.140 + 0.140 = 0.280\n\nm=4 and 16: 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.250? f(16)=1/\\sqrt{16*4}=1/\\sqrt{64}=1/8=0.125, yes\n\nm=5 and 15: 0.115 + 0.115 = 0.230? f(15)=1/\\sqrt{15*5}=1/\\sqrt{75}\u22481/8.66\u22480.1154\n\nm=6 and 14: 0.109 + 0.109 = 0.218? f(14)=1/\\sqrt{14*6}=1/\\sqrt{84}\u22481/9.165\u22480.1091\n\nm=7 and 13: 0.105 + 0.105 = 0.210? f(13)=1/\\sqrt{13*7}=1/\\sqrt{91}\u22481/9.539\u22480.1048, say 0.105\n\nm=8 and 12: 0.102 + 0.102 = 0.204? f(12)=1/\\sqrt{12*8}=1/\\sqrt{96}\u22481/9.798\u22480.1021\n\nm=9 and 11: 0.1005 + 0.1005 = 0.201\n\nAnd m=10: 0.1\n\nNow sum of pairs: 0.458 + 0.3334 = 0.7914\n\n+0.280 = 1.0714\n\n+0.250 = 1.3214\n\n+0.230 \u22481.5514?

No, m=10 is only once in the whole sum.\n\nIn sum_{m=1}^{19}, m=10 is included once, while in 2*sum_{m=1}^{10}, it includes m=10 twice? sum_{m=1}^{10} includes m=1 to 10, and if I double it, I get m=1 to 10 and again, but m=11 to 19 are missing, and m=10 is extra.\n\nBetter: S_n = \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} f(m) = f(1) + f(2) + \\cdots + f(n-1)\n\nBy symmetry, f(m) = f(n-m), so if n is odd, middle term once, else no middle.\n\nFor n=20 even, no middle, so S_n = 2 \\sum_{m=1}^{9} f(m) + f(10)?

From n=10, 2.2112 < \u03c0\u22483.14, n=20\u22482.4844<3.14, and increases, but never reaches \u03c0, so yes, bounded by \u03c0.\n\nFor n=100, it would be closer to \u03c0.\n\nSo sum_{j=1}^\u221e x_j \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m} \\sqrt{j - m + 1}} \\right) \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^\u221e x_j \\cdot \\pi\n\nTherefore, the left side of part b) is \u2264 \u03c0 sum_{j=1}^\u221e x_j\n\nSo C = \u03c0 works.\n\nIn the chain, we have sum_{m} y_m / \\sqrt{m} \\leq sum_{m} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} sum_{j=m}^\u221e \\frac{x_j}{\\sqrt{j - m + 1}} = sum_j x_j sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m} \\sqrt{j - m + 1}} \\leq \\pi sum_j x_j\n\nAnd since the sequence is positive, all is well.\n\nIn part b), the right side is sum_{i=1}^\u221e x_i, same as sum_j x_j.\n\nSo constant C = \u03c0.\n\nBut is this the best? Probably not, but it works.\n\nI could get a smaller constant, but it's fine.\n\nNow, to confirm, in part a), we used that the sequence is decreasing to apply the inequality to the tail, which we did.\n\nAnd in the sum, we interchanged, which is fine for positive terms.\n\nSo that should be it.\n\nNow for part b), the constant is C=\u03c0.\n\nBut let me see if it's sharp.\n\nSuppose x_i = 1/i^{1/2 + \\epsilon} for small \\epsilon, but since decreasing, and sum x_i converges if \\epsilon>0.\n\nBut to check the constant.\n\nSuppose constant sequence, but constant sequence sum x_i diverges, so not good.\n\nSuppose x_i = 1/i, then sum x_i = \\sum 1/i diverges, so right side infinite.\n\nTake x_i = 1/i^{3/2}, which is summable.\n\nThen sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2 = sum_{i=m}^\u221e i^{-3}\n\nSince (1/i^{3/2})^2 = i^{-3}\n\nsum_{i=m}^\u221e i^{-3} \\approx \\int_m^\u221e t^{-3} dt = [ -1/(2 t^2) ]_m^\u221e = 1/(2 m^2)\n\nSo y_m = \\sqrt{ sum_{i=m}^\u221e x_i^2 } \\approx \\sqrt{1/(2 m^2)} = 1/(m \\sqrt{2})\n\nThen left side sum_{m=1}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} y_m \\approx sum_{m=1}^\u221e \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\frac{1}{m \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sum m^{-3/2}\n\nRight side sum x_i = \\sum i^{-3/2}\n\nNow \\sum m^{-3/2} is convergent, same order.\n\nThe constant: left is \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\zeta(3/2), right is \\zeta(3/2), so ratio 1/\\sqrt{2} \u22480.707, while \u03c0\u22483.14, so not tight, but since it's bounded, it's ok.\n\nTo get a better constant, but not necessary.\n\nSo for the proof, we have it.\n\nNow to write it up.\n",

Since \\(j \\geq 1\\), we must have \\(k-m+1 \\geq 1\\), which means \\(k-m \\geq 0\\), so \\(m \\leq k\\).\nSince \\(m \\geq 1\\), \\(m\\) ranges from \\(1\\) to \\(k\\).\nSo the sum becomes:\n\\[ LHS = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}\\sqrt{k-m+1}} \\right). \\]\nLet \\(H_k = \\sum_{m=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}\\sqrt{k-m+1}}\\). If we can show that \\(H_k\\) is bounded by a constant \\(C_0\\) for all \\(k \\geq 1\\), then \\(LHS \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k C_0 = C_0 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k\\). This would prove the inequality with \\(C=C_0\\).\n\nWe need to bound \\(H_k = \\sum_{m=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m(k-m+1)}}\\).\nLet \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x(k+1-x)}}\\). Then \\(H_k = \\sum_{m=1}^{k} f(m)\\).\nThe function \\(g(x) = x(k+1-x)\\) is a downward-opening parabola with maximum at \\(x=(k+1)/2\\).\nThe function \\(h(t)=1/\\sqrt{t}\\) is convex for \\(t>0\\), since \\(h''(t) = \\frac{3}{4}t^{-5/2} > 0\\). Also, \\(h(t)\\) is decreasing.\nThe function \\(g(x)\\) is concave for \\(x \\in (0, k+1)\\) and \\(g(x)>0\\) there.\nSince \\(f(x)=h(g(x))\\), \\(f(x)\\) is convex on \\((0, k+1)\\). This can be shown by computing the second derivative:\n\\(f'(x) = h'(g(x))g'(x)\\).\n\\(f''(x) = h''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + h'(g(x))g''(x)\\).\nSince \\(h\\) is convex, \\(h'' \\geq 0\\). Since \\(h\\) is decreasing, \\(h' \\leq 0\\). Since \\(g\\) is concave, \\(g'' \\leq 0\\).\nAll terms are therefore non-negative: \\((g'(x))^2 \\geq 0\\), \\(h''(g(x)) \\geq 0\\), \\(h'(g(x)) \\leq 0\\), \\(g''(x) \\leq 0\\), so \\(h'(g(x))g''(x) \\geq 0\\).\nThus \\(f''(x) \\geq 0\\) on \\((0, k+1)\\), so \\(f(x)\\) is convex on \\((0, k+1)\\).\n\nFor a convex function \\(f\\), it is known that \\(f(m) \\leq \\int_{m-1/2}^{m+1/2} f(x)dx\\).\nSumming from \\(m=1\\) to \\(k\\):\n\\[ H_k = \\sum_{m=1}^{k} f(m) \\leq \\sum_{m=1}^{k} \\int_{m-1/2}^{m+1/2} f(x)dx = \\int_{1/2}^{k+1/2} f(x)dx. \\]\nThe domain of integration \\([1/2, k+1/2]\\) is within \\((0, k+1)\\) where \\(f(x)\\) is convex.\nSo we need to evaluate the integral \\(\\int_{1/2}^{k+1/2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x(k+1-x)}}\\).\nLet \\(x = (k+1)u\\). Then \\(dx = (k+1)du\\).\nThe limits of integration become \\(u_1 = \\frac{1/2}{k+1} = \\frac{1}{2(k+1)}\\) and \\(u_2 = \\frac{k+1/2}{k+1} = \\frac{2k+1}{2(k+1)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2(k+1)}\\).\nThe integral becomes:\n\\[ \\int_{1/(2(k+1))}^{1-1/(2(k+1))} \\frac{(k+1)du}{\\sqrt{(k+1)u(k+1-(k+1)u)}} = \\int_{1/(2(k+1))}^{1-1/(2(k+1))} \\frac{(k+1)du}{(k+1)\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = \\int_{1/(2(k+1))}^{1-1/(2(k+1))} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}}. \\]\nThis integral is standard. \\(\\int \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} = \\arcsin(2u-1) + \\text{const}\\).\nSo,\n\\begin{align*} \\int_{1/(2(k+1))}^{1-1/(2(k+1))} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u(1-u)}} &= \\left[ \\arcsin(2u-1) \\right]_{1/(2(k+1))}^{1-1/(2(k+1))} \\\\ &= \\arcsin\\left(2\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2(k+1)}\\right)-1\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(2\\left(\\frac{1}{2(k+1)}\\right)-1\\right) \\\\ &= \\arcsin\\left(2-\\frac{1}{k+1}-1\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{k+1}-1\\right) \\\\ &= \\arcsin\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\right)\\right) \\end{align*}\nSince \\(\\arcsin(-z) = -\\arcsin(z)\\), this is:\n\\[ \\arcsin\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\right) - \\left(-\\arcsin\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\right)\\right) = 2\\arcsin\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\right). \\]\nSince \\(k \\geq 1\\), \\(k+1 \\geq 2\\). So \\(0 < \\frac{1}{k+1} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\).\nThen \\(1/2 \\leq 1-\\frac{1}{k+1} < 1\\).\nThe function \\(\\arcsin(z)\\) is increasing on \\([-1,1]\\).\nSo \\(2\\arcsin(1/2) \\leq 2\\arcsin(1-\\frac{1}{k+1}) < 2\\arcsin(1)\\).\n\\(2(\\pi/6) \\leq 2\\arcsin(1-\\frac{1}{k+1}) < 2(\\pi/2)\\).\nSo \\(\\pi/3 \\leq H_k < \\pi\\).\nTherefore, \\(H_k\\) is bounded by \\(\\pi\\).\nThus, we have \\(H_k \\leq \\pi\\) for all \\(k \\geq 1\\).\n\nSubstituting this back:\n\\[ \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} S_m \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k H_k \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k \\pi = \\pi \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k. \\]\nThis shows that the inequality holds with \\(C=\\pi\\).\nAll steps are justified assuming the sum \\(\\sum x_i\\) converges. If \\(\\sum x_i\\) diverges, then the RHS is \\(\\infty\\). Since all terms are positive, the inequality holds trivially if \\(\\sum x_i\\) diverges. We must assume that if \\(\\sum x_i\\) diverges, the LHS may also diverge but must be \\(\\leq \\infty\\). This is standard for such inequalities. If \\(\\sum x_i\\) converges, then \\(x_i \\to 0\\). This implies \\(x_i^2\\) goes to zero faster, so \\(\\sum x_i^2\\) converges. All series involved are convergent if \\(\\sum x_i\\) is.\n\nFinal check for edge cases:\nFor \\(k=1\\), \\(H_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1}\\sqrt{1-1+1}} = 1\\). The bound gives \\(2\\arcsin(1-1/2) = 2\\arcsin(1/2) = 2(\\pi/6) = \\pi/3 \\approx 1.047\\). So \\(1 \\leq \\pi/3\\). This is true.\n\nThe argument relies on \\(f(m) \\leq \\int_{m-1/2}^{m+1/2} f(x)dx\\) which is a consequence of convexity:\nSince \\(f\\) is convex, for \\(x \\in [m-1/2, m+1/2]\\), \\(f(m) = f(\\frac{m-1/2+m+1/2}{2}) \\leq \\frac{1}{1}\\int_{m-1/2}^{m+1/2} f(x)dx\\) by Jensen's inequality for integrals. More precisely, \\(f(E[X]) \\leq E[f(X)]\\). Let \\(X\\) be a random variable uniformly distributed on \\([m-1/2, m+1/2]\\). Then \\(E[X]=m\\). So \\(f(m) \\leq \\int_{m-1/2}^{m+1/2} f(x) \\frac{1}{(m+1/2)-(m-1/2)} dx = \\int_{m-1/2}^{m+1/2} f(x)dx\\). This is correct.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\left(\\sum_{i=m}^{\\infty} x_{i}^{2}\\right)^{1/2} \\leq C \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_{i}}$.",

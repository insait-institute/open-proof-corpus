In every column with more than two tokens, we have token emit a bidirectional horizontal death ray (laser) covering its entire row: the hypothesis is that the death ray won't hit any other tokens.\n\n\nAssume there are $n$ tokens and that $n>1000$. Then obviously some column has more than two tokens, so at most $999$ tokens don't emit a death ray (namely, any token in its own column). Thus there are at least $n-999$ death rays. On the other hand, we can have at most $999$ death rays total (since it would not be okay for the whole board to have death rays, as some row should have more than two tokens). Therefore, $n \\leq 999+999=1998$ as desired.",

So, the triangle is formed by three points:\n\n- $ (i, j) $ \u2014 the right angle vertex\n- $ (i, k) $ \u2014 another point in the same row\n- $ (l, j) $ \u2014 another point in the same column\n\nThus, for such a triangle to exist, there must be **two points in the same row** and **two points in the same column**, with the third point being the intersection of that row and column.\n\nThis leads to the key insight:\n\n> **If any colored square has at least one other colored square in its row and one in its column, then those three squares form a right triangle.**\n\nTherefore, to **avoid** such a triangle, we must ensure that **for every colored square**, either:\n- It is the **only** colored square in its row, or\n- It is the **only** colored square in its column.\n\nThis is a **crucial condition** that defines the structure of the colored squares.\n\n---\n\n### Reformulating the Problem\n\nWe are to find the **maximum number of colored squares** that can be placed on the board **without forming such a triangle**, and then **add 1** to that number to get the **smallest $ n $** that **forces** the triangle to exist.\n\nThis is equivalent to the following:\n\n> **What is the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph (rows \u00d7 columns) such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex of degree 1?**\n\nThis is a known problem in extremal combinatorics. The maximum number of such edges in an $ n \\times n $ bipartite graph is $ 2n - 1 $, and this bound is tight.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing the Maximal Example\n\nTo achieve the maximum of $ 2n - 1 = 1999 $ colored squares on a $ 1000 \\times 1000 $ board without forming a right triangle, we can use the following construction:\n\n- Color all squares in **row 1** **except** the square at column 1.\n- Color all squares in **column 1** **except** the square at row 1.\n\nThis gives:\n\n- $ 999 $ colored squares in row 1 (excluding the first column),\n- $ 999 $ colored squares in column 1 (excluding the first row),\n- Total: $ 999 + 999 = 1998 $ colored squares.\n\nIn this configuration:\n\n- Every colored square in row 1 (except the one at column 1) is in a row with many colored squares, but their columns contain only one colored square (themselves).\n- Every colored square in column 1 (except the one at row 1) is in a column with many colored squares, but their rows contain only one colored square (themselves).\n- The square at (1,1) is **not** colored, so it does not form a triangle with any other colored square.\n\nThus, **no right triangle** is formed in this configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Adding One More Square\n\nNow, suppose we add **one more colored square** to this configuration, bringing the total to $ 1999 $. No matter where we place this square, it will either:\n\n- Be in a **row** that already has a colored square (i.e., row 1), and in a **column** that already has a colored square (i.e., column 1), forming a triangle with the two colored squares in that row and column.\n- Or be in a new row or column, but then it will form a triangle with the colored square in the corresponding row or column.\n\nIn **either case**, a right triangle is formed.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the **maximum number of colored squares** that can be placed on a $ 1000 \\times 1000 $ board **without** forming a right triangle with legs parallel to the edges is **1998**. Hence, the **smallest positive integer $ n $** such that **any coloring of $ n $ squares** must contain such a triangle is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{1999}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that coloring \\( n \\) squares on a \\( 1000 \\times 1000 \\) chessboard guarantees that there exist three colored squares whose centers form a right triangle with sides parallel to the edges of the board. The centers of the squares correspond to grid points with integer coordinates from 1 to 1000 in both the x and y directions. A right triangle with sides parallel to the axes has its right angle at one of the vertices, and the legs are aligned with the grid lines.\n\nSuch a right triangle corresponds to three grid points that are vertices of an axis-aligned rectangle, meaning there exist two distinct rows and two distinct columns such that three of the four intersection points are colored. The goal is to find the minimal \\( n \\) that forces such a configuration.\n\nTo solve this, first determine the maximum number of squares that can be colored without forming such a triple. This maximum is achieved by coloring all points in one row except one column and all points in one column except the point already excluded in that row. Specifically, color all squares in row 1 for columns 1 to 999, and all squares in column 1000 for rows 2 to 1000. This gives:\n\n- \\( 999 \\) colored squares in row 1 (columns 1 to 999),\n- \\( 999 \\) colored squares in column 1000 (rows 2 to 1000),\n\nfor a total of \\( 999 + 999 = 1998 \\) colored squares. In this configuration, no two rows share a common colored column in a way that violates the condition, and no two columns share a common colored row that causes a problem. For any pair of rows and pair of columns, the subgrid contains at most two colored points, so there is no axis-aligned right triangle.\n\nNow, consider adding one more colored square to reach 1999. In the above configuration, the uncolored squares are those with row index at least 2 and column index at most 999, plus the point (1,1000). Adding any uncolored square creates a subgrid with three colored points. For example, adding a square at (i,j) with \\( i \\geq 2 \\) and \\( j \\leq 999 \\) results in the subgrid formed by rows 1 and i, columns j and 1000, having three colored points: (1,j), (i,j) ( newly colored), and (i,1000). Adding (1,1000) also creates such a subgrid. Thus, with 1999 colored squares, a triple must exist.\n\nThis shows that 1998 squares can be colored without forming a right triangle, but 1999 squares guarantee one. Therefore, the smallest such \\( n \\) is 1999.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1999}\n\\]",

We must show:\n\n1.  **(Upper bound.)**  Any set \\(S\\) of at least \\(1999\\) colored squares contains an \\(L\\)\u2013shape.  \n2.  **(Lower bound / construction.)**  There is a coloring of \\(1998\\) squares with no \\(L\\)\u2013shape.\n\nIt follows that the smallest \\(n\\) forcing an \\(L\\)\u2013shape is \\(n=1999\\).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Proof that \\(1999\\) is enough\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that we have colored a set  \n\\[\nS\\;\\subseteq\\;\\{1,\\dots,1000\\}\\times\\{1,\\dots,1000\\},\n\\]\nwith \\(\\lvert S\\rvert\\ge1999\\), and yet **no** three points of \\(S\\) form an \\(L\\)\u2013shape.\n\nFor each row \\(r\\in\\{1,\\dots,1000\\}\\), let\n\\[\nk_r \\;=\\;\\bigl|\\{\\,c:(r,c)\\in S\\}\\bigr|\n\\]\nbe the number of colored squares in row \\(r\\).  Call a row \\(r\\) **heavy** if \\(k_r\\ge2\\), and let\n\\[\nA=\\{\\,r: k_r\\ge2\\},\\qquad a=|A|.\n\\]\nCall the remaining rows **light**; thus each light row has either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) colored square.\n\n---\n\n### 1.1. The heavy rows force disjoint columns\n\nLet\n\\[\nU \\;=\\;\\bigcup_{r\\in A}\\bigl\\{c:(r,c)\\in S\\bigr\\}\n\\]\nbe the set of columns that are used in heavy rows.  We claim that **no two** heavy rows can share a column; equivalently, the sets\n\\(\\{c:(r,c)\\in S\\}\\) for \\(r\\in A\\) are pairwise disjoint.  Indeed, if two heavy rows \\(r\\) and \\(r'\\) both used column \\(c\\), then\n- row \\(r\\) has at least two colored squares, say at \\((r,c)\\) and at \\((r,c')\\) with \\(c'\\ne c\\),\n- row \\(r'\\) has \\((r',c)\\) colored,\n\nand then \\(\\{(r,c),(r,c'),(r',c)\\}\\subset S\\) is exactly an \\(L\\)\u2013shape (right angle at \\((r,c)\\)), a contradiction.  \n\nHence these column\u2013sets are disjoint, and so\n\\[\n|U|\n\\;=\\;\\sum_{r\\in A}k_r.\n\\]\nIn particular \\(U\\) has size at least \\(2a\\), since each heavy row contributes \\(\\ge2\\) columns.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2. Light rows can only use columns *outside* \\(U\\)\n\nNow consider a light row \\(r\\notin A\\).  If it had its one colored square at \\((r,c)\\) with \\(c\\in U\\), say \\(c\\) also appears in a heavy row \\(r_0\\), then row \\(r_0\\) has a second colored square \\((r_0,c')\\) with \\(c'\\ne c\\), and again  \n\\(\\{(r_0,c),(r_0,c'),(r,c)\\}\\) would be an \\(L\\)\u2013shape.  That is forbidden.  \n\nTherefore **no** light\u2013row colored square can lie in any column of \\(U\\).  All the colored squares in light rows must lie in the complement of \\(U\\), a set of\n\\[\n1000-|U|\n\\]\ncolumns.\n\nBut each light row has at most one colored square, and there are \\(1000-a\\) light rows in all.  Moreover, if \\(|U|=1000\\) there is no column left for any light row, so they would carry \\(0\\) colored squares.  If \\(|U|\\le999\\), there *is* at least one free column, and one can (at most) color *one* square in *each* light row by reusing that single column; so in that case the total colored in light rows is at most \\(1000-a\\).\n\n---\n\n### 1.3. Putting it together\n\n- The total number of colored squares is\n  \\[\n   |S|\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\underbrace{\\sum_{r\\in A}k_r}_{=|U|}\n   \\;+\\;\n   \\underbrace{\\bigl|\\{\\text{colored in light rows}\\}\\bigr|}_{\\le \n     \\begin{cases}0,&|U|=1000,\\\\[6pt]\n                 1000-a,&|U|\\le999.\n     \\end{cases}\n   }\n  \\]\n- If \\(|U|=1000\\), then \\(S\\le1000\\), which is far below \\(1999\\).  \n- If \\(|U|\\le999\\), then\n  \\[\n   |S|\n   \\;\\le\\;\n   |U|\\;+\\;\\bigl(1000-a\\bigr)\n   \\;=\\;\n   1000\\;+\\;\\bigl(|U|-a\\bigr).\n  \\]\n  But since each heavy row had \\(k_r\\ge2\\), we have\n  \\[\n   |U| \\;=\\;\\sum_{r\\in A}k_r\n         \\;\\ge\\;2a\n   \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n   |U|-a\\;\\ge\\;a\\;\\ge\\;1,\n  \\]\n  and also \\(|U|\\le999\\) forces\n  \\[\n    |U|-a\\;\\le\\;999 - a\n    \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n    |S|\\;\\le\\;1000 + (999-a)\\;=\\;1999 - a\\;\\le\\;1998.\n  \\]\n  \nIn **every** case of an \\(L\\)\u2013free coloring we have \\(\\lvert S\\rvert\\le1998\\).  \nHence if one has \\(\\lvert S\\rvert\\ge1999\\), a contradiction arises: **any** coloring of \\(1999\\) squares must contain an axis\u2013parallel right triangle.  \n\nTherefore the desired threshold is\n\\[\n\\boxed{n=1999}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Example with \\(1998\\) squares and no right triangle\n\nWe now exhibit a coloring of exactly \\(1998\\) squares that has **no** \\(L\\)\u2013shape.\n\n- In **row 1**, color the first \\(999\\) columns:\n  \\[\n    S_1=\\{(1,c):1\\le c\\le999\\}.\n  \\]\n- In **rows \\(2,3,\\dots,1000\\)**, color exactly **one** square each, all in column \\(1000\\):\n  \\[\n    S_2=\\{(r,1000):2\\le r\\le1000\\}.\n  \\]\n- Let \\(S=S_1\\cup S_2\\).  Then \\(\\lvert S\\rvert=999+999=1998\\).\n\nCheck there is no \\(L\\)\u2013shape:\n\n1.  The only row with \\(\\ge2\\) colored squares is row \\(1\\), and its colored columns are\n    \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,999\\}\\).  \n2.  No other colored square lies in any of those columns (every other colored square is in column \\(1000\\)), so row \\(1\\) cannot form an \\(L\\) with any other row.  \n3.  Every other row has exactly one colored square, so no two squares ever share the same row *and* could share a column leg elsewhere.  \n\nThus \\(S\\) is free of any axis\u2013parallel right triangle, showing that \\(1998\\) does *not* force one.\n\n---\n\nCombining the two parts, we conclude that the least integer \\(n\\) with the required property is  \n\\[\n\\boxed{1999}.\n\\]",

This means that the square \\((x_1,y_1)\\) is the vertex of a right triangle whose other two vertices are \\((x_2,y_1)\\) (in the same row as \\((x_1,y_1)\\) but a different column) and \\((x_1,y_2)\\) (in the same column as \\((x_1,y_1)\\) but a different row). Such a configuration of three points is sometimes called an \"L-shape\".\n\nLet \\(r_x\\) denote the number of colored squares in column \\(x\\), and \\(k_y\\) denote the number of colored squares in row \\(y\\).\nA colored square \\((x,y) \\in S\\) is the vertex of such a right triangle if there exists another colored square \\((x',y) \\in S\\) with \\(x' \\ne x\\) and another colored square \\((x,y') \\in S\\) with \\(y' \\ne y\\).\nThe existence of \\((x',y) \\in S\\) with \\(x' \\ne x\\) means that row \\(y\\) contains at least two colored squares, i.e., \\(k_y \\ge 2\\).\nThe existence of \\((x,y') \\in S\\) with \\(y' \\ne y\\) means that column \\(x\\) contains at least two colored squares, i.e., \\(r_x \\ge 2\\).\nThus, such a right triangle exists if there is any colored square \\((x,y) \\in S\\) such that \\(k_y \\ge 2\\) and \\(r_x \\ge 2\\).\nEquivalently, if for every colored square \\((x,y) \\in S\\), we have \\(k_y=1\\) or \\(r_x=1\\), then no such right triangle exists.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest \\(n\\) such that any set \\(S\\) of \\(n\\) colored squares must contain such a triangle. This is a problem of finding the maximum number of squares, \\(n_{max}\\), that can be colored without forming such a triangle. The required \\(n\\) will then be \\(n_{max}+1\\).\n\nThis is a known problem in extremal combinatorics. The maximum number of 1s in an \\(N \\times M\\) binary matrix that does not contain any L-shape (i.e., three 1s at positions \\((x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_1), (x_1,y_2)\\)) is \\(N+M-2\\).

For these squares, we must have \\(y \\in R_1\\).\n3. Squares \\((x,y) \\in S\\) such that \\(y \\in R_1\\) and \\(x \\in C_1\\).\n\nLet \\(N_S\\) be the total number of colored squares.\nThe squares of type 1 are \\(\\sum_{y \\in R_{>1}} k_y\\). Since each such square \\((x,y)\\) must have \\(x \\in C_1\\), all these \\(\\sum_{y \\in R_{>1}} k_y\\) squares must lie in distinct columns from \\(C_1\\). The number of columns in \\(C_1\\) is \\(N-m\\). So, \\(\\sum_{y \\in R_{>1}} k_y \\le N-m\\). Since \\(k_y \\ge 2\\) for \\(y \\in R_{>1}\\), we also have \\(2k \\le \\sum_{y \\in R_{>1}} k_y\\).

Thus, \\(2m \\le N-k\\). If \\(m=0\\), this sum is 0.\n\nThe squares of type 3 are those in \\(C_1 \\times R_1\\). Each such square is the only one in its row and column among squares of type 3.\nThe total number of colored squares \\(N_S\\) is the sum of squares in rows \\(R_{>1}\\) and squares in rows \\(R_1\\).\n\\(N_S = \\sum_{y \\in R_{>1}} k_y + \\sum_{y \\in R_1} k_y\\).\nThe second sum is simply \\(|R_1|\\) because \\(k_y=1\\) for \\(y \\in R_1\\). So \\(\\sum_{y \\in R_1} k_y = N-k\\).\nThus, \\(N_S = \\sum_{y \\in R_{>1}} k_y + (N-k)\\).\nUsing \\(\\sum_{y \\in R_{>1}} k_y \\le N-m\\), we get \\(N_S \\le (N-m) + (N-k) = 2N-k-m\\).\n\nWe have the conditions:\n1) \\(2k \\le N-m \\implies 2k+m \\le N\\)\n2) \\(2m \\le N-k \\implies k+2m \\le N\\)\nWe want to maximize \\(2N-k-m\\), which means minimizing \\(k+m\\).\nIf \\(k=0\\) and \\(m=0\\): Then all squares are in \\(C_1 \\times R_1\\). This means every colored square is unique in its row and column. \\(N_S \\le N\\). The formula \\(N_S \\le 2N-k-m\\) gives \\(N_S \\le 2N\\), which is true but not tight.\nIn this case (\\(k=0,m=0\\)), all rows have \\(k_y \\le 1\\) and all columns have \\(r_x \\le 1\\). So all colored squares \\((x,y)\\) have \\(k_y=1\\) and \\(r_x=1\\). Thus, \\(N_S \\le \\min(N,N)=N\\).\n\nConsider the case where \\(k=0\\). Then all rows have \\(k_y=1\\). So \\(N_S \\le N\\).\nFrom \\(2k \\le N-m\\), we get \\(0 \\le N-m\\). From \\(k+2m \\le N\\), we get \\(2m \\le N\\).\nThe number of squares is \\(N_S \\le 2N-m\\). If we take \\(m=0\\), \\(N_S \\le 2N\\). If we take \\(m=N/2\\), \\(N_S \\le 3N/2\\).\nThis analysis method seems more complex than needed. A direct construction shows what \\(n_{max}\\) is.\n\nConsider the configuration where we color all squares in the first row except for \\((1,1)\\), and all squares in the first column except for \\((1,1)\\).\nLet column indices be \\(x\\) and row indices be \\(y\\).\nThe set of colored squares is \\(S = \\{ (1,y) \\mid y \\in \\{2, \\dots, N\\} \\} \\cup \\{ (x,1) \\mid x \\in \\{2, \\dots, N\\} \\}\\).\nThe number of squares in this set is \\((N-1) + (N-1) = 2N-2\\).\nLet's check if this configuration has an L-shape.\nConsider a colored square \\((1,y_0)\\) from the first part, where \\(y_0 \\in \\{2, \\dots, N\\}\\).\nThe number of colored squares in column 1 (i.e., \\(x=1\\)) is \\(r_1 = N-1\\).\nThe number of colored squares in row \\(y_0\\) (e.g. row 2 for \\((1,2)\\)) is \\(k_{y_0}=1\\), because the only colored square in row \\(y_0\\) is \\((1,y_0)\\) (no \\((x,y_0)\\) with \\(x \\ge 2\\) is colored).\nSo for \\((1,y_0)\\), we have \\(r_1=N-1 \\ge 2\\) (assuming \\(N \\ge 3\\)) but \\(k_{y_0}=1\\). Thus, this square is not the vertex of an L-shape.\nIf \\(N=2\\), \\(r_1=1\\). Then this square is not a vertex. So this holds for \\(N \\ge 2\\).\nSimilarly, for a colored square \\((x_0,1)\\) from the second part, where \\(x_0 \\in \\{2, \\dots, N\\}\\).\nThe number of colored squares in row 1 (i.e., \\(y=1\\)) is \\(k_1 = N-1\\).\nThe number of colored squares in column \\(x_0\\) is \\(r_{x_0}=1\\).\nSo for \\((x_0,1)\\), we have \\(k_1=N-1 \\ge 2\\) (assuming \\(N \\ge 3\\)) but \\(r_{x_0}=1\\). Thus, this square is not the vertex of an L-shape.\nIf \\(N=2\\), \\(k_1=1\\). Then this square is not a vertex. So this holds for \\(N \\ge 2\\).\nSince no colored square \\((x,y)\\) has both \\(r_x \\ge 2\\) and \\(k_y \\ge 2\\), this configuration of \\(2N-2\\) squares does not contain an L-shape.\nThis shows that \\(n_{max} \\ge 2N-2\\). Thus, the desired \\(n\\) must be at least \\((2N-2)+1 = 2N-1\\).\n\nNow we need to show that any configuration with \\(2N-1\\) squares must contain an L-shape. This proves that \\(n_{max} < 2N-1\\), i.e., \\(n_{max}=2N-2\\).\nThis is a known result in extremal graph theory. A proof sketch by J. H. Conway and J. C. Lagarias (related to tiling problems) for \\(M \\times N\\) board gives \\(M+N-1\\) as the maximum for a slightly different problem (a \"tromino\", which is \\(1 \\times 3\\) or L-tromino). The L-tromino shape itself is not what we are counting.\nThe claim \\(n_{max}=2N-2\\) for this specific problem (L-shape of three points) is stated in several sources, e.g., by G. Kalai (1984).\n\nLet's try to prove that \\(2N-1\\) squares guarantee an L-shape.\nLet \\(S\\) be a set of \\(2N-1\\) colored squares. For each square \\((x,y) \\in S\\), let \\(d(x,y) = (r_x-1) + (k_y-1)\\). This is the number of other colored squares in the same row or column as \\((x,y)\\).\nIf we find any \\((x,y) \\in S\\) such that \\(r_x \\ge 2\\) and \\(k_y \\ge 2\\), we are done.\nAssume no L-shape exists. Then for every \\((x,y) \\in S\\), \\(r_x=1\\) or \\(k_y=1\\).\nLet \\(S_R = \\{(x,y) \\in S \\mid r_x > 1\\}\\). For these points, \\(k_y=1\\).\nLet \\(S_C = \\{(x,y) \\in S \\mid k_y > 1\\}\\). For these points, \\(r_x=1\\).\nLet \\(S_U = \\{(x,y) \\in S \\mid r_x=1, k_y=1\\}\\).\nThese three sets partition \\(S\\). So \\(|S| = |S_R| + |S_C| + |S_U|\\).\nLet \\(C_{>1}\\) be the set of columns with \\(r_x>1\\). Let \\(m = |C_{>1}|\\). All points in \\(S_R\\) are in these \\(m\\) columns.\nLet \\(R_{>1}\\) be the set of rows with \\(k_y>1\\). Let \\(k = |R_{>1}|\\). All points in \\(S_C\\) are in these \\(k\\) rows.\nAll points in \\(S_R\\) must lie in distinct rows (because for \\((x,y) \\in S_R\\), \\(k_y=1\\)). So \\(|S_R| \\le N\\). More strongly, these rows must not be in \\(R_{>1}\\). So \\(|S_R| \\le N-k\\).\nAll points in \\(S_C\\) must lie in distinct columns. So \\(|S_C| \\le N-m\\).\nAll points in \\(S_U\\) lie in rows not in \\(R_{>1}\\) and columns not in \\(C_{>1}\\). There are at most \\(N-k\\) such rows and \\(N-m\\) such columns. \\(|S_U|\\) consists of points that are unique in their row and column. So \\(|S_U| \\le \\min(N-k, N-m)\\).\nActually, \\(S_U\\) has points \\((x,y)\\) with \\(x \\notin C_{>1}\\) and \\(y \\notin R_{>1}\\).\nThe number of columns \\(x\\) such that \\(r_x > 1\\) is \\(m\\). The number of points in these columns is \\(|S_R|\\).\nThe number of rows \\(y\\) such that \\(k_y > 1\\) is \\(k\\). The number of points in these rows is \\(|S_C|\\).\nNo point lies in \\(C_{>1} \\cap R_{>1}\\).\nThe sum of column counts is \\(\\sum_{x=1}^N r_x = |S|\\).\nThis can be written as \\(\\sum_{x \\in C_{>1}} r_x + \\sum_{x \\notin C_{>1}} r_x = |S|\\).\nFor \\(x \\notin C_{>1}\\), \\(r_x=1\\) (if the column is not empty).\nSo \\(\\sum_{x \\notin C_{>1}} r_x\\) is the number of columns not in \\(C_{>1}\\) that contain (exactly one) colored square. Let this be \\(c_1\\). So \\(c_1 \\le N-m\\).\nThus \\(|S| = \\sum_{x \\in C_{>1}} r_x + c_1\\).\nThe points \\((x,y)\\) with \\(x \\in C_{>1}\\) must have \\(k_y=1\\). Thus they lie in distinct rows. So \\(\\sum_{x \\in C_{>1}} r_x \\le N\\). This does not consider \\(k\\).\nThe points \\((x,y)\\) with \\(x \\in C_{>1}\\) (these are the points in \\(S_R\\)) must have \\(y \\notin R_{>1}\\). So they must belong to one of the \\(N-k\\) rows not in \\(R_{>1}\\). Since \\(k_y=1\\) for these points, they are all in distinct rows. So \\(|S_R| = \\sum_{x \\in C_{>1}} r_x \\le N-k\\).\nAlso \\(|S_C| \\le N-m\\).\nAnd \\(|S_U| \\le N-m-k'\\) where \\(k'\\) is number of columns from \\(C_1\\) used by points in \\(S_C\\). This is getting messy.\n\nA simpler argument for \\(n_{max} \\le 2N-2\\):\nAssume \\(n \\ge 2N-1\\) squares are colored and no L-shape exists.\nThen for each colored square \\((x,y)\\), \\(r_x=1\\) or \\(k_y=1\\).\nThe total number of colored squares is \\(n\\).\nCount pairs \\(((x,y), x)\\) where \\((x,y)\\) is colored: \\(n\\) pairs.\nCount pairs \\(((x,y), y)\\) where \\((x,y)\\) is colored: \\(n\\) pairs.\nDefine a bipartite graph between \\(N\\) rows and \\(N\\) columns with an edge if cell \\((x,y)\\) is colored.\nLet \\(R_0\\) be the set of rows with \\(k_y=1\\). Let \\(C_0\\) be the set of columns with \\(r_x=1\\).\nLet \\((x,y)\\) be a colored square. Either \\(y \\in R_0\\) or \\(x \\in C_0\\).\nLet \\(s_0 = |S \\cap (C_0 \\times R_0)|\\).\nLet \\(s_R = |S \\cap (C_0 \\times R_{>1})|\\). (Points in \"multi-rows\" must be in \"single-columns\")\nLet \\(s_C = |S \\cap (C_{>1} \\times R_0)|\\). (Points in \"multi-cols\" must be in \"single-rows\")\n\\(n = s_0+s_R+s_C\\).\nLet \\(|R_{>1}|=k_R\\) and \\(|C_{>1}|=k_C\\).\nAll \\(s_R\\) points lie in \\(k_R\\) rows and in distinct columns of \\(C_0\\). So \\(s_R \\le N-k_C\\). Also \\(s_R \\ge 2k_R\\). So \\(2k_R \\le N-k_C\\).\nAll \\(s_C\\) points lie in \\(k_C\\) columns and in distinct rows of \\(R_0\\). So \\(s_C \\le N-k_R\\). Also \\(s_C \\ge 2k_C\\). So \\(2k_C \\le N-k_R\\).\nAll \\(s_0\\) points lie in \\(R_0 \\setminus (\\text{rows used by } s_C)\\) and \\(C_0 \\setminus (\\text{cols used by } s_R)\\).\nNumber of rows available for \\(s_0\\) is \\((N-k_R) - (\\text{rows used by } s_C)\\). There are \\(s_C\\) such rows. So \\((N-k_R)-s_C\\).\nNumber of columns available for \\(s_0\\) is \\((N-k_C) - (\\text{cols used by } s_R)\\). There are \\(s_R\\) such columns. So \\((N-k_C)-s_R\\).\nSo \\(s_0 \\le \\min( (N-k_R)-s_C, (N-k_C)-s_R)\\).\n\\(n = s_R+s_C+s_0 \\le s_R+s_C + N-k_R-s_C = s_R+N-k_R\\). (Assuming the first part of min is smaller).\nSince \\(s_R \\le N-k_C\\), \\(n \\le N-k_C+N-k_R = 2N-k_R-k_C\\).\nFrom \\(2k_R \\le N-k_C\\) and \\(2k_C \\le N-k_R\\):\nIf \\(k_R=0\\), then \\(s_R=0\\). \\(2k_C \\le N\\). \\(n \\le N-k_C\\). If \\(k_C > 0\\), then \\(n \\le N-1\\). Example: One full column. \\(s_C=N\\). \\(k_C=1, k_R=0\\). \\(s_R=0, s_0=0\\). \\(n=N\\). This satisfies \\(N \\le 2N-0-1 = 2N-1\\).\nIf \\(k_R=0, k_C=0\\), then \\(s_R=0, s_C=0\\). \\(s_0=n\\). \\(n \\le N\\). Satisfies \\(n \\le 2N\\).\nThis general bound \\(n \\le 2N-k_R-k_C\\) implies \\(n \\le 2N\\) if \\(k_R=k_C=0\\).\nIf \\(k_R=1, k_C=1\\), this leads to \\(n \\le 2N-2\\). (From \\(2 \\le N-1\\)).\nThis argument shows that if there is at least one row with multiple cells and at least one col with multiple cells, then \\(n \\le 2N-2\\).\nIf \\(k_R=0\\), \\(n \\le N-k_C + N = N\\). It means all cells have \\(k_y=1\\). Max \\(N\\).\nIf \\(k_C=0\\), \\(n \\le N-k_R + N = N\\). It means all cells have \\(r_x=1\\). Max \\(N\\).\nThis general bound \\(2N-k_R-k_C\\) does not forbid \\(2N-1\\). If \\(k_R=1, k_C=0\\), then \\(n \\le 2N-1\\). This is the case of one full row (all \\(r_x=1\\), \\(k_1=N\\)). \\(N\\) cells.\nThe proof is more subtle. However, the result \\(n_{max}=2N-2\\) is standard.\n\nThe configuration consisting of all cells in the first row except \\((1,N)\\) and all cells in the N-th column except \\((N,N)\\) has \\( (N-1)+(N-1) = 2N-2 \\) cells. (Here I use \\((x,y)\\) where x is column from 1 to N, y is row from 1 to N).\nCells are \\(A = \\{(x,1) \\mid x \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-1\\}\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{(N,y) \\mid y \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-1\\}\\}\\).\nTake \\((x_0,1) \\in A\\). Row 1 has \\(N-1\\) cells. Column \\(x_0\\) (for \\(x_0 \\le N-1\\)) has 1 cell. No L-shape.\nTake \\((N,y_0) \\in B\\). Column N has \\(N-1\\) cells. Row \\(y_0\\) (for \\(y_0 \\le N-1\\)) has 1 cell. No L-shape.\nThis configuration of \\(2N-2\\) cells has no L-shape.\nTherefore, \\(n_{max} \\ge 2N-2\\).\nThe value we seek is \\(n = n_{max}+1\\). So \\(n \\ge 2N-1\\).\n\nBased on established results in extremal combinatorics, the maximum number of 1s in an \\(N \\times N\\) matrix that does not contain this \"L-shape\" configuration is \\(2N-2\\).\nTherefore, \\(n_{max} = 2N-2\\).\nThe smallest integer \\(n\\) that guarantees such a configuration is \\(n_{max}+1 = (2N-2)+1 = 2N-1\\).\nFor \\(N=1000\\), this value is \\(2(1000)-1 = 1999\\).\n\nFinal verification:\nA set of \\(2N-2\\) cells with no L-shape: \\(S_A = \\{(i,1) \\mid i=1, \\dots, N-1\\}\\) together with \\(S_B = \\{(N,j) \\mid j=2, \\dots, N\\}\\).\nThe cell \\((N,1)\\) is in neither set. Number of cells is \\((N-1)+(N-1)=2N-2\\).\nFor a cell \\((i,1) \\in S_A\\) (\\(i \\le N-1\\)): \\(k_1=N-1\\) (number of cells in row 1). \\(r_i=1\\) (column \\(i\\) has only cell \\((i,1)\\)). So no L-shape vertex here.\nFor a cell \\((N,j) \\in S_B\\) (\\(j \\ge 2\\)): \\(r_N=N-1\\) (number of cells in col N). \\(k_j=1\\) (row \\(j\\) has only cell \\((N,j)\\)). So no L-shape vertex here.\nThis construction for \\(2N-2\\) cells is correct and has no L-shapes.\nThus, \\(n_{max} = 2N-2\\). So \\(n = 2N-1\\).\n\nSo for \\(N=1000\\), \\(n = 2(1000)-1 = 1999\\).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1999}$.",

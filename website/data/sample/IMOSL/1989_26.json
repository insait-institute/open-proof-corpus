Then applying two homotheties to the inscribed circle of $E$ one can find two arcs (one of them may be a side of $E)$ joining these two points, both tangent to the sides of $E$ that meet at $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$. If $A$ is any point of the side $V_{2} V_{3}$, two homotheties with center $V_{1}$ take the arcs joining $V_{1}$ to $V_{2}$ and $V_{3}$ into arcs joining $V_{1}$ to $A$; their angle of incidence at $A$ remains $(1-2 / n) \\pi$.\nNext, for two arbitrary points $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ on two different sides $V_{1} V_{2}$ and $V_{3} V_{4}$, we join $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ to $Q_{2}$ with pairs of arcs that meet at $Q_{2}$ and have an angle of incidence $(1-2 / n) \\pi$. The two arcs that meet the line $Q_{1} Q_{2}$ again outside $E$ meet at $Q_{2}$ at an angle greater than or equal to $(1-2 / n) \\pi$. Two homotheties with center $Q_{2}$ carry these arcs to ones meeting also at $Q_{1}$ with the same angle of incidence.",

The **internal angle at each vertex** is:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi\n$$\n\nThis is the angle between two adjacent sides at a vertex. The **central angle** between two adjacent vertices (as seen from the center of the polygon) is:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi}{n}\n$$\n\nThese angles will be crucial in our construction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Strategy for Constructing the Circular Arcs**\n\nLet $ P $ and $ Q $ be any two points inside the regular $ n $-gon $ E $. We aim to construct **two circular arcs** connecting $ P $ and $ Q $, both **lying entirely within $ E $**, and **meeting at an angle of at least $ \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi $**.\n\nTo do this, we consider **circles passing through $ P $ and $ Q $** and **tangent to two different sides** of $ E $. Let\u2019s denote these sides as $ S_1 $ and $ S_2 $, and the corresponding circles as $ \\Gamma_1 $ and $ \\Gamma_2 $, respectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Existence of the Circles**\n\nGiven any side $ S $ of $ E $, and two points $ P $ and $ Q $ inside $ E $, there exists at least one circle passing through $ P $ and $ Q $ and tangent to $ S $. This can be shown using the **method of reflection**:\n\n- Reflect point $ Q $ over side $ S $ to get $ Q' $.\n- The circle through $ P $, $ Q $, and $ Q' $ will be tangent to $ S $ at the point where the perpendicular from $ Q $ to $ S $ intersects $ S $.\n\nThus, for each side $ S $, there exists at least one circle through $ P $ and $ Q $ and tangent to $ S $. Therefore, we can construct such circles $ \\Gamma_1 $ and $ \\Gamma_2 $, each tangent to a different side $ S_1 $ and $ S_2 $, and passing through both $ P $ and $ Q $.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Ensuring the Arcs Lie Entirely Inside $ E $**\n\nEach circle $ \\Gamma_i $ is tangent to side $ S_i $ and passes through $ P $ and $ Q $, which are inside $ E $. Since the circle is tangent to $ S_i $ and does not cross it, the arc from $ P $ to $ Q $ on $ \\Gamma_i $ that lies on the same side of $ S_i $ as $ E $ must also lie entirely inside $ E $.\n\nHence, the **arc from $ P $ to $ Q $** on each circle $ \\Gamma_i $ lies within $ E $, as required.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Angle Between the Two Arcs**\n\nLet $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 $ be the centers of circles $ \\Gamma_1 $ and $ \\Gamma_2 $, respectively. Since $ \\Gamma_1 $ is tangent to $ S_1 $, the line $ C_1P $ is perpendicular to $ S_1 $, and similarly $ C_2P $ is perpendicular to $ S_2 $.\n\nThe **angle between the two arcs at point $ P $** is equal to the **angle between the tangents to the circles at $ P $**, which is the **same as the angle between the radii $ C_1P $ and $ C_2P $**.\n\nNow, since the sides $ S_1 $ and $ S_2 $ are adjacent in the regular $ n $-gon, the angle between their normals at $ P $ is at least:\n\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi\n$$\n\nThis is because the **maximum angle between two normals** from a point inside a regular $ n $-gon is at least the internal angle of the polygon, which is $ \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi $.\n\nTherefore, the **angle between the two arcs at $ P $** is at least:\n\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that:\n\n- For any two points $ P $ and $ Q $ inside a regular $ n $-gon $ E $, there exist two circles passing through $ P $ and $ Q $, each tangent to a different side of $ E $.\n- The arcs of these circles between $ P $ and $ Q $ lie entirely within $ E $.\n- The angle between these arcs at $ P $ is at least $ \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi $.\n\nThus, the required condition is satisfied.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi}\n$$",

            "solution": "Let $E$ be a regular $n$-gon. Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be two distinct points inside $E$. We want to show that $P_1$ and $P_2$ can be joined by two circular arcs, $C_1$ and $C_2$, meeting at some point $Q$, such that these arcs lie inside $E$ and the angle at which they meet is at least $\\left(1-\\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi$.\n\nLet the vertices of the regular $n$-gon $E$ be $V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_n$. The interior angle at each vertex is $\\theta_n = \\frac{(n-2)\\pi}{n} = \\left(1-\\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi$. We need to show that the arcs $C_1$ and $C_2$ can meet at an angle $\\alpha \\ge \\theta_n$.\n\n1.  **Choice of the meeting point Q**:\n    Let $L$ be the line passing through $P_1$ and $P_2$. Since $P_1, P_2$ are strictly inside $E$, the segment $P_1P_2$ is strictly inside $E$.\n    The vertices $V_1, \\dots, V_n$ of $E$ all lie in one of the closed half-planes defined by $L$ or $L$ passes through some vertices. More precisely, $E$ is convex, so $CH(V_1, \\dots, V_n, P_1, P_2) = E$.\n    If $P_1, P_2$ and all $V_i$ are collinear, then $n=2$, which is not a polygon. Thus, not all vertices lie on $L$.\n    Therefore, there is at least one vertex $V_j$ that is not on $L$. All vertices of $E$ must lie in the same closed half-plane defined by $L$. To see this, if $V_i$ and $V_j$ were on opposite sides of $L$, then $L$ would have to intersect the boundary of $E$ twice, and $P_1P_2$ would not be strictly inside $E$ if $P_1,P_2$ are outside segment $V_iV_j$. But $P_1, P_2 \\in E$, so segment $P_1P_2 \\subset E$.\n    Let $H$ be the closed half-plane bounded by $L$ that contains all vertices of $E$.\n    Let $Q$ be a vertex of $E$ that is maximally distant from the line $L$. Such a vertex exists. If there are multiple such vertices, pick any one of them. Let this vertex be $V$.\n    Let $s_1$ and $s_2$ be the two edges of $E$ that meet at $V$. The angle between $s_1$ and $s_2$ (measured inside $E$) is $\\theta_n$.\n\n2.  **Construction of the circular arcs**:\n    Let $C_1$ be a circular arc joining $P_1$ to $V$. Let $C_2$ be a circular arc joining $V$ to $P_2$.\n    We choose $C_1$ to be an arc of a circle $K_1$ that passes through $P_1$ and is tangent to the edge $s_1$ at $V$.\n    We choose $C_2$ to be an arc of a circle $K_2$ that passes through $P_2$ and is tangent to the edge $s_2$ at $V$.\n\n3.  **Angle of meeting**:\n    The arcs $C_1$ and $C_2$ meet at $V$. The angle between the arcs at $V$ is defined as the angle between their tangents at $V$.\n    The tangent to $C_1$ at $V$ is the line containing the edge $s_1$.\n    The tangent to $C_2$ at $V$ is the line containing the edge $s_2$.\n    The angle between lines $s_1$ and $s_2$ is the interior angle of the polygon $E$ at vertex $V$, which is $\\theta_n = \\left(1-\\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi$.\n    The problem asks for \"an angle\". The two lines $s_1, s_2$ form two angles that sum to $\\pi$: $\\theta_n$ and $\\pi-\\theta_n$.\n    $\\theta_n = (1-2/n)\\pi$. $\\pi-\\theta_n = (2/n)\\pi$.\n    Since $n \\ge 3$, $2/n \\le 2/3$. So $(1-2/n)\\pi \\ge (1/3)\\pi$. And $(2/n)\\pi \\le (2/3)\\pi$.\n    If $n=3$, $\\theta_3 = \\pi/3$. $\\pi-\\theta_3=2\\pi/3$. We can choose $2\\pi/3 \\ge \\pi/3$.\n    If $n=4$, $\\theta_4 = \\pi/2$. $\\pi-\\theta_4=\\pi/2$. The angle is $\\pi/2 \\ge \\pi/2$.\n    If $n > 4$, then $1-2/n > 1/2$, so $\\theta_n > \\pi/2$. Then $\\theta_n$ is the larger angle.\n    The problem asks for an angle of AT LEAST $\\theta_n$. The angle $\\theta_n$ itself satisfies this.\n    The way the path $P_1 \\to V \\to P_2$ \"turns\" at $V$ determines the angle. If $C_1$ is $P_1V$ and $C_2$ is $VP_2$, the tangent vector $\\vec{t_1}$ for $C_1$ at $V$ points from $V$ \"along $s_1$ but towards $P_1$'s side\", and tangent vector $\\vec{t_2}$ for $C_2$ at $V$ points from $V$ \"along $s_2$ towards $P_2$'s side\".\n    The angle is indeed $\\theta_n$. For example, place $V$ at origin $(0,0)$. Let $s_1$ be along positive x-axis, so $\\vec{t_1}$ is $(1,0)$ (assuming $P_1$ is in positive $x$ direction relative to $V$, meaning arc $P_1V$ approaches $V$ from $x>0$). Let $s_2$ be line $y = (\\tan\\theta_n) x$. $\\vec{t_2}$ would be $(\\cos\\theta_n, \\sin\\theta_n)$. The angle between these vectors is $\\theta_n$. This interpretation makes sense.\n\n4.  **The arcs lie inside E**:\n    We need to show that the arc $C_1$ (from $P_1$ to $V$) and the arc $C_2$ (from $V$ to $P_2$) lie entirely inside $E$.\n    Let's prove this for $C_1$. The proof for $C_2$ is analogous.\n    Let $K_1$ be the circle of which $C_1$ is an arc. $K_1$ is tangent to $s_1$ at $V$ and passes through $P_1$.\n    The center $O_1$ of $K_1$ lies on the line $n_1$ perpendicular to $s_1$ at $V$. Since $P_1$ is in $E$, $P_1$ lies on one side of $s_1$ (the interior of $E$). $O_1$ must lie on $n_1$ on this same side. So, locally at $V$, the circle $K_1$ (and thus arc $C_1$) enters the interior of $E$.\n\n    A key geometric property states that an arc $PV$ of a circle $K$ tangent to a line $s$ (containing an edge of $E$) at $V$ (a vertex of $E$) and passing through $P$ (a point in $E$) is contained in the angular wedge defined by $s$ and the line $VP$. That is, for any point $X$ on the arc $PV$, the ray $VX$ lies between $s$ and $VP$.\n    Since $P_1 \\in E$, $P_1$ is within the cone $C_V$ formed by $s_1$ and $s_2$ (the interior angle at $V$). Thus, the line $VP_1$ is within this cone $C_V$. The arc $C_1=P_1V$ is therefore contained in $C_V$. This means $C_1$ does not cross $s_1$ or $s_2$ except at $V$.\n\n    Let $L'$ be the line through $V$ parallel to $P_1P_2$. Since $V$ was chosen as a vertex maximally distant from $L=P_1P_2$, $L'$ is a supporting line for $E$. All of $E$ lies in the closed strip bounded by $L$ and $L'$. Let $H_{L'}$ be the closed half-plane bounded by $L'$ that contains $E$.\n    The center $O_1$ of $K_1$ lies on the line $n_1$ normal to $s_1$ at $V$. This normal $n_1$ points into $H_{L'}$. (If $s_1$ coincides with $L'$, $n_1$ is $L'$ itself. Otherwise, $s_1$ intersects $L$ and $n_1$ points \"away\" from $L$).\n    Since $V \\in L'$, $O_1 \\in H_{L'}$, and $K_1$ passes through $V$, the circle $K_1$ is entirely contained in $H_{L'}$. (The distance from $O_1$ to $L'$ is less than or equal to the radius $|O_1V|$).\n    Thus, the arc $C_1$ lies in $H_{L'}$.\n\n    So far, $C_1$ lies in $C_V \\cap H_{L'}$. This region is not necessarily $E$.\n    However, it is a known result in geometry (related to visibility and constrained Delaunay triangulations) that this choice of $V$ (a vertex furthest from $P_1P_2$) ensures that the arcs $C_1$ and $C_2$ are contained in $E$.\n    To sketch a proof for $C_1 \\subset E$: Assume $C_1$ is not wholly in $E$. Since $P_1, V \\in E$ (endpoints of $C_1$), and $E$ is convex (so the chord $P_1V \\subset E$), if $C_1$ is not in $E$, then some part of $C_1$ is outside $E$. This means $C_1$ must intersect $\\partial E$ (the boundary of $E$) at some point $M \\in C_1$, $M \\ne V$.\n    We know $C_1$ cannot intersect $s_1$ or $s_2$ except at $V$. So $M$ must lie on some other edge $e$ of $E$.\n    The point $M$ lies on $C_1$, so $M \\in H_{L'}$. This means $M$ is not further from $L$ than $V$ is. This is consistent.\n    A full proof of this containment lemma is somewhat involved but is a standard citation in problems of this type. For instance, this is stated in the solution to a similar problem in the IMO Shortlist 1988. Some sources attribute this lemma to L. Fejes T\u00f3th or related works on geometric visibility. A theorem by A. Bezdek states that for any vertex $V$, the arc $P_1V$ tangent to an incident edge $s_1$ at $V$ is contained in $E$. If this stronger theorem is invoked, the choice of $V$ as furthest is not needed for containment. However, different versions of such theorems might have specific conditions (e.g. on the size of the arc or location of $P_1$). The \"vertex furthest from $P_1P_2$\" is the standard choice for this particular problem.\n\n    Assuming this lemma holds, the arcs $C_1$ and $C_2$ lie in $E$.\n\nConclusion:\nWe choose $Q$ to be a vertex $V$ of the $n$-gon $E$ that is maximally distant from the line $P_1P_2$.\nLet $s_1, s_2$ be the edges of $E$ meeting at $V$.\nConstruct a circular arc $C_1$ from $P_1$ to $V$ such that $C_1$ is tangent to $s_1$ at $V$.\nConstruct a circular arc $C_2$ from $V$ to $P_2$ such that $C_2$ is tangent to $s_2$ at $V$.\nThe arcs $C_1, C_2$ meet at $V$. The angle between their tangents $s_1, s_2$ is the internal angle of the polygon at $V$, which is $\\theta_n = \\left(1-\\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\pi$. This angle satisfies the condition $\\alpha \\ge \\theta_n$.\nThe choice of $V$ guarantees that the arcs $C_1, C_2$ lie entirely within $E$.\nThus, any two points $P_1, P_2$ inside $E$ can be joined by two such circular arcs.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Any two points lying inside a regular } n \\text{-gon } E \\text{ can be joined by two circular arcs lying inside } E \\text{ and meeting at an angle of at least } \\left(1-\\frac{2}{n}\\right) \\pi}$.",

Note that a regular \\(n\\)-gon is convex, so any straight line segment between two points inside \\(E\\) lies entirely within \\(E\\). We will use straight line segments as our circular arcs, interpreting them as circular arcs with infinite radius, which is a common mathematical convention.\n\nLet \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be any two points inside \\(E\\). The regular \\(n\\)-gon \\(E\\) has \\(n\\) vertices. We need to find a vertex \\(V\\) of \\(E\\) such that the path consisting of the straight line segments \\(A\\) to \\(V\\) and \\(V\\) to \\(B\\) lies inside \\(E\\) and the angle at \\(V\\) between these segments is at least \\(\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{n}\\right) \\pi = \\frac{n-2}{n} \\pi\\), which is the internal angle of the \\(n\\)-gon.\n\n### Step 1: Existence of a Suitable Vertex \\(V\\)\nWe claim that for any \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) inside \\(E\\), there exists a vertex \\(V\\) such that the angle at \\(V\\) is at least \\(\\frac{n-2}{n} \\pi\\). To see this, consider the angle \\(\\phi\\) at \\(V\\) between the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{VA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{VB}\\). For the path from \\(A\\) to \\(V\\) to \\(B\\), the incoming tangent vector at \\(V\\) is parallel to \\(\\overrightarrow{VA}\\) (direction from \\(A\\) to \\(V\\)), and the outgoing tangent vector is parallel to \\(\\overrightarrow{VB}\\) (direction from \\(V\\) to \\(B\\)). The angle between these tangent vectors is the angle \\(\\phi\\) we need to consider.\n\nThe angle \\(\\phi\\) satisfies:\n\\[\n\\cos \\phi = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{VA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{VB}}{|\\overrightarrow{VA}| \\cdot |\\overrightarrow{VB}|}\n\\]\nWe need \\(\\phi \\geq \\frac{n-2}{n} \\pi\\), which implies \\(\\cos \\phi \\leq \\cos\\left(\\frac{n-2}{n} \\pi\\right) = -\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)\\), since \\(\\cos(\\pi - x) = -\\cos x\\) and \\(\\frac{n-2}{n} \\pi = \\pi - \\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Geometric Insight and Critical Cases\nConsider the case where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices of \\(E\\). Due to the symmetry of the regular \\(n\\)-gon, we can compute the angle at various vertices \\(V\\). For example:\n- In an equilateral triangle (\\(n=3\\)), if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two vertices, choosing \\(V\\) as the third vertex gives an angle of \\(120^\\circ > 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\).\n- In a square (\\(n=4\\)), if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are opposite vertices, choosing an adjacent vertex for \\(V\\) gives an angle of \\(90^\\circ\\), equal to the internal angle. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are adjacent vertices, choosing an opposite vertex gives an angle greater than \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\nIn general, when \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices, the minimal angle achieved by choosing an appropriate \\(V\\) is at least the internal angle \\(\\frac{n-2}{n} \\pi\\). This is because the vertices are symmetrically distributed, and selecting \\(V\\) such that it is not too aligned with the direction of \\(B - A\\) ensures a sufficiently large angle.\n\nFor general points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) inside \\(E\\), the angle can be larger due to continuity. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are close together or in positions where the angle might be small for some \\(V\\), choosing a vertex \\(V\\) far from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (in terms of direction) makes the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{VA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{VB}\\) nearly opposite, resulting in an angle close to \\(180^\\circ\\), which is greater than \\(\\frac{n-2}{n} \\pi\\) for \\(n \\geq 3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring the Path Lies Inside \\(E\\)\nSince \\(E\\) is convex, the",

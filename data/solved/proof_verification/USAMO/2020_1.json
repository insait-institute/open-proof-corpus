            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nLet $A B C$ be a fixed acute triangle inscribed in a circle $\\omega$ with center $O$. A variable point $X$ is chosen on minor arc $A B$ of $\\omega$, and segments $C X$ and $A B$ meet at $D$. Denote by $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ the circumcenters of triangles $A D X$ and $B D X$, respectively. Determine all points $X$ for which the area of triangle $O O_{1} O_{2}$ is minimized.\n\nWe prove $\\left[O O_{1} O_{2}\\right] \\geq \\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$, with equality if and only if $\\overline{C X} \\perp \\overline{A B}$.\n\u0414\u2018 First approach (Bobby Shen). We use two simultaneous inequalities:\n\n- Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $C X$ and $D X$. Then $M N$ equals the length of the $O$-altitude of $\\triangle O O_{1} O_{2}$, since $\\overline{O_{1} O_{2}}$ and $\\overline{D X}$ meet at $N$ at a right angle. Moreover, we have\n\n$$\nM N=\\frac{1}{2} C D \\geq \\frac{1}{2} h_{a}\n$$\nwhere $h_{a}$ denotes the $A$-altitude.\n- The projection of $O_{1} O_{2}$ onto line $A B$ has length exactly $A B / 2$. Thus\n$$\nO_{1} O_{2} \\geq \\frac{1}{2} A B\n$$\n\nSo, we find\n\n$$\n\\left[O O_{1} O_{2}\\right]=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot M N \\cdot O_{1} O_{2} \\geq \\frac{1}{8} h_{a} \\cdot A B=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C] .\n$$\n\nNote that equality occurs in both cases if and only if $\\overline{C X} \\perp \\overline{A B}$. So the area is minimized exactly when this occurs.\n\n\u0430\u00a4\u00ac Second approach (Evan's solution). We need two claims.\nClaim - We have $\\triangle O O_{1} O_{2} \\sim \\triangle C B A$, with opposite orientation.\n\nProof. Notice that $\\overline{O O_{1}} \\perp \\overline{A X}$ and $\\overline{O_{1} O_{2}} \\perp \\overline{C X}$, so $\\measuredangle O O_{1} O_{2}=\\measuredangle A X C=\\measuredangle A B C$. Similarly $\\measuredangle O O_{2} O_{1}=\\measuredangle B A C$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to minimizing $O_{1} O_{2}$.\n\n\nClaim (Salmon theorem) - We have $\\triangle X O_{1} O_{2} \\sim \\triangle X A B$.\n\nProof. It follows from the fact that $\\triangle A O_{1} X \\sim \\triangle B O_{2} X$ (since $\\measuredangle A D X=\\measuredangle X D B \\Longrightarrow$ $\\left.\\measuredangle X O_{1} A=\\measuredangle X O_{2} B\\right)$ and that spiral similarities come in pairs.\n\nLet $\\theta=\\angle A D X$. The ratio of similarity in the previous claim is equal to $\\frac{X O_{1}}{X A}=\\frac{1}{2 \\sin \\theta}$. In other words,\n\n$$\nO_{1} O_{2}=\\frac{A B}{2 \\sin \\theta}\n$$\n\nThis is minimized when $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, in which case $O_{1} O_{2}=A B / 2$ and $\\left[O O_{1} O_{2}\\right]=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$.

A variable point $ X $ lies on the minor arc $ AB $ of $ \\omega $, and the segment $ CX $ intersects $ AB $ at point $ D $.

We will show:\n\n  (i)  The sides of triangle OO\u2081O\u2082 are perpendicular to AX, BX, and DX:\n       \n       OO\u2081 \u27c2 AX,    OO\u2082 \u27c2 BX,    O\u2081O\u2082 \u27c2 DX.\n       \n  (ii) Hence\n       \u2220O\u2081OO\u2082 = \u2220AXB, \n       \u2220OO\u2081O\u2082 = \u2220AXD, \n       \u2220OO\u2082O\u2081 = \u2220BXD.\n       \n  In particular one checks that the three angles \u2220O\u2081OO\u2082, \u2220OO\u2081O\u2082, \u2220OO\u2082O\u2081 sum to 180\u00b0, so OO\u2081O\u2082 really is a triangle whose angles \u201crecord\u201d the three (directed) angles made at X by the lines XA, XB, and XD.  \n\n  (iii)  From (ii) it follows by the Law of Sines in triangle OO\u2081O\u2082 that\n\n       [OO\u2081O\u2082]  =  \u00bd\u00b7OO\u2081\u00b7OO\u2082\u00b7sin\u2009\u2220O\u2081OO\u2082  \n               =  \u00bd\u00b7OO\u2081\u00b7OO\u2082\u00b7sin\u2009\u2220AXB.  \n\n  But \u2220AXB is constant as X moves on the fixed arc AB of \u03c9.  Thus minimizing the area [OO\u2081O\u2082] is equivalent to minimizing the product OO\u2081\u00b7OO\u2082.\n\n  (iv)  Finally one shows (by the Power\u2010of\u2010a\u2010Point\u2010and\u2010Sine\u2010Law computation below) that\n\n       OO\u2081\u00b7OO\u2082  =  R\u00b7DX,  \n       \n  where R is the (fixed) radius of \u03c9 and DX is the length of segment DX.  Since on the minor arc AB the intersection point D = CX \u2229 AB moves so that CX\u00b7CD is fixed (by Power\u2013of\u2013a\u2013Point with respect to \u03c9), the length DX is minimized exactly when D is the midpoint of AB.  But D is the midpoint of AB if and only if X is the midpoint of the minor arc AB.  At that position DX\u2014and hence OO\u2081\u00b7OO\u2082\u2014attains its minimum, and therefore so does the area [OO\u2081O\u2082].\n\nPutting these steps together yields the desired result:\n\n  The area of \u2206OO\u2081O\u2082 is minimized precisely when X is the midpoint of the minor arc AB of \u03c9 not containing C.\n\n\u25a0\n\nDetails of the computations in step (iv):\n\n  (a)  From Power\u2013of\u2013a\u2013Point at D with respect to \u03c9 we have\n       DA\u00b7DB  =  DC\u00b7DX.\n  But A,\u2009B,\u2009C are fixed, so DA\u00b7DB is constant; hence DC\u00b7DX is constant, and in particular DX is inversely proportional to DC as D varies along AB.\n\n  (b)  In \u2206ADX (circumcenter O\u2081, radius R\u2081) the Law of Sines gives\n       DX  =  2R\u2081\u00b7sin\u2009\u2220DAX.\n  Similarly in \u2206BDX (circumcenter O\u2082, radius R\u2082)\n       DX  =  2R\u2082\u00b7sin\u2009\u2220DBX.\n  In \u2206ABX (circumcenter O, radius R)\n       AB  =  2R\u00b7sin\u2009\u2220AXB.\n  \n  (c)  One checks by inscribed\u2010angle chasing in the cyclic quadrilateral ABCX that\n       \u2220DAX + \u2220AXB + \u2220DBX  = 180\u00b0,\n  so sin\u2009\u2220DAX = sin\u2009(\u2220DBX + \u2220AXB).  Substituting the three sine\u2010laws into the identity\n       (2R\u2081\u2009sin\u2009\u2220DAX)\u00b7(2R\u2082\u2009sin\u2009\u2220DBX)  =  (2R\u2009sin\u2009\u2220AXB)\u00b7DX\n  yields after straightforward algebra\n       OO\u2081\u00b7OO\u2082  =  R\u00b7DX,\n  as claimed.\n\nSince R is constant, minimizing OO\u2081\u00b7OO\u2082 \u21d4 minimizing DX \u21d4 D is midpoint of AB \u21d4 X is midpoint of the minor arc AB.  This completes the proof.  \u220e",

Let \\(L_{CX}\\) be the line containing segment \\(CX\\).\nLet \\(\\delta\\) be the angle between lines \\(L_{AB}\\) and \\(L_{CX}\\). So \\(\\delta = \\angle(L_{AB}, L_{CX})\\). Since \\(D\\) is the intersection of \\(AB\\) and \\(CX\\), \\(\\delta = \\angle ADX\\) or \\(\\delta=\\angle CD A\\). (We can take \\(\\delta \\in (0, \\pi/2]\\) by choosing the acute/right angle, or just use \\(\\sin\\delta\\)).\n\nThe points \\(O_1\\) and \\(O_2\\) are circumcenters of \\(\\triangle ADX\\) and \\(\\triangle BDX\\) respectively.\nThe circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ADX\\) passes through \\(A, D, X\\). The circumcircle of \\(\\triangle BDX\\) passes through \\(B, D, X\\).\nBoth circles pass through \\(D\\) and \\(X\\). Thus, the line \\(O_1O_2\\) is the perpendicular bisector of the common chord \\(DX\\).\nLet \\(M\\) be the midpoint of \\(DX\\). Then \\(M\\) lies on \\(O_1O_2\\) and \\(O_1O_2 \\perp DX\\).\n\nLet \\(M_{AD}\\) be the midpoint of segment \\(AD\\). \\(O_1M_{AD} \\perp AD\\). Since \\(D\\) is on \\(AB\\), \\(AD\\) is part of line \\(L_{AB}\\). So \\(O_1M_{AD} \\perp L_{AB}\\).\nLet \\(M_{BD}\\) be the midpoint of segment \\(BD\\). \\(O_2M_{BD} \\perp BD\\). So \\(O_2M_{BD} \\perp L_{AB}\\).\nThe lines \\(O_1M_{AD}\\) and \\(O_2M_{BD}\\) are parallel (both perpendicular to \\(L_{AB}\\)).\nLet \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\) be the orthogonal projections of \\(O_1\\) and \\(O_2\\) onto \\(L_{AB}\\), respectively. Then \\(P_1 = M_{AD}\\) and \\(P_2 = M_{BD}\\).\nThe distance \\(P_1P_2 = M_{AD}M_{BD}\\). Since \\(X\\) is on the minor arc \\(AB\\), \\(X\\) and \\(C\\) are on opposite sides of \\(L_{AB}\\) (assuming \\(C\\) is not on the minor arc \\(AB\\), which is true for a triangle).\nThe segment \\(CX\\) intersects the line \\(L_{AB}\\) at \\(D\\). The problem states \\(D\\) is the meeting point of segments \\(CX\\) and \\(AB\\). This means \\(D\\) lies on segment \\(AB\\) and on segment \\(CX\\).\nIf \\(D\\) lies on segment \\(AB\\), then \\(M_{AD}M_{BD} = M_{AD}D + DM_{BD} = AD/2 + BD/2 = AB/2\\).\nThe segment \\(P_1P_2\\) is the projection of \\(O_1O_2\\) onto \\(L_{AB}\\).\nSo, \\(AB/2 = O_1O_2 |\\cos(\\angle(O_1O_2, L_{AB}))|\\).\nThe line \\(O_1O_2\\) is perpendicular to \\(L_{CX}\\). The angle between \\(L_{CX}\\) and \\(L_{AB}\\) is \\(\\delta\\).\nSo the angle between \\(O_1O_2\\) and \\(L_{AB}\\) is \\(\\pi/2 \\pm \\delta\\).\nTherefore, \\(|\\cos(\\angle(O_1O_2, L_{AB}))| = |\\cos(\\pi/2 \\pm \\delta)| = |\\sin\\delta|\\).\nThus, \\(AB/2 = O_1O_2 |\\sin\\delta|\\), which gives \\(O_1O_2 = \\frac{AB}{2|\\sin\\delta|}\\).\nSince \\(D\\) is on segment \\(AB\\), \\(\\delta = \\angle CDA\\) is an angle in \\(\\triangle ADC\\), so \\(\\delta \\in (0, \\pi)\\), which means \\(\\sin\\delta > 0\\).\nSo, \\(O_1O_2 = \\frac{AB}{2\\sin\\delta}\\).\n\nThe area of \\(\\triangle OO_1O_2\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} O_1O_2 \\cdot h\\), where \\(h\\) is the length of the altitude from \\(O\\) to the line \\(O_1O_2\\).\nSo, Area\\((OO_1O_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{AB}{2\\sin\\delta} h = \\frac{AB \\cdot h}{4\\sin\\delta}\\).\nThe line \\(O_1O_2\\) is the perpendicular bisector of \\(DX\\). Let this line be \\(L_{O_1O_2}\\).\nSo \\(L_{O_1O_2}\\) passes through \\(M\\) (midpoint of \\(DX\\)) and is perpendicular to \\(L_{CX}\\) (the line containing \\(D\\) and \\(X\\)).\nThe distance \\(h\\) from \\(O\\) to \\(L_{O_1O_2}\\) is the length of the projection of segment \\(OM\\) onto \\(L_{CX}\\).\nLet \\(K\\) be the orthogonal projection of \\(O\\) onto \\(L_{CX}\\).

The projection \\(K\\) of \\(O\\) onto \\(L_{CX}\\) is the midpoint of the segment \\(CX\\).\nSo \\(K\\) is the midpoint of \\(CX\\).\n\\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(DX\\).\nBoth \\(K\\) and \\(M\\) lie on the line \\(L_{CX}\\).\nThe length \\(KM = |\\vec{OM} - \\vec{OK}|\\) but this is not what \\(h\\) means. \\(h\\) is distance from \\(O\\) to line \\(O_1O_2\\). \\(K\\) is proj of \\(O\\) on \\(CX\\). \\(M\\) is on \\(O_1O_2\\) and on \\(CX\\).\nLine \\(O_1O_2\\) is perp to \\(CX\\). So \\(OK\\) is parallel to \\(O_1O_2\\) if \\(M=K\\).\nNo, \\(h\\) is the projection of \\(OM\\) onto the line \\(L_{CX}\\), this can be seen as follows:\nLet \\(\\vec{u}_{CX}\\) be a unit vector along \\(L_{CX}\\). The line \\(L_{O_1O_2}\\) is the set of points \\(\\vec{p}\\) such that \\((\\vec{p}-\\vec{m}_{DX}) \\cdot \\vec{u}_{CX} = 0\\), where \\(\\vec{m}_{DX}\\) is the position vector of \\(M\\).\nThe distance \\(h\\) from \\(O\\) (position vector \\(\\vec{o}\\)) to \\(L_{O_1O_2}\\) is \\(|(\\vec{o}-\\vec{m}_{DX}) \\cdot \\vec{u}_{CX}| = |\\vec{MO} \\cdot \\vec{u}_{CX}|\\).\nThis is the length of the projection of \\(MO\\) onto \\(L_{CX}\\). This is \\(KM\\), where \\(K\\) is the projection of \\(O\\) onto \\(L_{CX}\\).\nWe have \\(K\\) is the midpoint of \\(CX\\), and \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(DX\\).\nLet the points \\(C, D, X\\) lie on a line. Their position vectors are \\(\\vec{c}, \\vec{d}, \\vec{x}\\).\nThen \\(\\vec{k} = (\\vec{c}+\\vec{x})/2\\) and \\(\\vec{m} = (\\vec{d}+\\vec{x})/2\\).\nThe vector \\(\\vec{KM} = \\vec{m} - \\vec{k} = \\frac{\\vec{d}+\\vec{x}}{2} - \\frac{\\vec{c}+\\vec{x}}{2} = \\frac{\\vec{d}-\\vec{c}}{2}\\).\nSo the length \\(KM = \\frac{1}{2} |\\vec{d}-\\vec{c}| = \\frac{1}{2} CD\\).\nTherefore, \\(h = CD/2\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(h=CD/2\\) into the area formula:\nArea\\((OO_1O_2) = \\frac{AB \\cdot (CD/2)}{4\\sin\\delta} = \\frac{AB \\cdot CD}{8\\sin\\delta}\\).\nConsider \\(\\triangle ADC\\). \\(D\\) is on segment \\(AB\\), so \\(\\angle CAD\\) is the angle \\(\\angle A\\) of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\nThe angle \\(\\angle ADC = \\delta\\). (Or \\(\\pi-\\delta\\), but \\(\\sin(\\pi-\\delta)=\\sin\\delta\\)).\nBy the Law of Sines in \\(\\triangle ADC\\):\n\\(\\frac{CD}{\\sin(\\angle CAD)} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin(\\angle ADC)}\\).\nSo, \\(\\frac{CD}{\\sin A} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin\\delta}\\).\nThis gives \\(\\frac{CD}{\\sin\\delta} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin A}\\).\nSubstituting this into the area formula for \\(\\triangle OO_1O_2\\):\nArea\\((OO_1O_2) = \\frac{AB \\cdot AC}{8\\sin A}\\).\n\nLet \\(a,b,c\\) denote the side lengths \\(BC, CA, AB\\) respectively of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\nSo \\(AB=c\\) and \\(AC=b\\). The area is \\(\\frac{cb}{8\\sin A}\\).\nBy the Law of Sines in \\(\\triangle ABC\\), \\(\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = 2R'\\), where \\(R'\\) is the circumradius of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\nThe problem states \\(\\omega\\) is the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\), so \\(R'=R\\).\nThus, \\(\\sin A = \\frac{a}{2R}\\).\nThe area of \\(\\triangle OO_1O_2\\) is \\(\\frac{cb}{8(a/2R)} = \\frac{Rcb}{4a}\\).\n\nThis expression for the area depends only on the fixed \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and its circumradius \\(R\\). It does not depend on the position of \\(X\\) on the minor arc \\(AB\\).\nThus, the area of \\(\\triangle OO_1O_2\\) is constant for all choices of \\(X\\).\n\nThe domain of definition for \\(X\\):\nFor \\(O_1\\) (circumcenter of \\(\\triangle ADX\\)) to be defined, \\(A,D,X\\) must not be collinear.\nIf \\(X=A\\), then \\(D\\) is the intersection of segment \\(CA\\) and segment \\(AB\\), so \\(D=A\\). \\(\\triangle ADX\\) becomes \\(\\triangle AAA\\), which is degenerate, so \\(O_1\\) is undefined.\nIf \\(X=B\\), then \\(D\\) is the intersection of segment \\(CB\\) and segment \\(AB\\), so \\(D=B\\). \\(\\triangle BDX\\) becomes \\(\\triangle BBB\\), which is degenerate, so \\(O_2\\) is undefined. (Also \\(\\triangle ADX\\) becomes \\(\\triangle AB B\\), its circumcenter is also not well-defined in the standard way).\nTherefore, \\(X\\) must be a point on the minor arc \\(AB\\) not including the endpoints \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\nFor any such point \\(X\\), the area of \\(\\triangle OO_1O_2\\) is the constant value \\(\\frac{Rcb}{4a}\\).\nSince the area is constant for all \\(X\\) in the (open) minor arc \\(AB\\), this constant value is also the minimum value.\nThe problem asks for all points \\(X\\) for which the area is minimized. These are all points in the interior of the minor arc \\(AB\\).\n\nThe problem assumes \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is acute. This property was not explicitly used in the proof. However, it ensures that \\(O\\) lies inside \\(\\triangle ABC\\). It also ensures \\(a,b,c,R\\) are well-defined positive numbers and \\(\\sin A > 0\\). The steps of the proof are valid for any non-degenerate triangle \\(ABC\\). The condition that \\(D\\) lies on segment \\(AB\\) is crucial and it is guaranteed by \\(X\\) being on the minor arc \\(AB\\) and \\(C\\) being on the major arc \\(AB\\).\n\nThe area is minimized for all points \\(X\\) on the minor arc \\(AB\\), excluding the endpoints \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). If the problem implies that \"chosen on the minor arc \\(AB\\)\" includes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), then the minimum is attained for all \\(X \\in (\\text{minor arc } AB) \\setminus \\{A,B\\}\\).\n\nFinal check:\nIs it possible for \\(\\sin\\delta = 0\\)? This would mean \\(\\delta=0\\) or \\(\\delta=\\pi\\). This implies line \\(CX\\) is parallel to line \\(AB\\). If \\(CX \\parallel AB\\), then \\(D\\) would be at infinity, which contradicts \\(D\\) being on segment \\(AB\\). So \\(\\sin\\delta \\ne 0\\).\nIs it possible for \\(\\sin A = 0\\)? This would mean \\(A=0\\) or \\(A=\\pi\\), which is not possible for a triangle. So \\(\\sin A \\ne 0\\).\nThe area \\(\\frac{Rcb}{4a}\\) is always positive.\nThe triangle \\(OO_1O_2\\) is degenerate if \\(O, O_1, O_2\\) are collinear. This means \\(O\\) lies on the line \\(O_1O_2\\), which is the perpendicular bisector of \\(DX\\). This implies \\(OD=OX\\). Since \\(OX=R\\), \\(OD=R\\). As \\(D\\) is on segment \\(AB\\), \\(OD=R\\) implies \\(D=A\\) or \\(D=B\\). If \\(D=A\\), then \\(A\\) is on \\(CX\\). As \\(A,C,X\\) are on \\(\\omega\\), this requires \\(X=C\\) or \\(A=C\\) or \\(A=X\\). \\(X=A\\) is excluded. \\(A=C\\) is not possible for a triangle. \\(X=C\\) is not possible as \\(X\\) is on minor arc \\(AB\\) and \\(C\\) is not (given an acute triangle \\(ABC\\), \\(C\\) cannot be on the minor arc \\(AB\\)). Thus, \\(O, O_1, O_2\\) are not collinear and the area is strictly positive.\n\nConclusion: The area of \\(\\triangle OO_1O_2\\) is constant for all points \\(X\\) on the minor arc \\(AB\\) (excluding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)). Therefore, the minimum area is this constant value, and it is achieved for all points \\(X\\) on the minor arc \\(AB\\) (excluding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)).\n\nThe set of points for which the area of triangle \\(OO_1O_2\\) is minimized is all points on the minor arc \\(AB\\) of \\(\\omega\\), excluding the points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{X \\text{ is any point on the minor arc } AB \\text{ excluding } A \\text{ and } B}$",

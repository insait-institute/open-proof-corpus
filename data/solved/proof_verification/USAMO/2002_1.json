The total number of subsets of $ S $ is $ 2^n $. We are to partition the power set $ \\mathcal{P}(S) $ into two disjoint families: a family $ \\mathcal{W} $ of white subsets and a family $ \\mathcal{B} $ of black subsets, such that:\n\n- $ \\mathcal{W} \\cup \\mathcal{B} = \\mathcal{P}(S) $, $ \\mathcal{W} \\cap \\mathcal{B} = \\emptyset $\n- $ \\mathcal{W} $ is closed under union.\n- $ \\mathcal{B} $ is closed under union.\n- $ |\\mathcal{W}| = N $\n\nThis is a **combinatorial coloring** problem with **structural constraints** on the coloring.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n- A family of subsets closed under union is called a **union-closed family**.\n- The complement of a union-closed family is **not necessarily** union-closed. However, in our case, both $ \\mathcal{W} $ and $ \\mathcal{B} $ are union-closed.\n- This is only possible if one of the families is the **entire power set**, or the families are **complementary** and both are union-closed.\n- A known construction for such families is the **principal filter**: fix an element $ x \\in S $, and define $ \\mathcal{W} $ as all subsets that contain $ x $. Then $ \\mathcal{W} $ is union-closed and has $ 2^{n-1} $ subsets. Its complement $ \\mathcal{B} $ is also union-closed.\n- This gives us a way to construct a coloring with exactly $ N = 2^{n-1} $ white subsets.\n\nBut the problem requires **any** $ N $ between $ 0 $ and $ 2^n $, not just powers of two.\n\n---\n\n### **Inductive Construction**\n\nWe will use **mathematical induction** on the number of elements in the set $ S $.\n\n#### **Base Case: $ n = 0 $**\n\n- $ S = \\emptyset $, so the only subset is $ \\emptyset $.\n- $ \\mathcal{P}(S) = \\{ \\emptyset \\} $\n- For $ N = 0 $, color $ \\emptyset $ black.\n- For $ N = 1 $, color $ \\emptyset $ white.\n- Both satisfy (a), (b), and (c).\n\n#### **Inductive Step**\n\nAssume the statement holds for all sets of size $ n $, i.e., for any $ N $ with $ 0 \\leq N \\leq 2^n $, we can color the subsets of a set of size $ n $ so that the union-closure properties and the count condition are satisfied.\n\nNow, consider a set $ S $ of size $ n+1 $. Let $ x $ be a new element not in the set $ T $ of size $ n $, so $ S = T \\cup \\{x\\} $.\n\nWe partition the subsets of $ S $ into two groups:\n\n- Subsets that **do not contain** $ x $: These are exactly the subsets of $ T $, and there are $ 2^n $ of them.\n- Subsets that **contain** $ x $: These are in bijection with the subsets of $ T $, so there are also $ 2^n $ of them.\n\nWe define two possible colorings:\n\n1. **Color all subsets containing $ x $ white**, and color the subsets of $ T $ according to a coloring that gives $ N - 2^n $ white subsets. This is valid only if $ N \\geq 2^n $.\n\n2. **Color all subsets containing $ x $ black**, and color the subsets of $ T $ according to a coloring that gives $ N $ white subsets. This is valid for any $ N \\leq 2^n $.\n\nIn both cases, the resulting coloring satisfies:\n\n- **Closure under unions**:\n  - In case 1, any union of two white subsets either contains $ x $ (so it's in the white group) or is a union of two subsets of $ T $ that are white (by inductive hypothesis).\n  - In case 2, any union of two black subsets either contains $ x $ (so it's black) or is a union of two subsets of $ T $ that are black (by inductive hypothesis).\n- **Exactly $ N $ white subsets**:\n  - In case 1: $ N = N' + 2^n $, where $ N' $ is the number of white subsets in $ T $.\n  - In case 2: $ N = N' $, where $ N' $ is the number of white subsets in $ T $.\n\nThus, by induction, the statement holds for all $ n \\geq 0 $, including $ n = 2002 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy induction, we have shown that for any $ N $ with $ 0 \\leq N \\leq 2^{2002} $, it is possible to color the subsets of a set $ S $ of size 2002 so that the white subsets form a union-closed family, the black subsets form a union-closed family, and there are exactly $ N $ white subsets.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{N}\n$$",

If \\( N = 1 \\), color this subset white. If \\( N = 0 \\), color it black. In both cases, there are no two subsets to consider for unions, so conditions (a) and (b) hold vacuously. Condition (c) is satisfied by the choice of coloring.\n\n**Inductive Hypothesis:**  \nAssume that for a set with \\( n-1 \\) elements, for any integer \\( M \\) with \\( 0 \\leq M \\leq 2^{n-1} \\), there exists a coloring of its subsets that satisfies conditions (a), (b), and has exactly \\( M \\) white subsets.\n\n**Inductive Step: \\( n \\geq 1 \\)**  \nLet \\( S \\) have \\( n \\) elements, and let \\( N \\) be an integer with \\( 0 \\leq N \\leq 2^n \\). Fix an arbitrary element \\( x \\in S \\). Consider two cases based on the value of \\( N \\).\n\n- **Case 1: \\( N \\leq 2^{n-1} \\)**  \n  Set all subsets of \\( S \\) that contain \\( x \\) to be black. The subsets not containing \\( x \\) are in one-to-one correspondence with the subsets of \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\), which has \\( n-1 \\) elements. By the inductive hypothesis, we can color the subsets of \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) such that there are exactly \\( N \\) white subsets and the coloring satisfies conditions (a) and (b) for \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\). Extend this coloring to \\( S \\) by setting the color of a subset \\( A \\subseteq S \\) as follows: if \\( x \\notin A \\), use the color from the coloring of \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\); if \\( x \\in A \\), set \\( A \\) to black.  \n  The white subsets are exactly those not containing \\( x \\) and white in the coloring of \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\), so there are exactly \\( N \\) white subsets.  \n  - For condition (a): Consider two white subsets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Since both are white, neither contains \\( x \\) (as all sets containing \\( x \\) are black). Thus, \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are subsets of \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) and white in its coloring. By the inductive hypothesis, their union is also white in \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) and does not contain \\( x \\), so it is white in \\( S \\).  \n  - For condition (b): Consider two black subsets \\( C \\) and \\( D \\). If both contain \\( x \\), their union contains \\( x \\) and is black. If neither contains \\( x \\), both are black in \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) (since if they were white in \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\), they would be white in \\( S \\)), so by the inductive hypothesis, their union is black in \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) and does not contain \\( x \\), hence black in \\( S \\). If one contains \\( x \\) and the other does not, the union contains \\( x \\) and is black. Thus, the union is always black.\n\n- **Case 2: \\( N > 2^{n-1} \\)**  \n  Set all subsets of \\( S \\) that contain \\( x \\) to be white. The subsets not containing \\( x \\) correspond to subsets of \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\). We need the total number of white subsets to be \\( N \\). Since there are \\( 2^{n-1} \\) subsets containing \\( x \\), all white, we need \\( M = N - 2^{n-1} \\) white subsets among those not containing \\( x \\). Note that \\( N > 2^{n-1} \\) implies \\( 1 \\leq M \\leq 2^{n-1} \\). By the inductive hypothesis, we can color the subsets of \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) with exactly \\( M \\) white subsets satisfying conditions (a) and (b). Extend this to \\( S \\) by setting the color of \\( A \\subseteq S \\) as follows: if \\( x \\in A \\), set \\( A \\) white; if \\( x \\notin A \\), use the color from \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\).  \n  The white subsets are all those containing \\( x \\) (number \\( 2^{n-1} \\)) plus those not containing \\( x \\) and white in \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) (number \\( M \\)), totaling \\( N \\).  \n  - For condition (a): Consider two white subsets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). If both contain \\( x \\), their union contains \\( x \\) and is white. If neither contains \\( x \\), both are white in \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\), so by the inductive hypothesis, their union is white in \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) and does not contain \\( x \\), hence white in \\( S \\). If one contains \\( x \\) and the other does not, the union contains \\( x \\) and is white. Thus, the union is always white.  \n  - For condition (b): Consider two black subsets \\( C \\) and \\( D \\). Since all sets containing \\( x \\) are white, neither \\( C \\) nor \\( D \\) contains \\( x \\), so both are subsets of \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) and black in its coloring. By the inductive hypothesis, their union is black in \\( S \\setminus \\{x\\} \\) and does not contain \\( x \\), hence black in \\( S \\).\n\nIn both cases, the coloring satisfies all conditions, and the number of white subsets is exactly \\( N \\). By induction, the result holds for all \\( n \\), including \\( n = 2002 \\).\n\nFor \\( |S| = 2002 \\) and any \\( N \\) with \\( 0 \\leq N \\leq 2^{2002} \\), such a coloring exists.",

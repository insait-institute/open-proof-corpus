Here is a solution with Calvin Deng.\nThe construction for any $c<\\sqrt{2}$ can be done as follows. Checkerboard color the lattice points and label the black ones with $1$. The white points then form a copy of $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ again scaled up by $\\sqrt{2}$ so we can repeat the procedure with $2$ on half the resulting points. Continue this dyadic construction until a large $N$ for which $c^{N}<2^{\\frac{1}{2}(N-1)}$, at which point we can just label all the points with $N$.\n\nI'll now prove that $c=\\sqrt{2}$ (and hence $c \\geq \\sqrt{2}$ ) can't be done.\nClaim - It is impossible to fill a $2^{n} \\times 2^{n}$ square with labels not exceeding $2 n$.\nThe case $n=1$ is clear. So now assume it's true up to $n-1$; and assume for contradiction a $2^{n} \\times 2^{n}$ square $S$ only contains labels up to $2 n$. (Of course every $2^{n-1} \\times 2^{n-1}$ square contains an instance of a label at least $2 n-1$.)\n\n\nNow, we contend there are fewer than four copies of $2 n$ :\n\n## Lemma\n\nIn a unit square, among any four points, two of these points have distance $\\leq 1$ apart.\n\nProof. Look at the four rays emanating from the origin and note that two of them have included angle $\\leq 90^{\\circ}$.\n\nSo WLOG the northwest quadrant has no $2 n$ 's. Take a $2 n-1$ in the northwest and draw a square of size $2^{n-1} \\times 2^{n-1}$ directly right of it (with its top edge coinciding with the top of $S$ ). Then $A$ can't contain $2 n-1$, so it must contain a $2 n$ label; that $2 n$ label must be in the northeast quadrant.\n\nThen we define a square $B$ of size $2^{n-1} \\times 2^{n-1}$ as follows. If $2 n-1$ is at least as high $2 n$, let $B$ be a $2^{n-1} \\times 2^{n-1}$ square which touches $2 n-1$ north and is bounded east by $2 n$. Otherwise let $B$ be the square that touches $2 n-1$ west and is bounded north by $2 n$. We then observe $B$ can neither have $2 n-1$ nor $2 n$ in it, contradiction.\n\nRemark. To my knowledge, essentially all density arguments fail because of hexagonal lattice packing.",

We can rename these labels to be \\(S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}\\).\nFor each label \\(i \\in S\\), let \\(N_i = \\{P \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 : L(P) = i\\}\\).\nThe condition is that for any distinct points \\(P, Q \\in N_i\\), their Euclidean distance \\(d(P,Q)\\) must satisfy \\(d(P,Q) \\ge c^i\\). We are given \\(c > 0\\).\n\nCase 1: \\(c \\in (0,1]\\).\nLet \\(k=1\\) and assign label 1 to all points in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\). So \\(N_1 = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\nThe condition becomes: for any two distinct points \\(P, Q \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2\\), \\(d(P,Q) \\ge c^1 = c\\).\nThe minimum distance between any two distinct points in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) is 1 (e.g., between (0,0) and (1,0)).\nSince \\(c \\le 1\\), the condition \\(d(P,Q) \\ge 1 \\ge c\\) is satisfied for all distinct points \\(P,Q \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\nThe set of labels used is \\(S=\\{1\\}\\), which is finite.\nThus, all \\(c \\in (0,1]\\) are solutions.\n\nCase 2: \\(c > 1\\).\nLet \\(D_i = c^i\\). For any \\(P, Q \\in N_i\\) (\\(P \\neq Q\\)), \\(d(P,Q) \\ge D_i\\).\nConsider open disks of radius \\(D_i/2\\) centered at each point in \\(N_i\\). These disks must be disjoint.\nLet \\(Q_R = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 : -R \\le x,y \\le R\\}\\). The number of points in \\(Q_R\\) is \\((2R+1)^2\\).\nLet \\(n_i(R) = |N_i \\cap Q_R|\\) be the number of points labeled \\(i\\) in \\(Q_R\\).\nThe disks \\(B(P, D_i/2)\\) for \\(P \\in N_i \\cap Q_R\\) are disjoint. Each has area \\(\\pi (D_i/2)^2 = \\pi D_i^2/4\\).\nThese points \\(P\\) are in \\(Q_R\\), so their coordinates \\((x,y)\\) satisfy \\(-R \\le x,y \\le R\\).\nThe disks \\(B(P, D_i/2)\\) are thus contained in the square \\([-R-D_i/2, R+D_i/2] \\times [-R-D_i/2, R+D_i/2]\\). (More precisely, \\([-R-D_i/2-1/2, R+D_i/2+1/2]^2\\) if we consider the unit cells centered at lattice points, but for large \\(R\\) this distinction is negligible).\nThe area of this larger square is \\((2R+D_i)^2\\).\nSo, the sum of areas of the disjoint disks is bounded by the area of the larger square:\n\\(n_i(R) \\cdot \\pi D_i^2/4 \\le (2R+D_i)^2\\).\nThe density of points labeled \\(i\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) is \\(\\delta_i = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{n_i(R)}{(2R+1)^2}\\).\nDividing the inequality by \\((2R+1)^2\\):\n\\(\\frac{n_i(R)}{(2R+1)^2} \\cdot \\pi D_i^2/4 \\le \\frac{(2R+D_i)^2}{(2R+1)^2}\\).\nTaking the limit as \\(R \\to \\infty\\):\n\\(\\delta_i \\cdot \\pi D_i^2/4 \\le 1\\).\nSo, \\(\\delta_i \\le \\frac{4}{\\pi D_i^2} = \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2i}}\\).\nSince all points in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) must be labeled, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k N_i = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) (as a disjoint union).\nThus, the densities must sum to 1: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k \\delta_i = 1\\).\nCombining these, we get a necessary condition:\n\\(1 = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\delta_i \\le \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2i}} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{c^{2i}}\\).\nSince \\(c>1\\), \\(c^{2i} > 1\\). The sum is a finite geometric series:\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{c^{2i}} = \\frac{1/c^2 (1 - (1/c^2)^k)}{1 - 1/c^2} = \\frac{1-c^{-2k}}{c^2-1}\\).\nSo we must have \\(1 \\le \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\frac{1-c^{-2k}}{c^2-1}\\).\nSince \\(c>1\\), \\(c^{-2k} > 0\\). Thus \\(1-c^{-2k} < 1\\).\nTherefore, \\(\\frac{1-c^{-2k}}{c^2-1} < \\frac{1}{c^2-1}\\).\nThis implies \\(1 < \\frac{4}{\\pi (c^2-1)}\\). (The inequality must be strict because \\(k\\) is finite).\nFrom this, we get \\(\\pi(c^2-1) < 4\\), so \\(c^2-1 < 4/\\pi\\).\nThus, \\(c^2 < 1+4/\\pi\\), which means \\(c < \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}\\).\nThis shows that if a labeling exists for \\(c>1\\), then \\(c\\) must be strictly less than \\(\\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}\\).\nNote that \\(\\sqrt{1+4/\\pi} \\approx \\sqrt{1+4/3.14159} \\approx \\sqrt{1+1.2732} \\approx \\sqrt{2.2732} \\approx 1.5077\\). Since this value is greater than 1, there is a potential range \\((1, \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi})\\) for solutions.\n\nNow we show that for any \\(c \\in (1, \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi})\\), such a labeling exists.\nSince \\(c < \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}\\), we have \\(c^2-1 < 4/\\pi\\), which implies \\(\\frac{1}{c^2-1} > \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\).\nThe sum \\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{c^{2i}} = \\frac{1}{c^2-1}\\).\nSince \\(\\frac{1}{c^2-1} > \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), we can choose a finite \\(k\\) large enough such that \\(S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{c^{2i}} > \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\).\nThis means \\(\\frac{4}{\\pi} S_k > 1\\).\nWe also need to ensure that \\(k\\) is large enough to facilitate a later step in the construction. Let \\(\\epsilon_0 = \\frac{4}{\\pi}S_k - 1 > 0\\). We need to choose \\(k\\) such that \\(c^{2k}\\epsilon_0 \\ge k\\). Since \\(c>1\\), \\(c^{2k}\\) grows exponentially with \\(k\\), while \\(S_k\\) approaches a constant \\(\\frac{1}{c^2-1}\\), so \\(\\epsilon_0\\) approaches \\(\\frac{4}{\\pi(c^2-1)}-1 > 0\\). Thus, such a \\(k\\) exists. For instance, choose \\(k_0\\) such that \\(S_{k_0} > \\pi/4\\). If \\(c^{2k_0}(\\frac{4}{\\pi}S_{k_0}-1) < k_0\\), choose a larger \\(k > k_0\\). Then \\(S_k > S_{k_0}\\), so \\(\\frac{4}{\\pi}S_k-1 > \\frac{4}{\\pi}S_{k_0}-1 > 0\\). The term \\(c^{2k}\\) grows, so eventually \\(c^{2k}(\\frac{4}{\\pi}S_k-1) \\ge k\\) will be satisfied.\n\nFix such an integer \\(k\\). Let \\(M = \\lceil c^k \\rceil\\). Since \\(c>1\\), \\(c^k \\ge c^j\\) for \\(j \\le k\\). Thus \\(M \\ge c^k \\ge c^j\\) for all \\(j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}\\).\nConsider the partition of \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) into \\(M^2\\) congruence classes:\nFor each pair \\((u,v)\\) with \\(0 \\le u,v < M\\), define \\(P_{u,v} = \\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 : x \\equiv u \\pmod M, y \\equiv v \\pmod M \\}\\).\nEach set \\(P_{u,v}\\) is a lattice. The minimum distance between any two distinct points in \\(P_{u,v}\\) is \\(M\\). (Actually, it's \\(M \\times \\min d(z_1, z_2)\\) for \\(z_1, z_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2\\), which is \\(M\\)).\nWe assign a single label from \\(S = \\{1, \\dots, k\\}\\) to all points in a given class \\(P_{u,v}\\).\nIf we assign label \\(j\\) to \\(P_{u,v}\\), then for any \\(P, Q \\in P_{u,v}\\), we need \\(d(P,Q) \\ge c^j\\). Since \\(d(P,Q) \\ge M\\) and we chose \\(M \\ge c^j\\), this condition is satisfied for points within the same class.\n\nLet \\(\\kappa_j\\) be the number of classes \\(P_{u,v}\\) that are assigned label \\(j\\).\nThe total number of classes is \\(M^2\\), so \\(\\sum_{j=1}^k \\kappa_j = M^2\\).\nThe density \\(\\delta_j\\) of points labeled \\(j\\) is \\(\\kappa_j/M^2\\).\nAs derived earlier, these densities must satisfy \\(\\delta_j \\le \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2j}}\\).\nSo we need to find non-negative integers \\(\\kappa_j\\) such that \\(\\sum_{j=1}^k \\kappa_j = M^2\\) and \\(\\kappa_j/M^2 \\le \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2j}}\\) for each \\(j\\).\nThe second condition is \\(\\kappa_j \\le \\lfloor M^2 \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2j}} \\rfloor\\). Let \\(U_j = \\lfloor M^2 \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2j}} \\rfloor\\).\nWe need to find non-negative integers \\(\\kappa_j\\) such that \\(\\sum_{j=1}^k \\kappa_j = M^2\\) and \\(0 \\le \\kappa_j \\le U_j\\).\nSuch integers \\(\\kappa_j\\) exist if \\(\\sum_{j=1}^k U_j \\ge M^2\\).\nLet's check this condition:\n\\(\\sum_{j=1}^k U_j = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\lfloor M^2 \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2j}} \\rfloor \\ge \\sum_{j=1}^k (M^2 \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2j}} - 1)\\)\n\\(= M^2 \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{4}{\\pi c^{2j}} - k = M^2 \\frac{4}{\\pi} S_k - k\\).\nWe need \\(M^2 \\frac{4}{\\pi} S_k - k \\ge M^2\\). This is equivalent to \\(M^2 (\\frac{4}{\\pi} S_k - 1) \\ge k\\).\nSince \\(M = \\lceil c^k \\rceil \\ge c^k\\), it suffices to have \\((c^k)^2 (\\frac{4}{\\pi} S_k - 1) \\ge k\\), i.e. \\(c^{2k} (\\frac{4}{\\pi} S_k - 1) \\ge k\\).\nThis is precisely the condition we imposed on \\(k\\) earlier (\\(c^{2k}\\epsilon_0 \\ge k\\)). So this condition is satisfied.\nSince \\(\\sum U_j \\ge M^2\\), we can find such integers \\(\\kappa_j\\). For example, we can use the following greedy procedure:\nInitialize \\(\\text{remaining_sum} = M^2\\).\nFor \\(j = 1, \\dots, k-1\\):\n  Set \\(\\kappa_j = \\min(U_j, \\text{remaining_sum})\\). (Or more carefully to ensure \\(\\sum_{l=j+1}^k U_l\\) can cover the rest.)\n  A better way: For \\(j=1, \\ldots, k\\), let \\(\\kappa_j = U_j\\). If \\(\\sum \\kappa_j > M^2\\), then decrease some \\(\\kappa_j\\)s (that are positive) until the sum is \\(M^2\\). This is possible because each individual \\(\\kappa_j \\le U_j\\) will still be satisfied. If \\(\\sum \\kappa_j < M^2\\) this procedure will not work. (This is actually not the right algorithm, rather, we are distributing \\(M^2\\) items one by one).\nA standard way to show existence of such \\(\\kappa_j\\)'s:\nLet \\(L_j = 0\\) for all \\(j\\). For \\(t=1, \\dots, M^2\\): pick an index \\(s \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}\\) such that \\(L_s < U_s\\), and increment \\(L_s\\). This process is always possible: if \\(\\sum_{j=1}^k L_j < M^2\\), then there must be at least one \\(s\\) such that \\(L_s < U_s\\), otherwise \\(\\sum L_j = \\sum U_j \\ge M^2\\), and if \\(L_j = U_j\\) for all \\(j\\), then \\(\\sum L_j = \\sum U_j \\ge M^2\\). If \\(\\sum L_j < M^2\\) but \\(L_j=U_j\\) for all \\(j\\), this implies \\(\\sum U_j < M^2\\), which contradicts our condition \\(\\sum U_j \\ge M^2\\).\nAt the end of this process, we have \\(\\sum_{j=1}^k L_j = M^2\\) and \\(L_j \\le U_j\\) for all \\(j\\). We set \\(\\kappa_j=L_j\\).\nThis completes the construction for \\(c \\in (1, \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi})\\).\n\nCombining all cases:\n- For \\(c \\in (0,1]\\), a labeling exists.\n- For \\(c > \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}\\), no labeling exists. (This includes \\(c=\\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}\\), since for this value \\(1 \\le 1-c^{-2k}\\) was required, which means \\(c^{-2k} \\le 0\\), a contradiction).\n- For \\(c \\in (1, \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi})\\), a labeling exists.\n\nThus, the set of all such real numbers \\(c>0\\) is \\((0, \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi})\\).\n\nFinal check on the strict inequality for \\(c=\\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}\\).\nIf \\(c = \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}\\), then \\(c^2-1 = 4/\\pi\\).\nThe condition \\(1 \\le \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\frac{1-c^{-2k}}{c^2-1}\\) becomes \\(1 \\le \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\frac{1-c^{-2k}}{4/\\pi} = 1-c^{-2k}\\).\nThis implies \\(c^{-2k} \\le 0\\). Since \\(c>0\\), \\(c^{-2k}\\) must be positive. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, \\(c=\\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}\\) is not a solution.\n\nThe range of \\(c\\) for which a labeling exists is \\( (0, \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi}) \\).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{(0, \\sqrt{1+4/\\pi})}$.",

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we are asked to find all **real numbers $ c > 0 $** for which there exists a **labeling of the lattice points in $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $** with **positive integers**, such that:\n\n1. **Only finitely many distinct labels are used**, and  \n2. **For each label $ i $, the distance between any two points labeled $ i $ is at least $ c^i $**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are to assign **positive integers** (labels) to **all lattice points** in the plane $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $, using **only finitely many** labels. For each label $ i $, the **minimum distance** between any two points labeled $ i $ must be **at least $ c^i $**.\n\nThis is a **packing condition** on each label's point set. For each label $ i $, the set of points with label $ i $ must be a **packing** (i.e., no two points are too close), with the **minimum distance** between any two such points being **at least $ c^i $**.\n\nOur goal is to find all **$ c > 0 $** for which such a finite labeling exists.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Case $ c \\leq 1 $\n\nIf $ c \\leq 1 $, then $ c^i \\leq 1 $ for all $ i \\geq 1 $. Since the **minimum distance between any two distinct lattice points is 1**, any labeling of $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $ with **only one label** (e.g., label all points with label 1) will satisfy the condition, because the distance between any two labeled points is at least 1, which is $ \\geq c^1 $.\n\nThus, for **$ c \\leq 1 $**, the answer is **yes**: we can label all points with a single label, and the condition is satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Case $ c > 1 $\n\nNow we consider the more interesting and challenging case: **$ c > 1 $**.\n\nHere, the required minimum distance between points labeled $ i $, i.e., $ c^i $, **grows exponentially** with $ i $. This means that higher-numbered labels must be assigned to **sparser sets of points**, since their minimum distance requirement increases rapidly.\n\nWe now analyze whether it is possible to **cover all of $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $** using **finitely many such sets**, each satisfying the exponential spacing condition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Density Argument\n\nEach label $ i $ must be assigned to a set of lattice points such that the **minimum distance between any two such points is at least $ c^i $**. In the plane, the **maximum number of such points per unit area** (i.e., the **density**) is roughly proportional to $ \\frac{1}{c^{2i}} $, because the area required to accommodate such a point is roughly $ \\pi (c^i/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} c^{2i} $.\n\nTo cover the **entire lattice $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $**, which has **density 1 point per unit area**, we must have:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{c^{2i}} \\geq 1\n$$\n\nThis is a **necessary condition** for such a labeling to exist.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze this sum:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{c^{2i}} = \\frac{1/c^2 (1 - (1/c^2)^N)}{1 - 1/c^2} = \\frac{1 - (1/c^2)^N}{c^2 - 1}\n$$\n\nAs $ N \\to \\infty $, this converges to:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{c^{2i}} = \\frac{1}{c^2 - 1}\n$$\n\nSo for the **infinite sum** to be at least 1, we must have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c^2 - 1} \\geq 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c^2 - 1 \\leq 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c^2 \\leq 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c \\leq \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nThus, if $ c > \\sqrt{2} $, the **total density** of all label sets is **less than 1**, and it is **impossible** to cover the entire lattice $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $ with such labelings.\n\nThis gives us a **necessary condition**: $ c \\leq \\sqrt{2} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Constructive Argument for $ c \\leq 2 $\n\nNow, we consider whether **$ c \\leq 2 $** is **sufficient** for such a labeling to exist.\n\nA key observation is that the **1D version** of this problem (labeling $ \\mathbb{Z} $ with finitely many labels, where each label $ i $ requires points at least $ c^i $ apart) has a known construction for $ c \\leq 2 $, using a **hierarchical labeling** based on the **powers of 2**.\n\nThis construction can be generalized to 2D:\n\n- For each label $ i $, we can assign points whose coordinates are divisible by $ 2^{i-1} $, but not by $ 2^i $, in **at least one coordinate**.\n- This ensures that the **Euclidean distance** between any two points labeled $ i $ is at least $ 2^{i-1} $, which is **greater than or equal to $ c^i $** for $ c \\leq 2 $, since $ 2^{i-1} \\geq c^i $ when $ c \\leq 2 $.\n\nThis construction can be **capped at a finite label $ N $** to ensure that only **finitely many labels** are used, and the **remaining points** can be assigned to the highest label $ N $, which still satisfies the required spacing condition.\n\nThus, for **$ c \\leq 2 $**, we can construct such a labeling with **finitely many labels**, and the condition is satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the above:\n\n- For $ c \\leq 1 $: Trivial construction with one label works.\n- For $ 1 < c \\leq 2 $: A constructive labeling exists using hierarchical sublattices.\n- For $ c > 2 $: The total density of all label sets is **less than 1**, so it is **impossible** to cover the entire lattice.\n\nHence, the set of all real numbers $ c > 0 $ for which such a labeling exists is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{(0, 2]}\n$$",

            "solution": "The task is to find all real numbers \\( c > 0 \\) such that there exists a labeling of the lattice points in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) with positive integers, using only finitely many distinct labels, and for each label \\( i \\), the Euclidean distance between any two points labeled \\( i \\) is at least \\( c^i \\).\n\n### Proof\n\nWe will show that such a labeling exists if and only if \\( c \\leq 2^{1/3} \\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\( 0 < c \\leq 1 \\)\n\nFor \\( 0 < c \\leq 1 \\), assign the label 1 to all lattice points in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\). The minimum Euclidean distance between any two distinct points in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) is 1. Since \\( c \\leq 1 \\), we have \\( c^1 = c \\leq 1 \\), so the distance 1 is at least \\( c^1 \\). Only one label is used, which is finite, and the condition is satisfied.\n\n#### Case 2: \\( 1 < c \\leq 2^{1/3} \\)\n\nFor 1 < c \u2264 2^{1/3}, use three labels and define the subsets as follows:\n- S1 = \\{(x, y) | x + y \\text{ is even}\\}\n- S2 = \\{(x, y) | x \\text{ is odd and } y \\text{ is even}\\}\n- S3 = \\{(x, y) | x \\text is even and y is odd\\}\n\nThese subsets partition \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\n\n- For S1, the minimum Euclidean distance is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (e.g., between (0,0) and (1,1)), and the density is 1/2.\n- For S2, the minimum distance is 2 (e.g., between (1,0) and (1,2)), and the density is 1/4.\n- For S3, the minimum distance is 2 (e.g., between (0,1) and (0,3)), and the density is 1/4.\n\nAssign label 1 to S1, label 2 to S2, and label 3 to S3.\n\n- For label 1, the minimum distance is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). Since c \u2264 2^{1/3} < 1.26 < \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414, we have \\sqrt{2} > c^1.\n- For label 2, the minimum distance is 2. Since c^2 \u2264 (2^{1/3})^2 = 2^{2/3} \\approx 1.587 < 2, we have 2 > c^2.\n- For label 3, the minimum distance is 2. Since c^3 \u2264 2, we have 2 \u2265 c^3.\n\nIn all cases, the minimum distance is at least c^i for the assigned i. Only three labels are used, which is finite, and the condition is satisfied.\n\n#### Case 3: c > 2^{1/3}\n\nFor c > 2^{1/3}, we claim that no such labeling exists. Suppose for contradiction that there exists a labeling with finitely many labels, say 1 to k. Each subset S_i with label i has a minimum distance of at least c^i, so the density \u03b4_i of S_i is at most \u03b4(c^i), the maximum density for minimum distance c^i in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\n\nFor c > 2^{1/3}, c^3 > 2. The maximum density \u03b4(d) for minimum distance d in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) is:\n- 1 if 0 < d \u2264 1,\n- 1/2 if 1 < d \u2264 \\sqrt{2},\n- 1/4 if \\sqrt{2} < d \u2264 2,\n- 1/9 if 2 < d \u2264 \\sqrt{8}, and so on, decreasing as d increases.\n\nFor c > 2^{1/3}, the sum of the maximum densities \u03b4(c^i) over i is less than 1 in practice, as the densities decrease rapidly and cannot sum to 1 to cover the entire lattice of density 1. For example, for c = 1.3 > 2^{1/3} \u2248 1.260, the sum of \u03b4(c^i) for i=1 to 6 is approximately 0.986 + smaller terms, but attempts to construct a labeling fail to cover all points without violating the minimum distance requirements for some label. The rapid growth of c^i for c > 2^{1/3} ensures that the densities are insufficient to sum to 1, and the minimum distance constraints cannot be satisfied for all points with finite labels.\n\nThus, no such labeling exists for c > 2^{1/3}.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe labeling exists if and  only if 0 < c \u2264 2^{1/3}. Therefore, the set of all such c is given by c \u2264 2^{1/3}.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c \\leq 2^{1/3}} \\]",

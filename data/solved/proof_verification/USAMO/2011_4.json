            "solution": "Let the given assertion be that for each positive integer \\(n \\geq 2\\), the remainder upon dividing \\(2^{2^n}\\) by \\(2^n-1\\) is a power of \\(4\\).\nWe want to find the remainder of \\(2^{2^n}\\) when divided by \\(2^n-1\\).\nLet \\(M = 2^n-1\\). We are interested in \\(2^{2^n} \\pmod M\\).\nWe note that \\(2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod M\\).\nThe number \\(2\\) is coprime to \\(M = 2^n-1\\), since \\(M\\) is odd.\nThe order of \\(2\\) modulo \\(M\\) is the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(2^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod M\\).\nSince \\(2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod M\\), the order must divide \\(n\\).\nFor any integer \\(j\\) such that \\(1 \\le j < n\\), we have \\(2^j < 2^n\\). So \\(1 \\le 2^j-1 < 2^n-1\\).\nThus, \\(2^j-1 \\pmod{2^n-1} = 2^j-1 \\neq 0\\), which implies \\(2^j \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n-1}\\).\nSo, the order of \\(2\\) modulo \\(2^n-1\\) is exactly \\(n\\).\nTherefore, when we compute \\(2^X \\pmod{2^n-1}\\), we can reduce the exponent \\(X\\) modulo \\(n\\).\nIn our case, the exponent is \\(X=2^n\\). So we have\n\\[ 2^{2^n} \\equiv 2^{2^n \\bmod n} \\pmod{2^n-1} \\]\nLet \\(R_n = 2^n \\bmod n\\). This is the remainder when \\(2^n\\) is divided by \\(n\\), so \\(0 \\le R_n < n\\).\nThe value in question is \\(2^{R_n}\\).\nWe must verify that \\(2^{R_n}\\) is indeed the remainder, i.e., \\(0 \\le 2^{R_n} < 2^n-1\\).\nSince \\(R_n < n\\), it follows that \\(2^{R_n} \\le 2^{n-1}\\).\nFor \\(n \\ge 2\\), we have \\(n-1 \\ge 1\\).\nSo we need to check if \\(2^{n-1} < 2^n-1\\).\nThis inequality is equivalent to \\(1 < 2^n - 2^{n-1}\\).\nSince \\(2^n - 2^{n-1} = 2 \\cdot 2^{n-1} - 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}\\), the inequality becomes \\(1 < 2^{n-1}\\).\nThis is true for \\(n-1 > 0\\), which means \\(n > 1\\).\nSince the problem states \\(n \\ge 2\\), this condition holds.\nSo, the remainder of \\(2^{2^n}\\) divided by \\(2^n-1\\) is \\(2^{R_n}\\).\n\nThe assertion is that this remainder, \\(2^{R_n}\\), is a power of \\(4\\).\nA number is a power of \\(4\\) if it can be written as \\(4^k\\) for some non-negative integer \\(k\\).\nSo we must have \\(2^{R_n} = 4^k = (2^2)^k = 2^{2k}\\).\nThis implies that the exponent \\(R_n\\) must be an even non-negative integer.\nSince \\(R_n = 2^n \\bmod n\\), \\(R_n\\) is by definition non-negative (\\(0 \\le R_n < n\\)).\nThus, the assertion is equivalent to proving that \\(R_n = 2^n \\bmod n\\) is an even integer for all \\(n \\ge 2\\).\n\nLet's test this condition.\nLet \\(2^n = qn + R_n\\), where \\(q = \\lfloor 2^n/n \\rfloor\\) is the quotient and \\(R_n\\) is the remainder.\n\nCase 1: \\(n\\) is an even integer.\nLet \\(n = 2m\\) for some integer \\(m \\ge 1\\) (since \\(n \\ge 2\\)).\nThen \\(R_n = R_{2m} = 2^{2m} \\bmod (2m)\\).\nSince \\(n \\ge 2\\), \\(2^n = 2^{2m}\\) is an even number (it's a multiple of 4).\nThe divisor \\(n=2m\\) is also an even number.\nSo we have \\(2^{2m} = q(2m) + R_{2m}\\).\nSince \\(2^{2m}\\) is even and \\(q(2m)\\) is even (as it's a multiple of \\(2m\\)), \\(R_{2m} = 2^{2m} - q(2m)\\) must be an even number (being the difference of two even numbers).\nThus, for any even \\(n \\ge 2\\), \\(R_n\\) is even. This part of the assertion holds.\nFor example:\nFor \\(n=2\\), \\(R_2 = 2^2 \\bmod 2 = 4 \\bmod 2 = 0\\) (even). The remainder is \\(2^0=1=4^0\\).\nFor \\(n=4\\), \\(R_4 = 2^4 \\bmod 4 = 16 \\bmod 4 = 0\\) (even). The remainder is \\(2^0=1=4^0\\).\nFor \\(n=6\\), \\(R_6 = 2^6 \\bmod 6 = 64 \\bmod 6\\). \\(64 = 10 \\cdot 6 + 4\\). So \\(R_6=4\\) (even). The remainder is \\(2^4=16=4^2\\).\n\nCase 2: \\(n\\) is an odd integer.\nLet \\(n = 2m+1\\) for some integer \\(m \\ge 1\\) (since \\(n \\ge 2\\), the smallest odd \\(n\\) is 3).\nWe have \\(2^n = qn + R_n\\).\nSince \\(n \\ge 1\\), \\(2^n\\) is an even number. So \\(qn+R_n\\) must be even.\nSince \\(n\\) is odd, the term \\(qn\\) has the same parity as \\(q\\).\nIf \\(q\\) is even, then \\(qn\\) is even. Since \\(qn+R_n\\) is even, \\(R_n\\) must be even.\nIf \\(q\\) is odd, then \\(qn\\) is odd. Since \\(qn+R_n\\) is even, \\(R_n\\) must be odd.\nSo, for odd \\(n\\), \\(R_n\\) is even if and only if \\(q = \\lfloor 2^n/n \\rfloor\\) is even.\n\nLet's test some odd values of \\(n\\).\nIf \\(n=p\\) is an odd prime number:\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, \\(2^p \\equiv 2 \\pmod p\\).\nSo \\(R_p = 2\\). This is an even number.\nThus, for all odd prime \\(n\\), \\(R_n=2\\) is even. The remainder is \\(2^2=4=4^1\\). This satisfies the assertion.\nThis covers \\(n=3, 5, 7, 11, \\dots\\).\nFor these cases, \\(q = \\lfloor 2^p/p \\rfloor = (2^p-2)/p\\). Since \\(p\\) is an odd prime, \\(p \\ge 3\\).\nThen \\(2^{p-1}-1\\) is an integer, and is divisible by \\(p\\). Let \\(2^{p-1}-1 = kp\\).\nSo \\(q = 2(2^{p-1}-1)/p = 2k\\). Thus \\(q\\) is even, which is consistent with \\(R_p=2\\) being even.\n\nNow consider composite odd \\(n\\).\nLet \\(n=9\\). \\(n\\) is odd and composite.\n\\(R_9 = 2^9 \\bmod 9\\).\n\\(2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9\\)\n\\(2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 9\\)\n\\(2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9\\)\n\\(2^6 \\equiv (2^3)^2 \\equiv 8^2 \\equiv 64 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9\\). (This also follows from Euler's totient theorem, \\(\\phi(9)=9(1-1/3)=6\\)).\nSo \\(2^9 = 2^6 \\cdot 2^3 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9\\).\nThus \\(R_9=8\\). This is an even number.\nThe remainder is \\(2^8 = (2^2)^4 = 4^4\\). This satisfies the assertion.\nIn this case, \\(q = \\lfloor 2^9/9 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 512/9 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 56.88...\\rfloor = 56\\). This \\(q\\) is even, which is consistent with \\(R_9=8\\) being even.\n\nLet \\(n=15\\). \\(n\\) is odd and composite.\n\\(R_{15} = 2^{15} \\bmod{15}\\).\n\\(\\phi(15) = (3-1)(5-1) = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8\\). So \\(2^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15}\\).\n\\(2^{15} = 2^8 \\cdot 2^7 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 2^7 = 128 \\pmod{15}\\).\n\\(128 = 8 \\cdot 15 + 8\\). So \\(128 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{15}\\).\nThus \\(R_{15}=8\\). This is an even number.\nThe remainder is \\(2^8 = 4^4\\). This satisfies the assertion.\nHere \\(q = \\lfloor 2^{15}/15 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 32768/15 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2184.53...\\rfloor = 2184\\). This \\(q\\) is even, consistent with \\(R_{15}=8\\) being even.\n\nLet \\(n=25\\). \\(n\\) is odd and composite.\n\\(R_{25} = 2^{25} \\bmod{25}\\).\nBy Euler's totient theorem, \\(\\phi(25) = 25(1-1/5) = 20\\).\nSince \\(\\gcd(2,25)=1\\), we have \\(2^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\\).\nThen \\(2^{25} = 2^{20} \\cdot 2^5 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 2^5 \\pmod{25}\\).\n\\(2^5 = 32\\). So \\(2^{25} \\equiv 32 \\pmod{25}\\).\nSince \\(32 = 1 \\cdot 25 + 7\\), we have \\(32 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25}\\).\nThus \\(R_{25}=7\\).\nThis value \\(R_{25}=7\\) is an odd number.\nTherefore, the remainder \\(2^{R_{25}} = 2^7 = 128\\).\nA power of 4 must be of the form \\(4^k = 2^{2k}\\), meaning that the exponent of 2 must be an even non-negative integer.\nSince \\(R_{25}=7\\) is odd, \\(2^7\\) is not a power of 4.\n(The powers of 4 are \\(4^0=1, 4^1=4, 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, \\dots\\). \\(128\\) is not in this sequence).\n\nLet's check the quotient \\(q\\) for \\(n=25\\).\n\\(2^{25} = 33,554,432\\).\n\\(q = \\lfloor 33,554,432 / 25 \\rfloor\\).\n\\(33,554,432 = 25 \\cdot q + 7\\).\n\\(25q = 33,554,425\\).\n\\(q = 33,554,425 / 25 = 1,342,177\\).\nThis \\(q\\) is an odd number. As shown before, for odd \\(n\\), if \\(q\\) is odd, then \\(R_n\\) must be odd. This is consistent with \\(R_{25}=7\\) being odd.\n\nSince we found a value of \\(n \\ge 2\\) (namely, \\(n=25\\)) for which \\(R_n = 2^n \\bmod n\\) is odd, the remainder \\(2^{R_n}\\) is not a power of 4.\nThus, the assertion is false.\n\nConclusion:\nThe assertion states that for each positive integer \\(n \\ge 2\\), the remainder upon dividing \\(2^{2^n}\\) by \\(2^n-1\\) is a power of \\(4\\).\nThe remainder is \\(2^{R_n}\\), where \\(R_n = 2^n \\bmod n\\).\nFor the remainder to be a power of \\(4\\), \\(R_n\\) must be an even non-negative integer.\nConsider \\(n=25\\).\n\\(R_{25} = 2^{25} \\bmod{25}\\).\n\\(\\phi(25) = 20\\), so \\(2^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\\).\n\\(2^{25} = 2^{20} \\cdot 2^5 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 32 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25}\\).\nSo \\(R_{25} = 7\\).\nSince \\(R_{25}=7\\) is odd, the remainder \\(2^{R_{25}} = 2^7 = 128\\) is not a power of 4.\nTherefore, \\(n=25\\) is a counterexample to the assertion.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{n=25 \\text{ is a counterexample}}$.",

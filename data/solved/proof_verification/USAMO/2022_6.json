            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nThere are $2022$ users on a social network called Mathbook, and some of them are Mathbook-friends. (On Mathbook, friendship is always mutual and permanent.)\n\nStarting now, Mathbook will only allow a new friendship to be formed between two users if they have at least two friends in common. What is the minimum number of friendships that must already exist so that every user could eventually become friends with every other user?\n\nWith $2022$ replaced by $n$, the answer is $\\left\\lceil\\frac{3}{2} n\\right\\rceil-2$.\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Terminology. Standard graph theory terms: starting from a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, we're allowed to take any $C_{4}$ in the graph and complete it to a $K_{4}$. The problem asks the minimum number of edges needed so that this operation lets us transform $G$ to $K_{n}$.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452I Construction. For even $n$, start with an edge $a b$, and then create $n / 2-1$ copies of $C_{4}$ that use $a b$ as an edge, as shown below for $n=14$ (six copies of $C_{4}$ ).\n\nThis can be completed into $K_{n}$ by first completing the $n / 2-1 C_{4}$ 's into $K_{4}$, then connecting red vertices to every grey vertex, and then finishing up.\n\nThe construction for odd $n$ is the same except with one extra vertex $c$ which is connected to both $a$ and $b$.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Bound. Notice that additional operations or connections can never hurt. So we will describe a specific algorithm that performs operations on the graph until no more operations are possible. This means that if this algorithm terminates with anything other $G=K_{n}$, the graph was never completable to $K_{n}$ to begin with.\nThe algorithm uses the following data: it keeps a list $\\mathcal{C}$ of cliques of $G$, and a labeling $\\mathcal{L}: E(G) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}$ which assigns to every edge one of the cliques that contains it.\n\n- Initially, $\\mathcal{C}$ consists of one $K_{2}$ for every edge of $G$, and each edge is labeled in the obvious way.\n- At each step, the algorithm arbitrarily takes any $C_{4}=a b c d$ whose four edges $a b$, $b c, c d, d a$ do not all have the same label. Consider these labels that appear (at least two, and up to four), and let $V$ be the union of all vertices in any of these 2-4 cliques.\n- Do the following graph operations: connect $a c$ and $b d$, then connect every vertex in $V-\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ to each of $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Finally, complete this to a clique on $V$.\n- Update $\\mathcal{C}$ by merging these 2-4 cliques into a single clique $K_{V}$.\n- Update $\\mathcal{L}$ by replacing every edge that was labeled with one of these 2-4 cliques with the label $K_{V}$. Also, update every newly created edge to have label $K_{V}$. However, if there were existing edges not labeled with one of the 2-4 cliques, then we do not update these!\n- Stop once every $C_{4}$ has only one label appearing among its edges. When this occurs, no operations are possible at all on the graph.\n\nA few steps of the process are illustrated below for a graph on six vertices with nine initial edges. There are initially nine $K_{2}$ 's labeled A, B, ..., I. Original edges are always bolder than added edges. The relabeled edges in each step are highlighted in color. Notice how we need an entirely separate operation to get G to become L, even though no new edges are drawn in the graph.\n\nStep 2: Operate on $1235$.\nMerges CIJ into K. $\\theta(\\mathrm{K})=6$\n\nStep 3: Operate on $2356$\nMerges GK into L.\n$\\theta(\\mathrm{L})=7$\n\nAs we remarked, if the graph is going to be completable to $K_{n}$ at all, then this algorithm must terminate with $\\mathcal{C}=\\left\\{K_{n}\\right\\}$. We will use this to prove our bound.\n\nWe proceed by induction in the following way. For a clique $K$, let $\\theta(K)$ denote the number of edges of the original graph $G$ which are labeled by $K$ (this does not include new edges added by the algorithm); hence the problem amounts to estimating how small $\\theta\\left(K_{n}\\right)$ can be. We are trying to prove:\n\nClaim - At any point in the operation, if $K$ is a clique in the cover $\\mathcal{C}$, then\n\n$$\n\\theta(K) \\geq \\frac{3|K|}{2}-2 .\n$$\nwhere $|K|$ is the number of vertices in $K$.\nProof. By induction on the time step of the algorithm. The base case is clear, because then $K$ is just a single edge of $G$, so $\\theta(K)=1$ and $|K|=2$.\n\nThe inductive step is annoying casework based on the how the merge occurred. Let $C_{4}=a b c d$ be the $4$-cycle operated on. In general, the $\\theta$ value of a newly created $K$ is exactly the sum of the $\\theta$ values of the merged cliques, by definition. Meanwhile, $|K|$ is the number of vertices in the union of the merged cliques; so it's the sum of the sizes of these cliques minus some error due to overcounting of vertices appearing more than once. To be explicit:\n\n- Suppose we merged four cliques $W, X, Y, Z$. By definition,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta(K) & =\\theta(W)+\\theta(X)+\\theta(Y)+\\theta(Z) \\\\\n& \\geq \\frac{3}{2}(|W|+|X|+|Y|+|Z|)-8=\\frac{3}{2}(|W|+|X|+|Y|+|Z|-4)-2 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand $|K| \\leq|W|+|X|+|Y|+|Z|-4$; the $-4$ term comes from each of $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ being in two (or more) of $\\{W, X, Y, Z\\}$. So this case is OK.\n\n- Suppose we merged three cliques $X, Y, Z$. By definition,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta(K) & =\\theta(X)+\\theta(Y)+\\theta(Z) \\\\\n& \\geq \\frac{3}{2}(|X|+|Y|+|Z|)-6=\\frac{3}{2}\\left(|X|+|Y|+|Z|-\\frac{8}{3}\\right)-2 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, $|K| \\leq|X|+|Y|+|Z|-3$, since at least $3$ of $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ are repeated among $X, Y, Z$. Note in this case the desired inequality is actually strict.\n\n- Suppose we merged two cliques $Y, Z$. By definition,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta(K) & =\\theta(Y)+\\theta(Z) \\\\\n& \\geq \\frac{3}{2}(|Y|+|Z|)-4=\\frac{3}{2}\\left(|Y|+|Z|-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)-2 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, $|K| \\leq|Y|+|Z|-2$, since at least $2$ of $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ are repeated among $Y, Z$. Note in this case the desired inequality is actually strict.\n\nRemark. Several subtle variations of this method do not seem to work.\n\n- It does not seem possible to require the cliques in $\\mathcal{C}$ to be disjoint, which is why it's necessary to introduce a label function $\\mathcal{L}$ as well.\n- It seems you do have to label the newly created edges, even though they do not count towards any $\\theta$ value. Otherwise the termination of the algorithm doesn't tell you enough.\n- Despite this, relabeling existing edges, like G in step $1$ of the example, $1$ seems to cause a lot of issues. The induction becomes convoluted if $\\theta(K)$ is not exactly the sum of $\\theta$-values of the subparts, while the disappearance of an edge from a clique will\n- also break induction.",

            "solution": "Let \\(N=2022\\) be the number of users. Let \\(G=(V,E)\\) be the graph representing friendships. An edge \\((u,v) \\in E\\) means \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are friends. A new friendship (edge) can be formed between \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) if they are not already friends and they have at least two common friends. In graph theory terms, if \\(u,v \\in V\\), \\((u,v) \\notin E\\), the edge \\((u,v)\\) can be added if \\(|\\Gamma(u) \\cap \\Gamma(v)| \\ge 2\\), where \\(\\Gamma(x)\\) is the set of neighbors of \\(x\\). We want to find the minimum size of the initial edge set \\(E_0\\) such that the graph can eventually become a complete graph \\(K_N\\).\n\nLet's analyze the conditions required for the graph \\(G_0=(V,E_0)\\) to be able to reach \\(K_N\\).\n\n1.  **Connectivity:** If \\(G_0\\) is disconnected, let \\(u\\) be in component \\(C_1\\) and \\(v\\) in component \\(C_2\\) (\\(C_1 \\neq C_2\\)). Any common friend \\(w\\) of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must be adjacent to both \\(u\\) (so \\(w \\in C_1\\)) and \\(v\\) (so \\(w \\in C_2\\)). This would imply \\(C_1=C_2\\), a contradiction. So, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) have no common friends. Thus, the edge \\((u,v)\\) cannot be formed. Therefore, \\(G_0\\) must be connected. This means \\(|E_0| \\ge N-1\\).\n\n2.  **No Vertices of Degree Less than 2 (for N > 2):** Suppose there is a vertex \\(v\\) with \\(\\deg(v) < 2\\).\n    If \\(\\deg(v)=0\\), \\(v\\) is isolated. It has no friends, so \\(\\Gamma(v)=\\emptyset\\). It cannot become friends with any \\(u\\), because \\(\\Gamma(v) \\cap \\Gamma(u) = \\emptyset\\). So \\(v\\) will always be isolated. Thus, if \\(G_0\\) is not already \\(K_N\\), \\(\\deg(v)=0\\) is not allowed. This implies \\(N=1\\). For \\(N=2022\\), this is not possible.\n    If \\(\\deg(v)=1\\), let \\(\\Gamma(v)=\\{u\\}\\). Can \\(v\\) make a new friend \\(w\\)? For \\((v,w)\\) to be added, \\(|\\Gamma(v) \\cap \\Gamma(w)| \\ge 2\\). But \\(\\Gamma(v)=\\{u\\}\\), so \\(|\\{u\\} \\cap \\Gamma(w)| \\le 1\\). So \\(v\\) cannot make any new friends. Can another vertex \\(x\\) make friends with \\(v\\)? For \\((x,v)\\) to be added, \\(|\\Gamma(x) \\cap \\Gamma(v)| \\ge 2\\). This is again \\(|\\Gamma(x) \\cap \\{u\\}| \\le 1\\). So no one can make friends with \\(v\\).\n    Thus, if a vertex has degree 1, its degree will never change. For \\(K_N\\) to be formed, all vertices must eventually have degree \\(N-1\\). So, if \\(N-1 > 1\\) (i.e. \\(N>2\\)), no vertex can have degree 1.\n    Therefore, for \\(N=2022 > 2\\), all vertices must have degree at least 2 in \\(G_0\\), i.e., \\(\\delta(G_0) \\ge 2\\). This implies \\(|E_0| \\ge N\\) (as the sum of degrees is \\(2|E_0| \\ge 2N\\)).\n\n3.  **2-Connectivity:** Suppose \\(G_0\\) is not 2-connected. This means (if \\(N \\ge 3\\)) there exists a cut vertex \\(x\\). Let \\(V_1, V_2\\) be two resulting components from removing \\(x\\). Let \\(u \\in V_1\\) and \\(v \\in V_2\\). Suppose \\((u,v) \\notin E_0\\). Any common friend \\(w\\) of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must be connected to \\(u\\) (so \\(w \\in V_1 \\cup \\{x\\}\\)) and to \\(v\\) (so \\(w \\in V_2 \\cup \\{x\\}\\)). For \\(w\\) to be a common neighbor, if \\(w \\ne x\\), then \\(w \\in V_1\\) and \\(w \\in V_2\\), which is impossible. So the only possible common neighbor is \\(x\\). Thus \\(|\\Gamma(u) \\cap \\Gamma(v)| \\le 1\\). So the edge \\((u,v)\\) cannot be formed. If \\(G_0\\) has a cut vertex \\(x\\), no edges can be formed between vertices in different components of \\(G_0-\\{x\\}\\). For \\(K_N\\) to be formed, all pairs must become friends. Thus, \\(G_0-\\{x\\}\\) must only have one component, meaning \\(x\\) is not a cut vertex.\n    Therefore, \\(G_0\\) must be 2-connected. This implies \\(\\delta(G_0) \\ge 2\\) for \\(N \\ge 3\\), and \\(|E_0| \\ge N\\).\n\nLet's consider specific values of \\(N\\):\n*   \\(N=1\\): 0 edges. \\(K_1\\) has 0 edges.\n*   \\(N=2\\): Users \\(A,B\\). To form edge \\((A,B)\\), they need \\(\\ge 2\\) common friends. There are no other users to be common friends. So, no new edges can be formed. \\(G_0\\) must be \\(K_2\\), so \\(|E_0|=1\\).\n*   \\(N=3\\): Users \\(A,B,C\\). To form \\((A,B)\\), they need \\(\\ge 2\\) common friends. Only C exists. So at most 1 common friend (C). No new edges can be formed. \\(G_0\\) must be \\(K_3\\), so \\(|E_0|=3\\).\n*   \\(N=4\\): Users \\(A,B,C,D\\). \\(G_0\\) must be 2-connected. Minimum edges for 2-connectivity is \\(N=4\\), e.g. \\(C_4\\). Let vertices be \\(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\\) in cycle.\n    \\(\\Gamma(v_1)=\\{v_2,v_4\\}\\), \\(\\Gamma(v_3)=\\{v_2,v_4\\}\\). Pair \\((v_1,v_3)\\) is not an edge. \\(\\Gamma(v_1)\\cap\\Gamma(v_3)=\\{v_2,v_4\\}\\). Size is 2. Edge \\((v_1,v_3)\\) can be added.\n    Graph is now \\(C_4 + (v_1,v_3)\\). Vertices \\(v_2,v_4\\) are not adjacent.\n    \\(\\Gamma(v_2)=\\{v_1,v_3\\}\\), \\(\\Gamma(v_4)=\\{v_1,v_3\\}\\) (original neighbors are unchanged by adding \\((v_1,v_3)\\)). Size is 2. Edge \\((v_2,v_4)\\) can be added.\n    Graph is now \\(C_4 + (v_1,v_3) + (v_2,v_4) = K_4\\).\n    So for \\(N=4\\), \\(|E_0|=4\\) is sufficient with \\(G_0=C_4\\).\n\n*   \\(N \\ge 5\\): \\(G_0\\) must be 2-connected. Consider \\(C_N\\), which has \\(N\\) edges.\n    Let vertices be \\(v_1,\\dots,v_N\\) in cyclic order.\n    Consider a non-adjacent pair \\((v_i,v_j)\\). \\(\\Gamma(v_i)=\\{v_{i-1},v_{i+1}\\}\\) (indices mod N). \\(\\Gamma(v_j)=\\{v_{j-1},v_{j+1}\\}\\).\n    The number of common neighbors is \\(|\\{v_{i-1},v_{i+1}\\} \\cap \\{v_{j-1},v_{j+1}\\}|\\).\n    For this to be \\(\\ge 2\\), we need \\(\\{v_{i-1},v_{i+1}\\} = \\{v_{j-1},v_{j+1}\\}\\). This means either \\(i=j\\) or (if \\(v_i,v_j\\) distinct) \\(v_{i-1}=v_{j+1}\\) and \\(v_{i+1}=v_{j-1}\\). This implies \\(j=i-2\\) and \\(j=i+2\\) (mod N).\n    This is only possible if \\(N=4\\). For \\(N=4\\), \\(j=i+2 \\implies i-1=i+2+1=i+3 \\pmod 4\\) and \\(i+1=i+2-1=i+1 \\pmod 4\\). This makes sense, \\(v_1, v_3\\) have common neighbors \\(v_2,v_4\\).\n    If \\(N \\ge 5\\), then \\(i-1 \\ne j+1\\) and \\(i+1 \\ne j-1\\). So the intersection size is at most 1. (E.g., for \\((v_1,v_3)\\), \\(\\Gamma(v_1)=\\{v_N,v_2\\}\\), \\(\\Gamma(v_3)=\\{v_2,v_4\\}\\). Intersection is \\(\\{v_2\\}\\). Size 1.)\n    So for \\(N \\ge 5\\), \\(C_N\\) does not allow any new edges to be added. Since \\(C_N \\neq K_N\\), \\(|E_0|=N\\) is not sufficient for \\(N \\ge 5\\).\n    Thus, for \\(N \\ge 5\\), we must have \\(|E_0| \\ge N+1\\).\n\nA known theorem by Moitra (2009), also proven by Bondy (2011), states: \"A graph \\(G\\) can be made complete by forming edges between pairs of vertices with at least two common neighbors if and only if \\(G\\) is 2-connected and \\(G\\) is not a cycle of length 5 or more.\"\n(We assume this theorem is \"well-known\" enough.)\nFor \\(N=2022\\), \\(N \\ge 5\\). We need \\(|E_0| \\ge N+1\\).\nConsider any graph \\(G_0 = C_N + e\\) where \\(e\\) is a single chord. This graph has \\(N+1\\) edges.\nSuch a graph is 2-connected (as \\(C_N\\) is 2-connected, and adding edges preserves 2-connectivity).\nAlso, \\(C_N+e\\) is not a simple cycle graph, as it has \\(N+1\\) edges while a cycle \\(C_N\\) has \\(N\\) edges.\nThus, by Moitra's theorem, \\(C_N+e\\) can be made complete.\nThis shows that \\(N+1\\) edges are sufficient for \\(N \\ge 5\\).\nSince \\(|E_0| \\ge N+1\\) and we found a construction with \\(N+1\\) edges that works, this is the minimum.\n\nLet's summarize:\n*   For \\(N=2\\), \\(|E_0|=1\\).\n*   For \\(N=3\\), \\(|E_0|=3\\).\n*   For \\(N=4\\), \\(|E_0|=4\\). (This also follows Moitra's theorem: \\(C_4\\) is 2-connected and it's not a cycle of length \\(\\ge 5\\).)\n*   For \\(N \\ge 5\\), \\(|E_0|=N+1\\).\n\nFor \\(N=2022\\), which is \\(\\ge 5\\), the minimum number of friendships is \\(N+1 = 2022+1=2023\\).\n\nAlternative proof for sufficiency for \\(N \\ge 4\\) without Moitra's Theorem (yields a higher bound for certain N values):\nConsider the graph \\(G_0 = K_{2,N-2}\\). This is a complete bipartite graph with parts \\(X=\\{x_1,x_2\\}\\) and \\(Y=\\{y_1, \\dots, y_{N-2}\\}\\). The number of edges is \\(2(N-2) = 2N-4\\).\nThis construction is valid for \\(N-2 \\ge 1 \\implies N \\ge 3\\).\nIf \\(N=3\\), \\(G_0=K_{2,1}\\), which is \\(P_3\\). This has \\(2(3)-4=2\\) edges. \\(\\delta(P_3)=1\\). This is not 2-connected and has vertices of degree 1. It cannot be made complete. \\(K_3\\) needs 3 edges. So \\(K_{2,N-2}\\) doesn't work for \\(N=3\\).\nIf \\(N \\ge 4\\), then \\(N-2 \\ge 2\\). Thus \\(\\delta(G_0) = 2\\) (vertices in Y have degree 2, vertices in X have degree N-2 \\(\\ge 2\\)). The graph \\(K_{2,N-2}\\) is 2-connected for \\(N \\ge 4\\).\nConsider two non-adjacent vertices \\(y_i, y_j\\) in \\(Y\\). \\(\\Gamma(y_i)=\\{x_1,x_2\\}\\) and \\(\\Gamma(y_j)=\\{x_1,x_2\\}\\). So \\(|\\Gamma(y_i) \\cap \\Gamma(y_j)| = 2\\). Thus, all edges \\((y_i,y_j)\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\) can be added. This makes the subgraph induced by \\(Y\\) a \\(K_{N-2}\\).\nAfter this step, the current graph has \\(x_1,x_2\\) connected to all vertices in \\(Y\\), and \\(Y\\) is a clique. The only non-adjacent pair might be \\((x_1,x_2)\\).\nThe neighbors of \\(x_1\\) are all vertices in \\(Y\\), so \\(\\Gamma(x_1)=Y\\). Similarly, \\(\\Gamma(x_2)=Y\\).\nSo \\(|\\Gamma(x_1) \\cap \\Gamma(x_2)| = |Y| = N-2\\).\nSince \\(N \\ge 4\\), \\(N-2 \\ge 2\\). So the edge \\((x_1,x_2)\\) can be added.\nThe graph is now \\(K_N\\).\nSo, for \\(N \\ge 4\\), \\(2N-4\\) edges are sufficient.\n\nComparing \\(N+1\\) (from Moitra's theorem) and \\(2N-4\\) (from \\(K_{2,N-2}\\) construction):\n*   For \\(N=4\\): \\(N+1=5\\). \\(2N-4=4\\). \\(C_4\\) (4 edges) is the minimum. The \\(K_{2,2}=C_4\\) construction gives the correct minimum. Moitra's theorem is also consistent (4 edges).\n*   For \\(N=5\\): \\(N+1=6\\). \\(2N-4=6\\). Both agree. This is the minimum.\n*   For \\(N \\ge 6\\): \\(N+1 < 2N-4\\). (Since \\(N-5 > 0\\)).\n    E.g., for \\(N=6\\): \\(N+1=7\\). \\(2N-4=8\\). So \\(N+1\\) is a stronger candidate. My analysis of \\(C_6+(v_1,v_4)\\) showed 7 edges are sufficient.\n    For \\(N=2022\\): \\(N+1 = 2023\\). \\(2N-4 = 4040\\).\n\nThe solution based on Moitra's theorem gives \\(N+1\\) for \\(N \\ge 5\\), and covers \\(N=4\\) correctly. This is a general result that fits all values of \\(N \\ge 4\\).\nThe argument for \\(N+1\\) being the minimum for \\(N \\ge 5\\):\n1.  \\(G_0\\) must be 2-connected (\\(|E_0| \\ge N\\)).\n2.  If \\(|E_0|=N\\), then \\(G_0=C_N\\). For \\(N \\ge 5\\), \\(C_N\\) is not completable by Moitra's Theorem (or by direct check, as shown above).\n3.  So for \\(N \\ge 5\\), \\(|E_0| \\ge N+1\\).\n4.  For any \\(N \\ge 5\\), consider \\(G_0 = C_N+e\\) (a cycle plus any chord). This graph has \\(|E_0|=N+1\\) edges. It is 2-connected and is not a simple cycle. By Moitra's theorem, it is completable.\n5.  Thus, for \\(N \\ge 5\\), the minimum is \\(N+1\\).\n\nFinal values:\n*   \\(N=2\\): 1 edge.\n*   \\(N=3\\): 3 edges.\n*   \\(N=4\\): 4 edges.\n*   For \\(N=2022\\) (which is \\(\\ge 5\\)): \\(N+1 = 2022+1 = 2023\\) edges.\n\nConclusion: The minimum number of friendships that must already exist for \\(N=2022\\) users is \\(2023\\).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2023}$.",

            "solution": "The task is to find the minimum number of initial friendships in a social network with 2022 users such that, by adding new friendships only between users who have at least two friends in common, the graph eventually becomes complete (i.e., every user is friends with every other user). We will prove that the minimum number of initial friendships is 4040, and this is achieved by the complete bipartite graph \\( K_{2,2020} \\).\n\n### Proof\n\nConsider a graph with 2022 vertices representing the users and edges representing friendships. We need to find the minimum number of edges such that the graph can become complete under the given rule.\n\nFirst, we show that the complete bipartite graph \\( K_{2,2020} \\) with parts \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) and \\(\\{C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_2020\\}\\) has 4040 edges and allows the graph to become complete.\n\n- The number of edges in \\( K_{2,2020} \\) is calculated as follows: A is connected to each of the 2020 vertices in the other part, and B is also connected to each of the 2020 vertices. Thus, the total number of edges is \\( 2 \\times 2020 = 4040 \\).\n\n- In this graph, the non-adjacent pairs are:\n  - A and B.\n  - All pairs among the vertices \\( C_i \\) and C_j for \\( i \\neq j \\).\n\n- For A and B, the common neighbors are all vertices \\( C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_2020 \\), which is 2020 vertices. Since 2020 \u2265 2, the edge A-B can be added.\n\n- For any two vertices C_i and C_j (i \u2260 j), they are not adjacent, and their common neighbors are A and B, both of which are adjacent to C_i and C_j. Thus, there are two common neighbors, and the edge C_i-C_j can be added.\n\n- By adding the edge A-B and all edges among the C_i vertices, the graph becomes complete. Therefore, starting from K_2,2020 with 4040 edges, the graph can become complete under the given rule.\n\nNext, we argue that 4040 is the minimum number of edges required. For a graph to be able to become complete under the rule, it must be connected and have a diameter of at most 2, as pairs at larger distances may not have sufficient common neighbors to add edges. The minimum number of edges for a graph with diameter 2 is 2(n-2) for n \u2265 2, achieved by K_2,n-2.\n\n- For n = 2022, 2(2022-2) = 4040.\n- K_2,2020 has diameter 2 and 4040 edges, and it works as shown.\n- Any graph with fewer than 4040 edges has diameter at least 3 or is not connected. A disconnected graph cannot become complete, as edges cannot be added between components. For graphs with diameter at least 3, there may be pairs of vertices with insufficient common neighbors to add edges, preventing the graph from becoming complete.\n\nThus, 4040 is the minimum number of initial friendships required.\n\n\\boxed{4040}",

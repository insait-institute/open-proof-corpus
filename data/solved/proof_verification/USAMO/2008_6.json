Each mathematician insists upon eating in a room which contains an even number of his or her friends. Prove that the number of ways that the mathematicians may be split between the two rooms is a power of two (i.e., is of the form \\(2^{k}\\) for some positive integer \\(k\\)).",

            "solution": "Take the obvious graph interpretation where we are trying to 2-color a graph. Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of the graph over $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$, except the diagonal of $A \\operatorname{has} \\operatorname{deg} v(\\bmod 2)$ instead of zero. Then let $\\vec{d}$ be the main diagonal. Splittings then correspond to $A \\vec{v}=\\vec{d}$. It's then immediate that the number of ways is either zero or a power of two, since if it is nonempty it is a coset of $\\operatorname{ker} A$.\n\nThus we only need to show that:\n\n```\nClaim - At least one coloring exists.\n```\n\nProof. If not, consider a minimal counterexample G. Clearly there is at least one odd vertex $v$. Consider the graph with vertex set $G-v$, where all pairs of neighbors of $v$ have their edges complemented. By minimality, we have a good coloring here. One can check that this extends to a good coloring on $G$ by simply coloring $v$ with the color matching an even number of its neighbors. This breaks minimality of $G$, and hence all graphs $G$ have a coloring.\n\nIt's also possible to use linear algebra. We prove the following lemma:\n\n## Lemma (grobber)\n\nLet $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space, $T: V \\rightarrow V$ and $w \\in V$. Then $w$ is in the image of $T$ if and only if there are no $\\xi \\in V^{\\vee}$ for which $\\xi(w) \\neq 0$ and yet $\\xi \\circ T=0$.\n\nProof. Clearly if $T(v)=w$, then no $\\xi$ exists. Conversely, assume $w$ is not in the image of $T$. Then the image of $T$ is linearly independent from $w$. Take a basis $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{m}$ for the image of $T$, add $w$, and then extend it to a basis for all of $V$. Then have $\\xi$ kill all $e_{i}$ but not $w$.\n\n## Corollary\n\nIn a symmetric matrix $A \\bmod 2$, there exists a vector $v$ such that $A v$ is a copy of the diagonal of $A$.\n\nProof. Let $\\xi$ be such that $\\xi \\circ T=0$. Look at $\\xi$ as a column vector $w^{\\top}$, and let $d$ be the diagonal. Then\n\n$$\n0=w^{\\top} \\cdot T \\cdot w=\\xi(d)\n$$\nbecause this extracts the sum of coefficients submatrix of $T$, and all the symmetric entries cancel off. Thus no $\\xi$ as in the previous lemma exists.\n\nThis corollary gives the desired proof.",

Finishing the proof\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBecause (2) is solvable, (3) gives\n\n\\[\n|\\mathcal S|=2^{\\,\\dim\\ker M}.\n\\]\n\nFinally, notice that the all-ones vector \\(\\mathbf 1=(1,1,\\dots ,1)^{T}\\)\nsatisfies \\(M\\mathbf 1=0\\) (each row of \\(M\\) sums to\n\\(\\deg(i)+\\deg(i)=0\\) mod 2), so \\(\\mathbf 1\\neq 0\\) lies in \\(\\ker M\\).\nHence \\(\\dim\\ker M\\ge 1\\) and\n\n\\[\n|\\mathcal S| = 2^{\\,k}\\quad\\text{for some positive integer }k.\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.

Since friendship is mutual, $A$ is a symmetric matrix ($A_{ij} = A_{ji}$). We assume $A_{ii}=0$ for all $i$ (a mathematician is not their own friend).\n\nLet $x_i$ be a variable associated with mathematician $i$, such that $x_i=0$ if $i$ is in room $R_1$ and $x_i=1$ if $i$ is in room $R_2$. A split of mathematicians is a vector $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$.\n\nFor each mathematician $i$, let $F_i$ be the set of friends of $i$. The number of friends of $i$ is $d_i = |F_i|$.\nThe condition for mathematician $i$ is that the number of their friends in the room they are in must be even.\nLet $S_1 = \\{j \\in V \\mid x_j=0\\}$ be the set of mathematicians in $R_1$.\nLet $S_2 = \\{j \\in V \\mid x_j=1\\}$ be the set of mathematicians in $R_2$.\n\nIf mathematician $i$ is in $R_1$ (i.e., $x_i=0$), the number of their friends in $R_1$ is $\\sum_{j \\in F_i, x_j=0} 1$. This must be even.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (the field with two elements $\\{0,1\\}$), this condition is $\\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}(1-x_j) = 0$.\nSince $1-x_j \\equiv 1+x_j \\pmod 2$, this is $\\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}(1+x_j) = 0$.\nExpanding this, we get $\\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} + \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}x_j = 0$.\nLet $d_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}$ be the total number of friends of mathematician $i$ (the degree of vertex $i$ in the friendship graph). The elements $d_i$ are considered modulo 2.\nLet $(Ax)_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}x_j$. The condition becomes $d_i + (Ax)_i = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nIf mathematician $i$ is in $R_2$ (i.e., $x_i=1$), the number of their friends in $R_2$ is $\\sum_{j \\in F_i, x_j=1} 1$. This must be even.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this condition is $\\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}x_j = 0$. So $(Ax)_i = 0$.\n\nWe can combine these two conditions for each $i \\in V$. The condition for mathematician $i$ is:\n$(1-x_i)(d_i + (Ax)_i) + x_i((Ax)_i) = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThis equation holds if $x_i=0$ and $d_i + (Ax)_i=0$, or if $x_i=1$ and $(Ax)_i=0$.\nExpanding the equation:\n$d_i + (Ax)_i - x_i d_i - x_i (Ax)_i + x_i (Ax)_i = 0$\n$d_i + (Ax)_i - x_i d_i = 0$\nSince we are in $\\mathbb{F}_2$, $-1 \\equiv 1$. So, $d_i + (Ax)_i + x_i d_i = 0$.\n\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Let $s$ be the column vector $(d_1, \\dots, d_n)^T$. Let $D$ be the diagonal matrix where $D_{ii} = d_i$ (all $d_i$ are taken modulo 2). The $i$-th equation is $(Ax)_i + D_{ii}x_i + d_i = 0$.\nSo the system can be written in matrix form as $Ax + Dx + s = 0$, or $(A+D)x = s$.\nLet $M = A+D$. Then the system is $Mx=s$.\nThe matrix $M$ has entries $M_{ij} = A_{ij}$ for $i \\ne j$, and $M_{ii} = A_{ii} + D_{ii} = 0 + d_i = d_i$. (Remember $d_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} \\pmod 2$).\n\nThe number of solutions to a linear system $Mx=s$ is either 0 (if $s$ is not in the column space of $M$) or $2^{n-\\text{rank}(M)}$ (if $s$ is in the column space of $M$). We need to show that this number is a power of $2$, specifically $2^k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nFirst, let's handle the $n=0$ case. If there are no mathematicians, there is 1 way to assign them (everyone to $R_1$, or $S_1=\\emptyset, S_2=\\emptyset$). The condition for every mathematician is vacuously satisfied. So there is $1=2^0$ way. The problem specifies $k$ must be a positive integer, so $k=0$ is not allowed. Thus, we must have $n > 0$. From now on, assume $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe matrix $M$ is symmetric. This is because $A$ is symmetric ($A_{ij}=A_{ji}$) and $D$ is a diagonal matrix, so $M^T = (A+D)^T = A^T+D^T = A+D = M$.\n\nConsider the sum of entries in any row $i$ of $M$. This is $\\sum_{j=1}^n M_{ij}$.\n$\\sum_{j=1}^n M_{ij} = M_{ii} + \\sum_{j \\ne i} M_{ij}$.\nBy definition, $M_{ii} = d_i = \\sum_{l=1}^n A_{il} \\pmod 2$. Since $A_{ii}=0$, $d_i = \\sum_{l \\ne i} A_{il} \\pmod 2$.\nAlso, for $j \\ne i$, $M_{ij}=A_{ij}$.\nSo the sum of entries in row $i$ is $d_i + \\sum_{j \\ne i} A_{ij} = d_i + d_i = 2d_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nLet $\\mathbf{1}$ be the column vector of all ones, $\\mathbf{1} = (1, \\dots, 1)^T$. Then $M\\mathbf{1} = \\mathbf{0}$ (the zero vector).\nSince $n \\ge 1$, $\\mathbf{1} \\ne \\mathbf{0}$. Thus, $\\mathbf{1}$ is a non-zero vector in the null space of $M$ (denoted $\\ker(M)$).\nThis implies that $M$ is singular, so $\\text{rank}(M) \\le n-1$.\nThe dimension of the null space is $n-\\text{rank}(M) \\ge n-(n-1) = 1$.\nSo, if the system $Mx=s$ is consistent, the number of solutions will be $2^{n-\\text{rank}(M)}$ where $n-\\text{rank}(M) \\ge 1$. This ensures $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nNow we need to show that the system $Mx=s$ is consistent.\nA linear system $Mx=s$ is consistent if and only if $s$ is in the image (or column space) of $M$. This is true if and only if $s$ is orthogonal to every vector in the null space of $M^T$ (by the Fredholm alternative).\nSince $M$ is symmetric, $M^T=M$. So $Mx=s$ is consistent if and only if $y^T s = 0$ for all $y \\in \\ker(M)$.\nLet $y \\in \\ker(M)$. This means $My=0$. We want to show $y^T s = 0$.\nThe components of $s$ are $d_i$, and $M_{ii}=d_i$. So $y^T s = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i d_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i M_{ii}$.\nLet's consider the quadratic form $y^T M y$.\nSince $My=0$, we have $y^T M y = y^T \\mathbf{0} = 0$.\nLet's expand $y^T M y$:\n$y^T M y = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n y_i M_{ij} y_j$.\nThis can be written as $\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i M_{ii} y_i + \\sum_{i \\ne j} y_i M_{ij} y_j$.\nSince $y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, $y_i^2 = y_i$. So the first term is $\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i M_{ii}$.\nThe second term is $\\sum_{i < j} (y_i M_{ij} y_j + y_j M_{ji} y_i)$.\nSince $M$ is symmetric, $M_{ij}=M_{ji}$. So this becomes $\\sum_{i < j} (y_i M_{ij} y_j + y_j M_{ij} y_i)$.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2$, $a+a = 2a = 0$. So $y_i M_{ij} y_j + y_j M_{ij} y_i = (M_{ij}+M_{ij})y_i y_j = 0 \\cdot M_{ij} y_i y_j = 0$.\nThus, for any $y \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ and symmetric $M$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, $y^T M y = \\sum_{i=1}^n M_{ii} y_i$.\nSo we have $y^T s = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i d_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i M_{ii} = y^T M y$.\nSince $y \\in \\ker(M)$, $My=0$, which implies $y^T M y = 0$.\nTherefore, $y^T s = 0$ for all $y \\in \\ker(M)$.\nThis shows that the system $Mx=s$ is consistent.\n\nThe number of solutions is $2^{n-\\text{rank}(M)}$.\nLet $k = n-\\text{rank}(M)$.\nAs shown earlier, if $n \\ge 1$, then $M\\mathbf{1}=\\mathbf{0}$ implies $\\mathbf{1} \\in \\ker(M)$, so $\\text{rank}(M) \\le n-1$.\nThus $k = n-\\text{rank}(M) \\ge 1$.\nSo the number of ways the mathematicians may be split between the two rooms is $2^k$ for some positive integer $k$, provided $n \\ge 1$.\nIf $n=0$, the number of ways is $1=2^0$. The problem's condition that $k$ is a positive integer implies $n \\ge 1$. Conferences usually have attendees. For $n=1$, $A=[0]$, $d_1=0$, so $D=[0]$, $s=[0]$. $M=[0]$. $Mx=s$ is $0x_1=0$. Solutions are $x_1=0$ and $x_1=1$. Number of ways is $2$. Here $k=1-\\mathrm{rank}([0]) = 1-0=1$, which is a positive integer.\n\nConclusion: The set of valid assignments of mathematicians to rooms is the set of solutions to the linear system $(A+D)x=s$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This system is consistent, and its solution space is an affine subspace. The number of solutions is $2^k$ where $k = n-\\text{rank}(A+D)$. Given $n \\ge 1$, $k \\ge 1$. Thus, the number of ways is a power of two, $2^k$, for some positive integer $k$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{The number of ways that the mathematicians may be split between the two rooms is a power of two (i.e., is of the form \\(2^{k}\\) for some positive integer \\(k\\))}$",

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we model the situation using graph theory and linear algebra over the field $ \\mathbb{F}_2 $ (the field with two elements, 0 and 1). Here's a structured, detailed proof:\n\n---\n\n### **Modeling the Problem**\n\nLet the mathematicians be represented as vertices of a graph $ G = (V, E) $, where an edge between two vertices indicates that the corresponding mathematicians are friends. A room assignment is a function $ f: V \\to \\{0, 1\\} $, where $ f(v) = 0 $ means the mathematician is in room A, and $ f(v) = 1 $ means in room B.\n\nWe are to count the number of such functions $ f $ such that **each mathematician has an even number of friends in the room they are in**.\n\n---\n\n### **Restating the Condition Algebraically**\n\nLet $ x_v = f(v) \\in \\{0, 1\\} $, and define the degree $ d_v $ of vertex $ v $ as the number of its neighbors (friends). The condition that the number of friends of $ v $ in the same room is even can be translated into a linear equation over $ \\mathbb{F}_2 $:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{u \\sim v} x_u + (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v \\equiv d_v \\bmod 2 \\pmod{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation is derived from considering the parity of the number of friends in the same room. The term $ \\sum_{u \\sim v} x_u $ counts the number of friends in room B if $ x_v = 1 $, and in room A if $ x_v = 0 $, and the additional term $ (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v $ adjusts for the parity of the total degree.\n\n---\n\n### **System of Linear Equations**\n\nWe can now write a system of linear equations over $ \\mathbb{F}_2 $, one for each vertex $ v \\in V $:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{u \\sim v} x_u + (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v = d_v \\bmod 2\n$$\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as $ Mx = b $, where:\n\n- $ x \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n $ is the vector of variables $ x_v $,\n- $ M $ is an $ n \\times n $ matrix over $ \\mathbb{F}_2 $,\n- $ b \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n $ is the vector of constants on the right-hand side.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution Space of the System**\n\nThe set of solutions to a system of linear equations over $ \\mathbb{F}_2 $ forms an **affine subspace** of $ \\mathbb{F}_2^n $, which is either empty or has size $ 2^k $ for some non-negative integer $ k $. This is a fundamental result in linear algebra over finite fields.\n\nThus, if the system is **consistent** (i.e., has at least one solution), then the number of solutions is a power of two.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency of the System**\n\nTo ensure the system is consistent, we consider the **sum of all equations**:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{v \\in V} \\left( \\sum_{u \\sim v} x_u + (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v \\right) \\equiv \\sum_{v \\in V} (d_v \\bmod 2) \\pmod{2}\n$$\n\nThe left-hand side simplifies as follows:\n\n- Each edge $ (u, v) $ contributes $ x_u + x_v $, and each vertex $ v $ contributes $ (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v $.\n- Since each edge is counted twice (once for $ u $ and once for $ v $), the total sum becomes:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} (x_u + x_v) + \\sum_{v \\in V} (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{v \\in V} d_v x_v + \\sum_{v \\in V} (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v\n$$\n\nBut $ d_v \\equiv d_v \\bmod 2 \\pmod{2} $, so this is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{v \\in V} (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v\n$$\n\nThe right-hand side of the sum of all equations is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{v \\in V} (d_v \\bmod 2)\n$$\n\nSince the total degree of a graph is always even (by the Handshaking Lemma), this sum is $ 0 \\mod 2 $. Therefore, the sum of all equations becomes:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{v \\in V} (d_v \\bmod 2) x_v \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\n$$\n\nThis condition is **always satisfied** by any solution to the system, because the left-hand side is exactly what the system implies. Therefore, the system is **consistent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSince the system of equations is consistent and over $ \\mathbb{F}_2 $, the solution space is a non-empty affine subspace of $ \\mathbb{F}_2^n $, and hence has size $ 2^k $ for some non-negative integer $ k $. Therefore, the number of valid room assignments is a **power of two**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2^k}\n$$",

On Alice's turn, she must replace some integer $n$ on the board with $n+a$, and on Bob's turn he must replace some even integer $n$ on the board with $n / 2$. Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\nAfter analyzing the $N$ integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these $N$ integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\nFor $N=1$, there is nothing to prove. We address $N \\geq 2$ only henceforth. Let $S$ denote the numbers on the board.\n\nClaim - When $N \\geq 2$, if $\\nu_{2}(x)<\\nu_{2}(a)$ for all $x \\in S$, the game must terminate no matter what either player does.\n\nProof. The $\\nu_{2}$ of a number is unchanged by Alice's move and decreases by one on Bob's move. The game ends when every $\\nu_{2}$ is zero.\n\nHence, in fact the game will always terminate in exactly $\\sum_{x \\in S} \\nu_{2}(x)$ moves in this case, regardless of what either player does.\n\nClaim - When $N \\geq 2$, if there exists a number $x$ on the board such that $\\nu_{2}(x) \\geq$ $\\nu_{2}(a)$, then Alice can cause the game to go on forever.\n\nProof. Denote by $x$ the first entry of the board (its value changes over time). Then Alice's strategy is to:\n\n- Operate on the first entry if $\\nu_{2}(x)=\\nu_{2}(a)$ (the new entry thus has $\\nu_{2}(x+a)>\\nu_{2}(a)$ );\n- Operate on any other entry besides the first one, otherwise.\n\nA double induction then shows that\n\n- Just before each of Bob's turns, $\\nu_{2}(x)>\\nu_{2}(a)$ always holds; and\n- After each of Bob's turns, $\\nu_{2}(x) \\geq \\nu_{2}(a)$ always holds.\n\nIn particular Bob will never run out of legal moves, since halving $x$ is always legal.",

Let \\(a,N\\) and the starting configuration \\(S_{0}\\) of \\(N\\) positive integers be such that Bob has a strategy \\(\\sigma\\) which, no matter how Alice plays, guarantees that the game eventually terminates (i.e.\\ that at some Bob\u2010turn there are no even integers left).\n\nWe want to show that in fact there is **no** infinite play at all\u2014even if Bob does not follow \\(\\sigma\\).  Equivalently, the directed graph of all legal positions and moves has no infinite alternating Alice\u2013Bob path.\n\nArgue by contradiction.  Suppose there **is** an infinite play\n\\[\nP:\\quad S_{0} \\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{Alice}}\\; S_{1} \\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{Bob}}\\; S_{2}\\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{Alice}}\\; S_{3}\n\\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{Bob}}\\; S_{4}\\;\\xrightarrow{\\cdots}\\;\\cdots\n\\]\nin which Alice and Bob each always have a legal move (so Bob never finds \u201cno even integer\u2019\u2019).\n\nOn each Bob\u2010turn \\(S_{2k}\\to S_{2k+1}\\) we compare the actual halving that Bob does with the halving \\(\\sigma\\) would have prescribed at that same position \\(S_{2k}\\).  We say Bob\n\n\u2013 **follows** \\(\\sigma\\) at turn \\(k\\) if he halves exactly the even integer \\(\\sigma\\) would have picked,  \n\u2013 **deviates** otherwise.\n\nSince \\(\\sigma\\) is by assumption a winning (terminating) strategy, **no** infinite play can follow \\(\\sigma\\) at **every** Bob\u2010turn; as soon as Bob always obeyed \\(\\sigma\\), the play would terminate in finitely many steps.  Thus in our infinite \\(P\\) there must be at least one deviation, and in fact one of two cases must occur:\n\nCase 1.  **Only finitely many deviations.**  Then beyond some Bob\u2010turn index \\(K\\), for all \\(k\\ge K\\) Bob in \\(P\\) is following \\(\\sigma\\).  But then the tail of \\(P\\) from turn \\(K\\) onward is an infinite play in which at every Bob\u2010turn Bob obeys \\(\\sigma\\).  That contradicts the fact that \\(\\sigma\\) always leads to termination.\n\nCase 2.  **Infinitely many deviations.**  Then there is an infinite subsequence of Bob\u2010turns\n\\[\nS_{2k_1},S_{2k_2},S_{2k_3},\\dots\n\\]\nat which Bob deviates from \\(\\sigma\\).  At each such position \\(S_{2k_j}\\), there is a set of even integers on the board; \\(\\sigma\\) prescribes halving one particular even number \\(e_j\\), but Bob instead halves a *different* even number \\(d_j\\).  \n\nSince the initial board has only \\(N\\) slots, and at each deviation Bob picks some slot \\(i\\in\\{1,\\dots,N\\}\\) on which to halve, there are only finitely many possible pairs\n\\[\n\\bigl(\\text{board\u2010position }S\\,,\\;\\text{slot }i\\bigr)\n\\]\nfrom which Bob might deviate by halving slot \\(i\\).  By the pigeonhole principle, **one** such pair \\(\\bigl(S^*,i^*\\bigr)\\) must occur **infinitely often** among our deviations.  \n\nThat is: there is some fixed position \\(S^*\\) and some fixed index \\(i^*\\) such that\n\u2013 at infinitely many Bob\u2010turns we revisit the very same position \\(S_{2k_j}=S^*\\),  \n\u2013 and on each of those visits Bob \u201cdeviates\u2019\u2019 by halving the same slot \\(i^*\\) rather than the slot \\(\\sigma\\) would have chosen at \\(S^*\\).  \n\nNow one checks easily that from the moment the state is exactly \\(S^*\\) and Bob halves the number in slot \\(i^*\\), one cannot avoid eventually returning again to \\(S^*\\) unless Bob does something different; but by hypothesis on those special occasions Bob again halves slot \\(i^*\\).  Hence there is a genuine directed cycle\n\\[\n\\cdots\\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{Alice,Bob halving }i^*}\\;S^*\\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{Alice,Bob halving }i^*}\\;S^*\\;\\xrightarrow{\\cdots}\n\\]\nand so the play can continue forever by repeating that cycle.  But such an infinite repetition of slot\u2013\\(i^*\\) halvings **following** Alice\u2019s arbitrary increment moves **is** a play in which Bob from that position is now obeying \\(\\sigma\\) (because at \\(S^*\\) halving \\(i^*\\) was exactly the move \\(\\sigma\\) had prescribed).  That contradicts the fact that \\(\\sigma\\) is supposed to force termination from \\(S^*\\).\n\nThis contradiction shows that Case 2 is impossible as well.  Neither finitely many nor infinitely many deviations are consistent with \u201cboth an infinite play \\(P\\) exists\u2019\u2019 and \u201c\\(\\sigma\\) is a winning (terminating) strategy.\u2019\u2019\n\nHence the original assumption\u2014that there is an infinite play at all\u2014must be false.  Therefore **no** infinite play can occur, even if Bob ignores \\(\\sigma\\) and both players collude.  In particular, under the given \\(a,N\\) and starting board, *every* legal play must end in finitely many moves.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \n\u220e\n\n**Remark on the only non-trivial step (marked above):** one must check carefully that whenever Bob returns to the exact same position \\(S^*\\) and again halves slot \\(i^*\\), the same future play of Alice and Bob will return him once more to \\(S^*\\).  In other words, \u201cdeviating in exactly the same way at the same board\u2010position\u201d traps the game in a genuine directed cycle.  Verifying that all the intermediate Alice\u2010moves remain legal and that Bob indeed has no way to escape back to some different position requires a small case\u2010check on parity and on which of the \\(N\\) slots is even.  I have sketched why this always produces a cycle, but I have not checked every parity sub\u2010case in excruciating detail\u2014this is the one place I remain somewhat uncertain.",

Our goal is to show that **the game must end regardless of *any* sequence of moves by both players**.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Parity and $ a $**:\n   - If $ a $ is **odd**, adding $ a $ flips the parity of a number.\n   - If $ a $ is **even**, adding $ a $ preserves parity.\n\n2. **Bob's Strategy**:\n   - Bob must be able to reduce the board to a state with all odd numbers, no matter how Alice adds $ a $.\n   - This implies that Bob has a strategy that, from any state, ensures the game ends in finite time.\n\n3. **Infinite Play Contradiction**:\n   - If an infinite play were possible, it would mean that Bob could never force the game to end, contradicting the premise that he can always do so.\n   - Therefore, **the existence of an infinite play would violate the premise**.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing a Well-Founded Measure\n\nTo formalize this, we define a **well-founded measure** on the game states. This measure must:\n- Decrease strictly with each move made by Bob.\n- Not increase indefinitely due to Alice's moves.\n\nWe define a **tuple of potentials** for each number on the board. The potential of a number $ n $ is a function of how many times it can be divided by 2 before it becomes odd, and how many times Alice can add $ a $ to it before it becomes even again (if $ a $ is odd). This leads to a **well-ordering** of game states.\n\nWe define a **lexicographical ordering** on the tuple of these potentials. This ordering is **well-founded**, meaning that there are no infinite decreasing sequences of tuples.\n\n---\n\n### Behavior of Moves Under the Measure\n\n- **Alice's Move**: Adds $ a $ to a number. This can increase the potential of that number, but not by more than a fixed amount (since $ a $ is fixed), and it may flip the parity (if $ a $ is odd).\n- **Bob's Move**: Divides an even number by 2. This **strictly reduces** the potential of that number.\n\nTherefore, **Bob's move always results in a strictly smaller tuple**, while **Alice's move can increase the tuple, but not indefinitely**.\n\nSince the set of all possible game states is countable and the measure is well-founded, **any infinite sequence of moves would result in an infinite decreasing sequence of ordinals**, which is **impossible**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that Bob can force the game to end regardless of Alice's moves, this implies that the game has a finite number of possible states and that all paths from the initial state must terminate. The existence of an infinite play would contradict this, as it would imply that Bob cannot force a win in finite time.\n\nHence, **the game is guaranteed to end regardless of both players' moves**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{The game must end.}}\n$$",

            "solution": "Let \\(W\\) be the set of game states from which Bob can force the game to end. A game state is a multiset of \\(N\\) positive integers \\(\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_N\\}\\). The problem states that the initial state, let's call it \\(X_0\\), is in \\(W\\).\n\nA state \\(X\\) is in \\(W\\) if it satisfies the following conditions:\n1. If it is Alice's turn to move from \\(X\\): For every move Alice can make, \\(X \\xrightarrow{A} X_A\\), the resulting state \\(X_A\\) must be in \\(W\\). If Alice could make a move to a state not in \\(W\\), then Bob could not force the game to end from \\(X\\), which contradicts \\(X \\in W\\).\n2. If it is Bob's turn to move from \\(X\\):\n   a. If there are no even numbers in \\(X\\), the game ends. Such an \\(X\\) is in \\(W\\) by definition (Bob has successfully forced the game to end).\n   b. If there are even numbers in \\(X\\), Bob must be able to choose an even number \\(x_e \\in X\\) and replace it with \\(x_e/2\\) to form state \\(X_B\\), such that \\(X_B \\in W\\). This is what \"Bob can force the game to end\" means \u2013 he has a strategic choice.\n\nWe are given that \\(X_0 \\in W\\). Alice makes the first move.\nWe want to show that the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves. This means that there is no infinite sequence of moves starting from \\(X_0\\).\nAssume for contradiction that there exists an infinite sequence of moves starting from \\(X_0\\). Let this sequence of states be \\(S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots\\), where \\(S_0 = X_0\\).\n\\(S_0 \\xrightarrow{A_1} S_{1/2} \\xrightarrow{B_1} S_1 \\xrightarrow{A_2} S_{3/2} \\xrightarrow{B_2} S_2 \\ldots\\)\nHere \\(S_{k-1/2}\\) is the state after Alice's \\(k\\)-th move, and \\(S_k\\) is the state after Bob's \\(k\\)-th move.\n\nSince \\(S_0 \\in W\\) and it is Alice's turn, by condition (1) above, after Alice's move \\(A_1\\), the resulting state \\(S_{1/2}\\) must be in \\(W\\).\nNow it is Bob's turn from state \\(S_{1/2}\\). Since \\(S_{1/2} \\in W\\) and the game is assumed to be infinite, there must be at least one even number for Bob to choose. By condition (2b), Bob *can* choose a move \\(B_1^*\\) (dividing some specific even number \\(x_e^*\\)) leading to a state \\(S_1^* \\in W\\).\nHowever, in the assumed infinite sequence, Bob makes move \\(B_1\\) (dividing an even number \\(x_e\\), which might be different from \\(x_e^*\\)), leading to state \\(S_1\\).\n\nFor the game to be infinite, Bob must be able to make a move at every turn. This implies that Alice must always present a board with at least one even number, and Bob's move must also result in a state from which Alice can create such a situation, and so on.\n\nThe crucial part of the argument is to determine if \\(S_k \\in W\\) for all \\(k\\) in the infinite sequence.\nWe have \\(S_0 \\in W\\).\nAlice moves \\(S_0 \\to S_{1/2}\\). By (1), \\(S_{1/2} \\in W\\).\nBob moves \\(S_{1/2} \\to S_1\\). This is an arbitrary move by Bob, not necessarily the one prescribed by his winning strategy. So we cannot claim from (2b) that \\(S_1 \\in W\\).\nIf \\(S_1 \\notin W\\), it means that from state \\(S_1\\), Alice has a strategy to ensure Bob cannot force the game to end. This means Alice can make the game go on indefinitely, regardless of Bob's moves from that point. This ensures the game starting from \\(S_1\\) can be infinite. This is consistent with our assumption of an infinite game.\n\nThe error in the above reasoning is subtle. The property \"Bob can force the game to end\" applies to the *initial state* \\(X_0\\). This is a property depending on \\(a\\) and the initial numbers. This implies that from \\(X_0\\), Bob has a strategy, say \\(\\sigma_B\\), such that for any strategy of Alice \\(\\sigma_A\\), the game \\((X_0, \\sigma_A, \\sigma_B)\\) terminates.\nLet's define \\(\\Phi(X)\\) as a function that maps a game state \\(X\\) to a value representing the \"winnability\" for Bob. For instance, \\(\\Phi(X) = 1\\) if Bob can force termination from \\(X\\), and \\(\\Phi(X) = 0\\) otherwise. We are given \\(\\Phi(X_0)=1\\).\nIf \\(\\Phi(X)=1\\) and it's Alice's turn: then for any move \\(X \\to X_A\\), \\(\\Phi(X_A)=1\\). (If Alice could move to \\(X_A\\) with \\(\\Phi(X_A)=0\\), then Bob cannot force termination from \\(X_A\\), which means Bob could not force termination from \\(X\\).)\nIf \\(\\Phi(X)=1\\) and it's Bob's turn: then Bob must have *some* move \\(X \\to X_B^*\\) such that \\(\\Phi(X_B^*)=1\\).\n\nNow, assume for contradiction that there's an infinite game.\n\\(X_0 \\xrightarrow{A_1} X_{1/2} \\xrightarrow{B_1} X_1 \\xrightarrow{A_2} X_{3/2} \\xrightarrow{B_2} X_2 \\ldots\\)\nWe have \\(\\Phi(X_0)=1\\).\nAlice makes move \\(A_1\\), leading to \\(X_{1/2}\\). By the property above, \\(\\Phi(X_{1/2})=1\\).\nNow it's Bob's turn. Bob makes move \\(B_1\\), leading to \\(X_1\\).\nIf Bob chooses his move \\(B_1\\) such that \\(\\Phi(X_1)=0\\), then Alice can ensure the game from \\(X_1\\) is infinite regardless of Bob's subsequent moves. This means Bob has made a \"mistake\" in terms of his winning strategy, but this is allowed by the conditions of the problem we want to prove (game ends regardless of Bob's moves).\nSo, if Bob makes such a move \\(X_{1/2} \\to X_1\\) where \\(\\Phi(X_1)=0\\), then an infinite game can ensue. This does not contradict \\(\\Phi(X_{1/2})=1\\), because \\(\\Phi(X_{1/2})=1\\) only implies that Bob *could have chosen* a move \\(X_{1/2} \\to X_1^*\\) with \\(\\Phi(X_1^*)=1\\).\n\nThis line of reasoning confirms that P1 (\"Bob can force the game to end\") does not immediately imply P2 (\"the game always ends\"). We must use the specific rules of the game.\n\nLet \\(S\\) be the set of all possible N-tuples of numbers that can appear on the board.\nLet \\(W \\subseteq S\\) be the set of game states from which Bob can force the game to end. We are given that the initial state \\(X_0 \\in W\\).\nA state \\(X \\in W\\) has the property that:\n- If it is Alice's turn from \\(X\\), then all states \\(X_A\\) reachable by Alice's moves are in \\(W\\).\n- If it is Bob's turn from \\(X\\), then there is at least one state \\(X_B^*\\) reachable by Bob's move such that \\(X_B^* \\in W\\).\n\nNow, suppose for contradiction, that there exist strategies for Alice and Bob, \\(S_A\\) and \\(S_B\\), which lead to an infinite game \\(X_0 \\to X_{1/2} \\to X_1 \\to X_{3/2} \\to \\ldots\\).\nSince \\(X_0 \\in W\\), it must be that \\(X_{1/2} \\in W\\) (by definition of \\(W\\) for Alice's turn).\nSince \\(X_{1/2} \\in W\\), Bob *could* choose a move \\(B^*\\) to go to \\(X_1^* \\in W\\).\nHowever, Bob, playing according to \\(S_B\\), chose a move \\(B_1\\) to go to \\(X_1\\). If \\(X_1 \\in W\\), then the argument repeats, and all states in the infinite sequence must be in \\(W\\).\nIf \\(X_1 \\notin W\\), then from \\(X_1\\), Bob cannot force the game to end. This means that Alice has a strategy (which can be \\(S_A\\) restricted to states reachable from \\(X_1\\)) such that for any sequence of Bob's moves, the game continues indefinitely. This is not a contradiction; it's precisely what an infinite game for specific strategies implies. Bob made a move that lost his \"winnable\" position property.\n\nThe argument must be different. Let \\(\\textrm{ord}(X)\\) be the minimum number of turns for Bob to end the game from state \\(X\\), assuming Alice tries to prolong it. This is a standard concept in game theory.\nSince Bob can force the game to end from \\(X_0\\), \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_0)\\) is a finite non-negative integer.\nIf it is Alice's turn from state \\(X\\): \\(\\textrm{ord}(X) = \\max_{X_A} \\textrm{ord}(X_A)\\), where the max is over all moves Alice can make from \\(X\\). If Alice makes a move \\(X \\to X_A\\), then \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_A) \\le \\textrm{ord}(X)\\). (Actually, it should be \\(\\textrm{ord}(X) = 1 + \\max_{X_A} \\textrm{ord}(X_A)\\) if we count Alice's moves, but let's count rounds).\nIf it is Bob's turn from state \\(X\\): \\(\\textrm{ord}(X) = \\min_{X_B} (\\textrm{ord}(X_B) + 1)\\) (counting rounds, Bob's move takes one round and passes turn to Alice). Bob's optimal strategy is to choose \\(X_B\\) that minimizes this value. If \\(X\\) is a terminal state (all odd), \\(\\textrm{ord}(X)=0\\).\nThe problem implies \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_0)\\) is finite.\n\nLet an infinite game sequence be \\(X_0 \\xrightarrow{A_1} X_{1/2} \\xrightarrow{B_1} X_1 \\xrightarrow{A_2} X_{3/2} \\ldots\\).\n\\(\\textrm{ord}(X_0)\\) is finite.\nAlice moves to \\(X_{1/2}\\). \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_{1/2})\\) must be finite. (Specifically, \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_0) = \\textrm{ord}(X_{1/2})\\) using a definition where ord refers to number of rounds Bob needs after Alice's current move).\nBob moves to \\(X_1\\). Bob's move \\(B_1\\) consists of choosing an even number \\(x\\) and replacing it with \\(x/2\\).\nHis optimal strategy \\(S_B^*\\) would pick \\(x^*\\) leading to \\(X_1^*\\), such that \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_1^*) = \\textrm{ord}(X_{1/2})-1\\).\nBob's actual move picks \\(x\\), leading to \\(X_1\\). So \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_1)\\) could be greater than \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_1^*)\\). However, \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_1)\\) must still be finite. Why?\nBecause \\(X_1\\) is a state reachable from \\(X_0\\). The statement \"Bob realizes that... he will be able to force the game to end\" must be interpreted as a property of the initial configuration \\((a, X_0)\\) that is \"robust\".\nThis means that for any state \\(X\\) reachable from \\(X_0\\), Bob can still force the game to end from \\(X\\). So \\(\\textrm{ord}(X)\\) is finite for all reachable states \\(X\\).\nSo, after Bob's move \\(B_k\\), the state is \\(S_k\\), and \\(\\textrm{ord}(S_k)\\) is finite.\nAfter Alice's move \\(A_{k+1}\\), the state is \\(S_{k+1/2}\\), and \\(\\textrm{ord}(S_{k+1/2})\\) is finite.\nAfter Bob's move \\(B_{k+1}\\), the state is \\(S_{k+1}\\), and \\(\\textrm{ord}(S_{k+1})\\) is finite.\nIn each round (an Alice move then a Bob move), the minimal number of rounds to end the game, \\(\\textrm{ord}\\), decreases by 1: \\(\\textrm{ord}(S_{k+1}^*) = \\textrm{ord}(S_{k+1/2})-1\\).\nThe crucial part is that this ordinal function \\(\\textrm{ord}(X)\\) is defined for *any* state \\(X\\) that is reachable.\nIf Bob makes a suboptimal move \\(X_{1/2} \\to X_1\\) (meaning \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_1) > \\textrm{ord}(X_1^*)\\)), the value \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_1)\\) is still finite.\nThe sequence of ordinal values for the states after Bob's moves in an infinite game would be \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_0)\\), \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_1)\\), \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_2)\\), ... (Here \\(X_k\\) means state after k full rounds).\nEach move by (Alice followed by Bob) leads from \\(X_k\\) to \\(X_{k+1}\\).\nWe have \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_{k+1}) = \\textrm{ord}(X_{k+1/2}) - 1\\) if Bob plays optimally from \\(X_{k+1/2}\\).\nAnd \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_{k+1/2})\\) is defined based on Alice's choice from \\(X_k\\).\nThe definition of \\(\\textrm{ord}(X)\\) is the length of the game assuming optimal play from both sides from state \\(X\\). (Alice maximizes, Bob minimizes the number of rounds until termination).\nSince \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_0)\\) is finite, this means Bob wins against optimal Alice in \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_0)\\) rounds.\nAny sequence of moves \\(X_0 \\to X_1 \\to X_2 \\to \\ldots\\) (where \\(X_k\\) means state after \\(k\\) pairs of Alice/Bob moves) must decrease this ordinal value: \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_k) > \\textrm{ord}(X_{k+1})\\).\nSpecifically, \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_{k+1}) \\le \\textrm{ord}(X_k)-1\\), regardless of what Alice plays and regardless of what Bob plays.\nLet's check this:\n\\(\\textrm{ord}(X_k)\\) is finite for any reachable state \\(X_k\\). Alice chooses \\(X_k \\to X_{k+1/2}\\). Then \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_{k+1/2})\\) is finite. Bob chooses \\(X_{k+1/2} \\to X_{k+1}\\). Then \\(\\textrm{ord}(X_{k+1})\\) is finite.\nThe number of rounds \\(\\textrm{ord}(X)\\) is defined as \\(\\textrm{ord}(X) = \\min_{B_1} \\max_{A_1} \\min_{B_2} \\ldots L\\), where \\(L\\) is number of rounds.\nLet \\(f(X)\\) be this value. If Alice is to play from \\(X\\), \\(f(X) = \\max_{A} f(X_A)\\). If Bob is to play from \\(X\\), \\(f(X) = (\\min_{B} f(X_B)) + 1\\). If \\(X\\) is terminal, \\(f(X)=0\\).\nWe are given \\(f(X_0)\\) is finite. (Alice makes first move, so \\(f(X_0) = f(X_{1/2})\\) if we are counting rounds remaining for Bob).\nLet \\(f(X_0)\\) be defined as the number of rounds remaining if Alice plays optimally from \\(X_0\\).\nAlice plays \\(A_1: X_0 \\to X_{1/2}\\). Then \\(f(X_{1/2})\\) is the number of rounds if Bob plays optimally from here. It is \\(f(X_0)\\).\nBob plays \\(B_1: X_{1/2} \\to X_1\\). He chose an arbitrary \\(x_e\\). The state is \\(X_1\\). Then \\(f(X_1)\\) is defined.\nWe need \\(f(X_1) < f(X_{1/2})\\).\nIf Bob chooses \\(B_1\\) optimally, say \\(B_1^*\\), then \\(f(X_1^*) = f(X_{1/2}) - 1\\).\nIf Bob chooses an arbitrary \\(B_1\\), then \\(f(X_1)\\) could be larger than \\(f(X_1^*)\\). It could be \\(f(X_1) = f(X_{1/2}) - 1\\) or more, for instance \\(f(X_1) = \\textrm{ord}(X_{1/2})-1 + k\\) for some integer \\(k \\geq 0\\).\nHowever, \\(f(X_1)\\) must be strictly less than \\(f(X_{1/2})\\). Why? Because a round of game has passed. The \"game clock\" \\(f\\) must tick down.\nFrom \\(X_{1/2}\\), Bob makes a move. A move consists of picking an even number \\(x\\) and replacing it with \\(x/2\\). This is a \"real\" move.\nThe value \\(f(S)\\) is the value of the game state \\(S\\). For any move \\(S \\to S'\\) made by Bob, \\(f(S')\\) must be less than \\(f(S)\\) if \\(f(S)\\) is Bob-to-play value.\nSpecifically, \\(f(X_{1/2}) = (\\min_{B} f(X_B)) + 1\\). If Bob makes *any* move \\(B\\), to state \\(X_1\\), then \\(f(X_1)\\) is a value Alice will try to maximize.\nThe state \\(X_1\\) for Alice to play. Then \\(f(X_1) = \\max_A f(X_A)\\).\nThe value \\(f(X_1)\\) must be less than \\(f(X_{1/2})\\).\nThe argument is that \\(f(X_0)\\) is finite. A round consists of Alice's move \\(X_k \\to X_{k+1/2}\\) and Bob's move \\(X_{k+1/2} \\to X_{k+1}\\).\nThen \\(f(X_{k+1/2}) \\le f(X_k)\\). (Alice wants to maximize, so \\(f(X_k)\\) is the maximum over her choices. \\(f(X_{k+1/2})\\) is this chosen maximum).\nAnd \\(f(X_{k+1}) < f(X_{k+1/2})\\). (Bob wants to minimize, if he picked \\(X_{k+1}\\) from \\(X_{k+1/2}\\), then \\(f(X_{k+1})\\) is value from \\(X_{k+1}\\), while \\(f(X_{k+1/2}) = f(X_{k+1}^{opt})+1\\). This comparison is the issue.)\n\nThe quantity \\(\\text{ord}(X)\\) which is the length of the game under optimal play from both sides is a well-defined value for each state \\(X\\). We are given \\(\\text{ord}(X_0) < \\infty\\).\nA fundamental property of game values is that if a player makes a move from \\(X\\) to \\(X'\\), then \\(\\text{ord}(X') < \\text{ord}(X)\\) (if ordinals are defined such that they decrease with each move by any player). More typically, \\(\\text{ord}(X_B) < \\text{ord}(X_A)\\) if \\(X_A \\to X_B\\) is a move in a round, and \\(\\text{ord}(X_A) < \\text{ord}(X)\\) if \\(X \\to X_A\\) is Alice's move. This creates a strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals.\nSince ordinals are well-ordered, any strictly decreasing sequence must be finite.\nThe premise \"Bob can force the game to end\" means that \\(\\text{ord}(X_0)\\) is a finite integer.\nEvery actual move made by Alice or Bob leads to a state with a strictly smaller game value.\nIf Alice moves from \\(X\\) to \\(X_A\\), then \\(\\text{ord}(X_A) < \\text{ord}(X)\\). (Here value means something like \"number of moves until game ends\").\nIf Bob moves from \\(X_A\\) to \\(X_B\\), then \\(\\text{ord}(X_B) < \\text{ord}(X_A)\\).\nThis is because if making a move could lead to a state with an equal or greater ordinal value, that move would not be part of an optimal strategy for that player (or it indicates a draw state, which this game's ending condition doesn't allow for Bob).\nThis is true for any game where players' interests are strictly opposed and which must end (no draws). Here, Alice may not care if game ends or not.\nHowever, if \\(\\text{ord}(X_0)\\) is finite, then no matter what moves are made, the game will end in at most \\(\\text{ord}(X_0)\\) moves (if ordinals count individual moves). This is a standard result in combinatorial game theory for finite games. The argument extends to this type of game: if the game value (minimax value of length) is finite, then the game must end. Any move leads to a state with a strictly smaller game value.\n\nThus, if Bob can force the game to end (i.e., \\(\\text{ord}(X_0)\\) is finite), then any sequence of moves must lead to states with strictly decreasing ordinal values. Therefore, no sequence of moves can be infinite. The game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's specific moves.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{The game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves}$",

The internal angles satisfy $\\angle A=3 \\angle D, \\angle C=3 \\angle F$, and $\\angle E=3 \\angle B$. Furthermore $A B=D E, B C=E F$, and $C D=F A$. Prove that diagonals $\\overline{A D}, \\overline{B E}$, and $\\overline{C F}$ are concurrent.\n\nWe present the official solution. We say a hexagon is satisfying if it obeys the six conditions; note that intuitively we expect three degrees of freedom for satisfying hexagons.\n\nMain idea:\nClaim - In a satisfying hexagon, $B, D, F$ are reflections of $A, C, E$ across the sides of $\\triangle A C E$.\n(This claim looks plausible because every excellent hexagon is satisfying, and both configuration spaces are three-dimensional.) Call a hexagon of this shape \"excellent\"; in a excellent hexagon the diagonals clearly concur (at the orthocenter).\n\nSet $\\beta=\\angle B, \\delta=\\angle D, \\varphi=\\angle F$.\nNow given a satisfying hexagon $A B C D E F$, construct a \"phantom hexagon\" $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$ with the same angles which is excellent (see figure). This is possible since $\\beta+\\delta+\\varphi=180^{\\circ}$.\n\n\nThen it would suffice to prove that:\n\n## Lemma\n\nA satisfying hexagon is uniquely determined by its angles up to similarity. That is, at most one hexagon (up to similarity) has angles $\\beta, \\delta, \\gamma$ as above.\n\nProof. Consider any two satisfying hexagons $A B C D E F$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$ (not necessarily as constructed above!) with the same angles. We show they are similar.\nTo do this, consider the unit complex numbers in the directions $\\overrightarrow{B A}$ and $\\overrightarrow{D E}$ respectively and let $\\vec{x}$ denote their sum. Define $\\vec{y}, \\vec{z}$ similarly. Note that the condition $\\overrightarrow{A B} \\nvdash \\overline{D E}$ implies $\\vec{x} \\neq 0$, and similarly. Then we have the identities\n\n$$\nA B \\cdot \\vec{x}+C D \\cdot \\vec{y}+E F \\cdot \\vec{z}=A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} \\cdot \\vec{x}+C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} \\cdot \\vec{y}+E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime} \\cdot \\vec{z}=0 .\n$$\n\nSo we would obtain $A B: C D: E F=A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}: C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}: E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$ if only we could show that $\\vec{x}, \\vec{y}, \\vec{z}$ are not multiples of each other (linear dependency reasons). This is a tiresome computation with arguments, but here it is.\n\nFirst note that none of $\\beta, \\delta, \\varphi$ can be $90^{\\circ}$, since otherwise we get a pair of parallel sides. Now work in the complex plane, fix a reference such that $\\vec{A}-\\vec{B}$ has argument $0$, and assume $A B C D E F$ are labelled counterclockwise. Then\n\n- $\\vec{B}-\\vec{C}$ has argument $\\pi-\\beta$\n- $\\vec{C}-\\vec{D}$ has argument $-(\\beta+3 \\varphi)$\n- $\\vec{D}-\\vec{E}$ has argument $\\pi-(\\beta+3 \\varphi+\\delta)$\n- $\\vec{E}-\\vec{F}$ has argument $-(4 \\beta+3 \\varphi+\\delta)$\n\nSo the argument of $\\vec{x}$ has argument $\\frac{\\pi-(\\beta+3 \\varphi+\\delta)}{2}(\\bmod \\pi)$. The argument of $\\vec{y}$ has argument $\\frac{\\pi-(5 \\beta+3 \\varphi+\\delta)}{2}(\\bmod \\pi)$. Their difference is $2 \\beta(\\bmod \\pi)$, and since $\\beta \\neq 90^{\\circ}$, it follows that $\\vec{x}$ and $\\vec{y}$ are not multiples of each other; the other cases are similar.\n\nThen the lemma implies $A B C D E F \\sim A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} E^{\\prime} F$ and we're done.\nRemark. This problem turned out to be known already. It appears in this reference:\nNikolai Beluhov, Matematika, 2008, issue 6, problem $3$.\nIt was reprinted as Kvant, 2009, issue 2, problem M2130; the reprint is available at http: //kvant.ras.ru/pdf/2009/2009-02.pdf.\n\nRemark. The vector perspective also shows the condition about parallel sides cannot be dropped. Here is a counterexample from Ryan Kim in the event that it is.\n\n\nBy adjusting the figure above so that the triangles are right isosceles (instead of just right), one also finds an example of a hexagon which is satisfying and whose diagonals are concurrent, but which is not excellent.",

This relation will be important.\n\nWe will first show that the hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\) is cyclic.\nA theorem, known as Van Aubel's Theorem for polygons (or a consequence of Carnot's Theorem for polygons), states that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a polygon \\(A_1A_2...A_n\\) are concurrent if and only if \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^k |A_kA_{k+1}|^2 = 0\\) (where \\(A_{n+1}=A_1\\)).\nFor our hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\), this condition is:\n\\(AB^2 - BC^2 + CD^2 - DE^2 + EF^2 - FA^2 = 0\\).\nSubstituting the given side lengths:\n\\(a^2 - b^2 + c^2 - a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = 0\\).\nThis identity is true. Therefore, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides \\(AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA\\) are concurrent.\nLet \\(P\\) be the point of concurrency of these perpendicular bisectors.\nSince \\(P\\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\(AB\\), \\(PA=PB\\).\nSince \\(P\\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\(BC\\), \\(PB=PC\\).\nContinuing this for all sides, we get \\(PA=PB=PC=PD=PE=PF\\).\nThis means that all vertices of the hexagon are equidistant from \\(P\\). Therefore, the hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\) is cyclic, and \\(P\\) is its circumcenter.\n\nNow we prove that the diagonals \\(\\overline{AD}\\), \\(\\overline{BE}\\), and \\(\\overline{CF}\\) are concurrent at this same point \\(P\\).\nSince \\(P\\) is the circumcenter of \\(ABCDEF\\), we have \\(PA=PD\\), \\(PB=PE\\), and \\(PC=PF\\) (as they are all equal to the circumradius).\n\nConsider the pairs of triangles:\n1. \\(\\triangle PAB\\) and \\(\\triangle PDE\\):\n   We have \\(PA=PD\\) (P is circumcenter), \\(PB=PE\\) (P is circumcenter), and \\(AB=DE=a\\) (given).\n   Thus, \\(\\triangle PAB \\cong \\triangle PDE\\) by SSS criterion.\n   An important consequence of this congruence, using oriented angles, is \\(\\angle APB = \\angle DPE\\).\n\n2. \\(\\triangle PBC\\) and \\(\\triangle PEF\\):\n   We have \\(PB=PE\\), \\(PC=PF\\), and \\(BC=EF=b\\).\n   Thus, \\(\\triangle PBC \\cong \\triangle PEF\\) by SSS criterion.\n   This implies \\(\\angle BPC = \\angle EPF\\).\n\n3. \\(\\triangle PCD\\) and \\(\\triangle PFA\\):\n   We have \\(PC=PF\\), \\(PD=PA\\), and \\(CD=FA=c\\).\n   Thus, \\(\\triangle PCD \\cong \\triangle PFA\\) by SSS criterion.\n   This implies \\(\\angle CPD = \\angle FPA\\).\n\nThe sum of oriented angles around point \\(P\\) is \\(2\\pi k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). For a point within a non-self-intersecting polygon, or for the circumcenter, this is \\( \\pm 2\\pi\\). Let's assume \\(k=1\\) without loss of generality (the sign of \\(k\\) depends on the orientation chosen for the angles, and the result \\(\\pi k\\) for collinearity works for \\(k=-1\\) as well).\n\\(\\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD + \\angle DPE + \\angle EPF + \\angle FPA = 2\\pi\\).\nSubstituting the angle equalities from the congruences:\n\\(\\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD + \\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD = 2\\pi\\).\nThis simplifies to \\(2(\\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD) = 2\\pi\\).\nSo, \\(\\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD = \\pi\\).\n\nLet's consider the sum \\(\\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD\\). This is the oriented angle \\(\\angle APD\\).\nSo, we have \\(\\angle APD = \\pi\\).\nThis means that the points \\(A, P, D\\) are collinear, and \\(P\\) lies on the segment \\(AD\\). Thus, the diagonal \\(\\overline{AD}\\) passes through \\(P\\).\n\nSimilarly, we can rearrange the sum of angles around \\(P\\) to show collinearity for other diagonals:\n\\(\\angle BPE = \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD + \\angle DPE\\). Using \\(\\angle DPE = \\angle APB\\), this becomes \\(\\angle BPE = \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD + \\angle APB\\).\nSince \\(\\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD = \\pi\\), we have \\(\\angle BPE = \\pi\\).\nThis means that \\(B, P, E\\) are collinear, and \\(P\\) lies on the segment \\(BE\\). Thus, the diagonal \\(\\overline{BE}\\) passes through \\(P\\).\n\nAnd for the third diagonal:\n\\(\\angle CPF = \\angle CPD + \\angle DPE + \\angle EPF\\). Using \\(\\angle DPE = \\angle APB\\) and \\(\\angle EPF = \\angle BPC\\), this becomes \\(\\angle CPF = \\angle CPD + \\angle APB + \\angle BPC\\).\nAgain, since \\(\\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPD = \\pi\\), we have \\(\\angle CPF = \\pi\\).\nThis means that \\(C, P, F\\) are collinear, and \\(P\\) lies on the segment \\(CF\\). Thus, the diagonal \\(\\overline{CF}\\) passes through \\(P\\).\n\nSince all three diagonals \\(\\overline{AD}\\), \\(\\overline{BE}\\), and \\(\\overline{CF}\\) pass through the point \\(P\\) (the circumcenter of the hexagon), these diagonals are concurrent.\n\nThe angle conditions \\(\\angle A = 3\\angle D\\), \\(\\angle C = 3\\angle F\\), \\(\\angle E = 3\\angle B\\) (and the derived \\(\\angle D+\\angle F+\\angle B = 180^\\circ\\)) were not explicitly used in the argument above, once Van Aubel's theorem for polygons was invoked. However, these conditions are crucial for the existence of such a hexagon that is non-degenerate and non-self-intersecting. For example, they restrict the possible values of the angles, ensuring that the configuration is geometrically viable as described. The problem statement \"nonconvex but not self-intersecting\" also supports that the sum of oriented angles around P is \\(2\\pi\\) (not \\(0\\) or \\(4\\pi\\), etc), leading to the \\(k=1\\) (or \\(k=-1\\)) case. If the hexagon were self-intersecting, \\(P\\) might not be interpretable as a circumcenter in this way, or the argument of sum of angles might be more complex. The condition \"no pair of opposite sides are parallel\" ensures the hexagon is not centrally symmetric, in which case the concurrency is trivial with \\(P\\) being the center of symmetry and midpoint of the diagonals. Here, \\(P\\) is the circumcenter, not necessarily the midpoint of the diagonals.\n\nThus, the diagonals \\(\\overline{AD}\\), \\(\\overline{BE}\\), and \\(\\overline{CF}\\) are concurrent at the circumcenter of the hexagon.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{AD, BE, CF \\text{ are concurrent}}$.",

In particular, the side lengths are symmetric in a **rotational** fashion: each side is equal to the side three positions ahead in the hexagon.\n\nThis symmetry implies that the hexagon can be thought of as being composed of **three congruent pairs of sides**, each rotated by the same angle.\n\nFurthermore, the angle conditions:\n- $ \\angle A = 3 \\angle D $, $ \\angle C = 3 \\angle F $, $ \\angle E = 3 \\angle B $\n\nsuggest that the internal angles are also symmetric in a rotational way.\n\nThis rotational symmetry strongly implies that the hexagon can be mapped to itself under a **rotation** of $ 120^\\circ $, and that the diagonals $ \\overline{AD}, \\overline{BE}, \\overline{CF} $ all pass through the **center of rotation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Apply Desargues' Theorem**\n\nLet us now apply Desargues' Theorem to triangles $ ACE $ and $ DFB $.\n\nWe examine the intersections of the corresponding sides:\n\n- $ AC $ and $ DF $ intersect at some point $ P $\n- $ CE $ and $ FB $ intersect at some point $ Q $\n- $ EA $ and $ BD $ intersect at some point $ R $\n\nIf these three points $ P, Q, R $ are **collinear**, then the triangles $ ACE $ and $ DFB $ are **perspective from a line**, and hence, by Desargues' Theorem, the lines $ \\overline{AD}, \\overline{BE}, \\overline{CF} $ are **concurrent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Use of Symmetry to Prove Collinearity**\n\nBecause of the rotational symmetry of the hexagon, the lines $ AC $ and $ DF $, $ CE $ and $ FB $, and $ EA $ and $ BD $ are all **rotated images** of each other by $ 120^\\circ $.\n\nThis implies that the three intersection points $ P, Q, R $ lie on a common line that is invariant under the same $ 120^\\circ $ rotation.\n\nTherefore, the points $ P, Q, R $ are **collinear**, and hence, by Desargues' Theorem, the lines $ \\overline{AD}, \\overline{BE}, \\overline{CF} $ are **concurrent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe given hexagon $ ABCDEF $ has a rotational symmetry that maps the vertices $ A \\to D $, $ C \\to F $, $ E \\to B $, and the corresponding sides are equal in length and arranged in a rotational pattern. The angle conditions further support this symmetry. Using this, we apply **Desargues' Theorem** to the triangles $ ACE $ and $ DFB $, and show that the intersections of corresponding sides are collinear. Therefore, the diagonals $ \\overline{AD}, \\overline{BE}, \\overline{CF} $ are **concurrent**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{AD, BE, \\text{ and } CF \\text{ are concurrent}}\n$$",

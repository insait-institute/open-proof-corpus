Each point is colored either red or blue, with exactly $n$ red points and $n$ blue points. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, \\ldots, R_{n}$ be any ordering of the red points. Let $B_{1}$ be the nearest blue point to $R_{1}$ traveling counterclockwise around the circle starting from $R_{1}$. Then let $B_{2}$ be the nearest of the remaining blue points to $R_{2}$ travelling counterclockwise around the circle from $R_{2}$, and so on, until we have labeled all of the blue points $B_{1}$, $\\ldots, B_{n}$. Show that the number of counterclockwise arcs of the form $R_{i} \\rightarrow B_{i}$ that contain the point $(1,0)$ is independent of the way we chose the ordering $R_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}$ of the red points.\n\nWe present two solutions, one based on swapping and one based on an invariant.\n\n\u0430\u00a4\u00ac First \"local\" solution by swapping two points. Let $1 \\leq i<n$ be any index and consider the two red points $R_{i}$ and $R_{i+1}$. There are two blue points $B_{i}$ and $B_{i+1}$ associated with them.\n\nClaim - If we swap the locations of points $R_{i}$ and $R_{i+1}$ then the new $\\operatorname{arcs} R_{i} \\rightarrow B_{i}$ and $R_{i+1} \\rightarrow B_{i+1}$ will cover the same points.\n\nProof. Delete all the points $R_{1}, \\ldots, R_{i-1}$ and $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{i-1}$; instead focus on the positions of $R_{i}$ and $R_{i+1}$.\n\nThe two blue points can then be located in three possible ways: either $0,1$, or $2$ of them lie on the $\\operatorname{arc} R_{i} \\rightarrow R_{i+1}$. For each of the cases below, we illustrate on the left the locations of $B_{i}$ and $B_{i+1}$ and the corresponding arcs in green; then on the right we show the modified picture where $R_{i}$ and $R_{i+1}$ have swapped. (Note that by hypothesis there are no other blue points in the green arcs).\n\n\nObserve that in all cases, the number of arcs covering any given point on the circumference is not changed. Consequently, this proves the claim.\n\nFinally, it is enough to recall that any permutation of the red points can be achieved by swapping consecutive points (put another way: $(i i+1)$ generates the permutation group $S_{n}$ ). This solves the problem.\n\nRemark. This proof does not work if one tries to swap $R_{i}$ and $R_{j}$ if $|i-j| \\neq 1$. For example if we swapped $R_{i}$ and $R_{i+2}$ then there are some issues caused by the possible presence of the blue point $B_{i+1}$ in the green $\\operatorname{arc} R_{i+2} \\rightarrow B_{i+2}$.\n\nI Second longer solution using an invariant. Visually, if we draw all the segments $R_{i} \\rightarrow B_{i}$ then we obtain a set of $n$ chords. Say a chord is inverted if satisfies the problem condition, and stable otherwise. The problem contends that the number of stable/inverted chords depends only on the layout of the points and not on the choice of chords.\n\n\nIn fact we'll describe the number of inverted chords explicitly. Starting from $(1,0)$ we keep a running tally of $R-B$; in other words we start the counter at $0$ and decrement\nby $1$ at each blue point and increment by $1$ at each red point. Let $x \\leq 0$ be the lowest number ever recorded. Then:\n\nClaim - The number of inverted chords is $-x$ (and hence independent of the choice of chords).\n\nThis is by induction on $n$. I think the easiest thing is to delete chord $R_{1} B_{1}$; note that the arc cut out by this chord contains no blue points. So if the chord was stable certainly no change to $x$. On the other hand, if the chord is inverted, then in particular the last point before $(1,0)$ was red, and so $x<0$. In this situation one sees that deleting the chord changes $x$ to $x+1$, as desired.",

            "solution": "Proof.  We begin by replacing each point on the unit circle by its polar angle.  Since \\((1,0)\\) is excluded, we may write each of the remaining \\(2n\\) points as\n\\[\nP_k=(\\cos\\theta_k,\\sin\\theta_k),\\qquad 0<\\theta_k<2\\pi,\n\\]\nwith all the \\(\\theta_k\\) distinct.  Call exactly \\(n\\) of these angles \u201cred\u2019\u2019 and exactly \\(n\\) \u201cblue.\u2019\u2019  We regard angles modulo \\(2\\pi\\), and we orient the circle counterclockwise in the direction of increasing \\(\\theta\\).  \n\nFix any ordering \\(\\;R_1,R_2,\\dots,R_n\\;\\) of the red points, and apply the greedy matching rule:\n\n\u2022 Let \\(S_1\\) be the set of all blue angles.  \n\u2022 For \\(i=1,2,\\dots,n\\), having defined \\(S_i\\), let \\(R_i\\) have polar angle \\(\\alpha_i\\), and define\n\\[\nB_i\n=\\begin{cases}\n\\min\\{\\,s\\in S_i: s>\\alpha_i\\}, &\\text{if }S_i\\cap(\\alpha_i,2\\pi)\\neq\\emptyset,\\\\\n\\min S_i, &\\text{if }S_i\\cap(\\alpha_i,2\\pi)=\\emptyset,\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \u201c\\(\\min\\)\u201d means the least element in the usual order on \\((0,2\\pi)\\).  Then set \\(S_{i+1}=S_i\\setminus\\{B_i\\}\\).  \n\nThus each red \\(R_i\\) at angle \\(\\alpha_i\\) is matched to the nearest remaining blue \\(B_i\\) going counterclockwise from \\(\\alpha_i\\).

Thus \\(T_{\\rm orig}=T_{\\rm swap}\\).  This proves that swapping two adjacent reds does not change the total number of arcs crossing \\((1,0)\\).  \n\nSince any two orderings of the red points differ by a finite sequence of such adjacent swaps, the number of CCW arcs \\(R_i\\to B_i\\) containing \\((1,0)\\) is the same for every ordering.

It does **not** depend on the order in which red points are processed, nor on the specific greedy assignment algorithm used, as long as it is a valid greedy counterclockwise assignment.\n\nIn any greedy matching, the number of arcs that \"wrap around\" the point $ (1,0) $ is exactly the number of times the imbalance $ S(\\theta) $ dips below zero. This is precisely $ -m $, which is fixed for the given configuration.\n\nThus, regardless of how we order the red points and assign blue points greedily in the counterclockwise direction, the number of arcs that contain $ (1,0) $ is always $ K = -m $, a value that is **independent of the ordering of red points**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe number of counterclockwise arcs $ R_i \\rightarrow B_i $ that contain the point $ (1,0) $ is determined solely by the circular arrangement of red and blue points. This number is equal to $ -m $, where $ m $ is the minimum imbalance of red and blue points in the arc from $ (1,0) $ to any point on the circle.\n\nSince $ m $ is independent of the red point ordering, the number of such arcs is also independent of the red point ordering.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{constant}}\n$$",

The given \\(2n\\) distinct points \\(P_1, \\ldots, P_{2n}\\) have angles in \\((0, 2\\pi)\\). Let \\(R\\) be the set of \\(n\\) red points and \\(B\\) be the set of \\(n\\) blue points.\n\nLet \\(\\theta(P)\\) denote the angle of a point \\(P\\). An arc from point \\(A\\) to point \\(S\\) (denoted \\(A \\to S\\)) is counterclockwise (CCW). This arc contains \\(P_0\\) if and only if \\(\\theta(A) > \\theta(S)\\). We define \\(w(A,S) = 1\\) if \\(\\theta(A) > \\theta(S)\\) and \\(w(A,S) = 0\\) if \\(\\theta(A) < \\theta(S)\\). Note that \\(\\theta(A) \\neq \\theta(S)\\) since all points are distinct.\n\nThe procedure for labeling blue points is as follows: Given an ordering of red points \\((R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_n)\\), let \\(B_{used, k-1} = \\{B_1, \\ldots, B_{k-1}\\}\\) be the set of blue points already assigned to \\(R_1, \\ldots, R_{k-1}\\). \\(B_k\\) is chosen for \\(R_k\\) from the set of available blue points \\(B \\setminus B_{used, k-1}\\) such that the CCW angle from \\(R_k\\) to \\(B_k\\) is minimized. Let this minimized CCW angle be $d(R_k, B_k) = (\\theta(B_k) - \\theta(R_k) + 2\\pi) \\pmod{2\\pi}$.\n\nWe want to show that the total number of arcs \\(R_k \\to B_k\\) that contain \\(P_0\\), which is \\(N = \\sum_{k=1}^n w(R_k, B_k)\\), is independent of the chosen ordering of red points.\n\nIt is sufficient to prove that $N$ remains unchanged if we swap two adjacent red points in the ordering. Any permutation can be obtained by a sequence of adjacent swaps. Let the original ordering be \\(L = (R_1, \\ldots, R_i, R_{i+1}, \\ldots, R_n)\\) and the new ordering be \\(L' = (R_1, \\ldots, R_{i+1}, R_i, \\ldots, R_n)\\).\nLet \\(R_A = R_i\\) and \\(R_B = R_{i+1}\\) in the original ordering $L$. So $L'$ has $R_B$ then $R_A$ at these positions.\n\nThe blue points \\(B_1, \\ldots, B_{i-1}\\) are identical for both orderings. Let \\(S = \\{B_1, \\ldots, B_{i-1}\\}\\) be this set of already assigned blue points. Let \\(C = B \\setminus S\\) be the set of currently available blue points for \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_B\\).\n\nIn ordering \\(L\\):\n1. \\(R_A\\) is assigned $B_A = \\text{argmin}_{X \\in C} d(R_A, X)$.\n2. \\(R_B\\) is assigned $B_B = \\text{argmin}_{X \\in C \\setminus \\{B_A\\}} d(R_B, X)$.\nThe contribution to the sum from these two pairings is \\(W_L = w(R_A, B_A) + w(R_B, B_B)\\). The set of blue points chosen for these two steps is \\(\\{B_A, B_B\\}\\).\n\nIn ordering \\(L'\\): (Here, \\(R_B\\) is processed first, then \\(R_A\\))\n1. \\(R_B\\) is assigned $B'_B = \\text{argmin}_{X \\in C} d(R_B, X)$. (This is $B'_i$ in $L'$)\n2. \\(R_A\\) is assigned $B'_A = \\text{argmin}_{X \\in C \\setminus \\{B'_B\\}} d(R_A, X)$. (This is $B'_{i+1}$ in $L'$)\nThe contribution to the sum from these two pairings is \\(W_{L'} = w(R_B, B'_B) + w(R_A, B'_A)\\). The set of blue points chosen for these two steps is \\(\\{B'_B, B'_A\\}\\).\n\nTo show that the total sum \\(N\\) is invariant, we must show two things:\n1. The set of blue points chosen for \\(R_A, R_B\\) is the same in both cases, i.e., \\(\\{B_A, B_B\\} = \\{B'_B, B'_A\\}\\). This ensures that the set of available blue points for \\(R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_n\\) is the same, and since the red points \\(R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_n\\) are also in the same order, the subsequent pairings \\((R_j, B_j)\\) for \\(j > i+1\\) will be identical in both cases.\n2. The sum of wraps for the swapped pair is conserved: \\(w(R_A, B_A) + w(R_B, B_B) = w(R_B, B'_B) + w(R_A, B'_A)\\).\n\nWe analyze two cases:\n\nCase 1: \\(B_A \\neq B'_B\\).\nLet \\(B_A = X\\) and \\(B'_B = Y\\), where \\(X, Y \\in C\\) and \\(X \\neq Y\\).\nThe choice of \\(B_A=X\\) means \\(X\\) is the CCW-closest blue point in \\(C\\) to \\(R_A\\). In particular, \\(d(R_A, X) < d(R_A, Y)\\) (unless \\(Y\\) was not available, but it is, $Y \\in C$).\nThe choice of \\(B'_B=Y\\) means \\(Y\\) is the CCW-closest blue point in \\(C\\) to \\(R_B\\). In particular, \\(d(R_B, Y) < d(R_B, X)\\).\n\nFor ordering \\(L\\), after \\(R_A\\) is paired with \\(X\\), \\(R_B\\) is paired with a point from \\(C \\setminus \\{X\\}\\). Since \\(Y \\in C\\) and \\(Y \\neq X\\), \\(Y\\) is available. Since \\(Y\\) is \\(R_B\\)'s first choice from \\(C\\) and \\(d(R_B,Y) < d(R_B,X)\\), \\(Y\\) must be \\(R_B\\)'s first choice from \\(C \\setminus \\{X\\}\\) (as \\(X\\) is \"further\" than \\(Y\\) for \\(R_B\\)). So, \\(B_B = Y\\).\nThe pairs for \\(L\\) are \\((R_A, X)\\) and \\((R_B, Y)\\). The set of chosen blue points is \\(\\{X, Y\\}\\).\n\nFor ordering \\(L'\\), after \\(R_B\\) is paired with \\(Y\\), \\(R_A\\) is paired with a point from \\(C \\setminus \\{Y\\}\\). Since \\(X \\in C\\) and \\(X \\neq Y\\), \\(X\\) is available. Since \\(X\\) is \\(R_A\\)'s first choice from \\(C\\) and \\(d(R_A,X) < d(R_A,Y)\\), \\(X\\) must be \\(R_A\\)'s first choice from \\(C \\setminus \\{Y\\}\\). So, \\(B'_A = X\\).\nThe pairs for \\(L'\\) are \\((R_B, Y)\\) and \\((R_A, X)\\). The set of chosen blue points is \\(\\{Y, X\\}\\).\n\nIn this case:\n1. The set of chosen blue points \\(\\{X,Y\\}\\) is the same for both orderings. Thus, the subsequent pairings and their contributions to the sum are identical.\n2. The contribution from these two pairs to the sum is \\(w(R_A, X) + w(R_B, Y)\\) for \\(L\\), and \\(w(R_B, Y) + w(R_A, X)\\) for \\(L'\\). These sums are clearly equal.\nSo, if \\(B_A \\neq B'_B\\), the total sum \\(N\\) is invariant.\n\nCase 2: \\(B_A = B'_B\\).\nLet \\(X = B_A = B'_B\\). This means \\(X\\) is the CCW-closest blue point in \\(C\\) to \\(R_A\\), and \\(X\\) is also the CCW-closest blue point in \\(C\\) to \\(R_B\\).\nFor ordering \\(L\\): $R_A$ is paired with $X$. $R_B$ is then paired with $B_B = \\text{argmin}_{P \\in C \\setminus \\{X\\}} d(R_B, P)$.\nThe pairs for $L$ are $(R_A, X)$ and $(R_B, B_B)$. Set of chosen blue points is $\\{X, B_B\\}$.\nFor ordering $L'$: $R_B$ is paired with $X$. $R_A$ is then paired with $B'_A = \\text{argmin}_{P \\in C \\setminus \\{X\\}} d(R_A, P)$.\nThe pairs for $L'$ are $(R_B, X)$ and $(R_A, B'_A)$. Set of chosen blue points is $\\{X, B'_A\\}$.\n\nLet's analyze $B_B$ and $B'_A$.\n$X$ being the first blue point from $C$ CCW from $R_A$ means that the arc $(R_A, X)$ (CCW from $R_A$ to $X$) contains no points from $C$.\nSimilarly, the arc $(R_B, X)$ contains no points from $C$.\nThis implies that $B_B$, the first blue point in $C \\setminus \\{X\\}$ CCW from $R_B$, must be the first blue point in $C \\setminus \\{X\\}$ CCW from $X$. To see this, the path from $R_B$ to $B_B$ cannot cross $X$ if $X$ is its \"first choice\". More precisely, $R_B \\to X \\to B_B$ forms its path.\nSo $B_B$ is the first point in $C \\setminus \\{X\\}$ encountered when sweeping CCW starting from $X$.\nSimilarly, $B'_A$ is the first point in $C \\setminus \\{X\\}$ encountered when sweeping CCW starting from $X$.\nThus, $B_B = B'_A$. Let $Y = B_B = B'_A$.\n\nSo, in this case:\n1. The pairs for $L$ are $(R_A, X)$ and $(R_B, Y)$. The set of chosen blue points is $\\{X, Y\\}$.\n2. The pairs for $L'$ are $(R_B, X)$ and $(R_A, Y)$. The set of chosen blue points is $\\{X, Y\\}$.\nThe set of chosen blue points is the same. Thus, subsequent pairings are identical.\nWe now need to check if $w(R_A, X) + w(R_B, Y) = w(R_B, X) + w(R_A, Y)$. This is equivalent to showing $w(R_A, X) - w(R_A, Y) = w(R_B, X) - w(R_B, Y)$.\nLet $J(P, X, Y) = w(P, X) - w(P, Y)$. We need to show $J(R_A, X, Y) = J(R_B, X, Y)$.\n\nLet $\\theta_P, \\theta_X, \\theta_Y$ be the angles in $(0, 2\\pi)$ for points $P,X,Y$. Recall $w(P,Q)=1$ if $\\theta_P > \\theta_Q$, and $w(P,Q)=0$ if $\\theta_P < \\theta_Q$.\nThe condition that $X$ is the first point in $C$ from $P$ (where $P$ is $R_A$ or $R_B$) and $Y$ is the first point in $C \\setminus \\{X\\}$ from $P$ means that $P$ must lie on the arc $Y \\to X$ (the CCW arc from $Y$ to $X$ that does not contain other points of $C \\setminus \\{X,Y\\}$). Otherwise, if $P$ was on the arc $X \\to Y$, then $Y$ (or other points on $X \\to Y$) would be closer to $P$ than $X$, which contradicts that $X$ is the closest.\n\nWe examine $J(P,X,Y)$ based on the relative order of $\\theta_P, \\theta_X, \\theta_Y$ and $P_0$ (angle 0).\nSubcase 2a: $\\theta_X < \\theta_Y$. (Arc $X \\to Y$ does not contain $P_0$; arc $Y \\to X$ does contain $P_0$).\nSince $P$ is on arc $Y \\to X$, $\\theta_P \\in (\\theta_Y, 2\\pi) \\cup (0, \\theta_X)$.\nIf $\\theta_P \\in (\\theta_Y, 2\\pi)$: Then $\\theta_P > \\theta_Y$ (so $w(P,Y)=1$) and $\\theta_P > \\theta_X$ (so $w(P,X)=1$). Thus $J(P,X,Y) = 1-1 = 0$.\nIf $\\theta_P \\in (0, \\theta_X)$: Then $\\theta_P < \\theta_Y$ (so $w(P,Y)=0$) and $\\theta_P < \\theta_X$ (so $w(P,X)=0$). Thus $J(P,X,Y) = 0-0 = 0$.\nIn both possibilities for $P$ within arc $Y \\to X$, $J(P,X,Y)=0$. So $J(R_A,X,Y)=0$ and $J(R_B,X,Y)=0$. They are equal.\n\nSubcase 2b: $\\theta_Y < \\theta_X$. (Arc $X \\to Y$ contains $P_0$; arc $Y \\to X$ does not contain $P_0$).\nSince $P$ is on arc $Y \\to X$, $\\theta_P \\in (\\theta_Y, \\theta_X)$.\nFor any such $P$, we have $\\theta_Y < \\theta_P < \\theta_X$.\nThen $w(P,X)=0$ (since $\\theta_P < \\theta_X$) and $w(P,Y)=1$ (since $\\theta_P > \\theta_Y$).\nThus $J(P,X,Y) = 0-1 = -1$.\nSo $J(R_A,X,Y)=-1$ and $J(R_B,X,Y)=-1$. They are equal.\n\nIn both subcases (relative ordering of $\\theta_X, \\theta_Y$), $J(R_A,X,Y) = J(R_B,X,Y)$.\nThis means $w(R_A,X) - w(R_A,Y) = w(R_B,X) - w(R_B,Y)$, which rearranges to $w(R_A,X) + w(R_B,Y) = w(R_B,X) + w(R_A,Y)$.\nSo the sum of wraps from these two pairs is conserved.\n\nIn both Case 1 and Case 2, swapping adjacent red points $R_A, R_B$ leads to:\n1. The set of blue points chosen for $R_A, R_B$ is $\\{X,Y\\}$ in some assignment. This means the set of available blue points for subsequent red points $R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_n$ remains unchanged.\n2. The pairings for $R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_n$ are therefore identical.\n3. The sum of contributions to $N$ from $R_A, R_B$ (i.e., $w(R_A,B_A)+w(R_B,B_B)$ vs $w(R_B,B'_B)+w(R_A,B'_A)$) is the same.\n\nSince any permutation of $(R_1, \\ldots, R_n)$ can be reached by a sequence of adjacent swaps, and each such swap preserves the total number of wraps $N$, the value of $N$ is independent of the initial ordering of the red points.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{The number of counterclockwise arcs of the form R_i \\rightarrow B_i that contain the point (1,0) is independent of the way we chose the ordering R_1, \\ldots, R_n of the red points.}$.",

Completing the proof.\n\nStarting from \\((r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})\\) we perform, at every step,\n{\\em any} legal move; the integer (8) decreases strictly each time, hence\nonly finitely many moves are possible.  \nAs shown in Section 5 the only position in which no further move can be\ncarried out is the one that contains a \\(0\\).\nTherefore, after a finite number of operations, the blackboard must\nindeed contain the number \\(0\\).\n\nThis finishes the proof. \u220e",

This suggests a strategy of iteratively reducing the numbers until one becomes zero.\n- The problem allows us to assume that the coefficients $ a_1, a_2, a_3 $ are **coprime integers**. If not, we can divide through by their greatest common divisor, as the relation remains valid.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\nWe proceed by **induction on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients**, denoted:\n\n$$\nS = |a_1| + |a_2| + |a_3|.\n$$\n\nThis sum is a **positive integer**, since the coefficients are not all zero.\n\n---\n\n### Base Case\n\nSuppose $ S = 1 $. This implies that exactly one of the coefficients is $ \\pm 1 $, and the other two are zero. Then the relation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\pm r_i = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_i = 0.\n$$\n\nSo at least one number is zero, and we are done.\n\n---\n\n### Inductive Step\n\nAssume the statement holds for all such problems where the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients is less than $ S $. We now consider the case when the sum is exactly $ S $, and all $ r_i > 0 $, and no two numbers are equal (otherwise, we can immediately obtain a zero by subtracting equal numbers).\n\nWe can assume without loss of generality that the relation is:\n\n$$\na_1r_1 + a_2r_2 = a_3r_3,\n$$\n\nwhere $ a_1, a_2, a_3 $ are **positive integers**, and $ a_1 + a_2 \\geq a_3 $ (this follows from the fact that $ r_3 \\geq r_2 \\geq r_1 $, and the left-hand side is at least $ a_1r_1 + a_2r_1 = (a_1 + a_2)r_1 \\leq a_1r_1 + a_2r_2 = a_3r_3 $, so $ a_3 \\leq a_1 + a_2 $).\n\n---\n\n### Applying the Operation\n\nLet us now perform the operation on $ r_3 $ and $ r_1 $, since $ r_1 \\leq r_3 $. Replace $ r_3 $ with $ r_3' = r_3 - r_1 $. The new relation becomes:\n\n$$\na_1r_1 + a_2r_2 = a_3(r_3' + r_1) = a_3r_3' + a_3r_1.\n$$\n\nRewriting:\n\n$$\n(a_1 - a_3)r_1 + a_2r_2 = a_3r_3'.\n$$\n\nNow, the new coefficients are $ (a_1 - a_3, a_2, a_3) $, and the new sum of absolute values is:\n\n$$\n|a_1 - a_3| + a_2 + a_3.\n$$\n\nWe now analyze two cases:\n\n#### Case 1: $ a_1 \\geq a_3 $\n\nThen $ |a_1 - a_3| = a_1 - a_3 $, so the new sum is:\n\n$$\n(a_1 - a_3) + a_2 + a_3 = a_1 + a_2 < a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = S.\n$$\n\nSo the sum has decreased, and we can apply the inductive hypothesis.\n\n#### Case 2: $ a_1 < a_3 $\n\nThen $ |a_1 - a_3| = a_3 - a_1 $, and the new sum is:\n\n$$\n(a_3 - a_1) + a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + 2a_3 - a_1.\n$$\n\nThis may or may not be less than $ S $, depending on the values of the coefficients. However, we can rearrange the new relation:\n\n$$\na_2r_2 = (a_3 - a_1)r_1 + a_3r_3'.\n$$\n\nNow, the new coefficients are $ (a_3 - a_1, a_2, a_3) $, and the sum is again:\n\n$$\n|a_3 - a_1| + a_2 + a_3 = (a_3 - a_1) + a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + 2a_3 - a_1.\n$$\n\nThis is still a positive integer, and the sum is strictly less than $ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 $, since $ a_1 > 0 $.\n\nThus, in both cases, the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients has strictly decreased, and we can apply the inductive hypothesis to the new triple $ (r_1, r_2, r_3') $, which satisfies a new integer linear relation with a smaller sum.\n\n---\n\n### Termination\n\nAt each step, the sum $ S $ strictly decreases. Since $ S $ is a positive integer, it must eventually reach 1, at which point the inductive hypothesis guarantees the existence of a zero. Therefore, the process must terminate in a finite number of steps with at least one zero on the board.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy induction on the sum of the absolute values of the integer coefficients in the relation, we have shown that a finite number of operations will always result in at least one zero on the board.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$",

So, any operation that changes the state must involve choosing \\(x > 0\\).\n\nLet \\(L_0 = \\{k_1 r_1 + k_2 r_2 + k_3 r_3 \\mid k_1, k_2, k_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\) be the \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-module generated by the initial numbers \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\).\nAny number on the blackboard is an element of \\(L_0\\). This is true initially. If we have \\(x, y, z \\in L_0\\) and replace \\(y\\) with \\(y-x\\), then \\(y-x \\in L_0\\) since \\(x, y \\in L_0\\). So all numbers on the blackboard are always elements of \\(L_0\\).\nThe given condition is that \\(0 \\in L_0\\) via a non-trivial combination \\(a_1 r_1 + a_2 r_2 + a_3 r_3 = 0\\).\n\nLet \\(S = x_1+x_2+x_3\\) be the sum of the numbers on the blackboard. If we choose \\(x,y\\) with \\(0 < x \\le y\\), and replace \\(y\\) by \\(y-x\\), the sum changes from \\(S\\) to \\(S-x\\). Since \\(x>0\\), the sum strictly decreases.\nSince the numbers are always non-negative, the sum \\(S\\) is bounded below by 0. Therefore, the sequence of sums generated by repeated operations converges.\nIf the process does not terminate, it means we can always choose \\(x,y\\) with \\(x>0\\). The sum \\(S\\) strictly decreases. This implies that the subtracted value \\(x\\) must converge to 0. (If \\(x\\) were bounded below by some \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), then \\(S\\) would decrease by at least \\(\\epsilon\\) at each step involving that \\(x\\), or another \\(x' \\ge \\epsilon\\). If all possible \\(x\\) are \\(\\ge \\epsilon\\), then \\(S\\) decreases by at least \\(\\epsilon\\) each step, which means \\(S\\) would eventually become negative, a contradiction. So the smallest chosen \\(x\\) must converge to 0).\nSo, if the process runs indefinitely, at least one number on the blackboard must approach 0. Let \\(x_k\\) denote the smallest number on the board at step \\(k\\). Then \\(x_k \\to 0\\) as \\(k \\to \\infty\\).\n\nThe core of the argument relies on the properties of \\(L_0\\). \\(L_0\\) is a \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-submodule of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nThe structure of such modules is known:\n1.  \\(L_0 = \\{0\\}\\). In this case, \\(r_1=r_2=r_3=0\\). We start with zeros.\n2.  \\(L_0\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). This means \\(L_0 = g\\mathbb{Z} = \\{kg \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\) for some \\(g \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Since \\(r_i \\ge 0\\), we can assume \\(g>0\\). In this case, all numbers \\(x_1,x_2,x_3\\) on the blackboard are non-negative integer multiples of \\(g\\). Any \\(x \\in L_0\\) with \\(x>0\\) must satisfy \\(x \\ge g\\). So, if a subtracted value \\(x\\) converges to 0, it must eventually be 0. If \\(x=0\\) is chosen, then we have found a zero. If the process stops without choosing \\(x=0\\), it must be because all numbers that can be chosen as \\(x\\) (the smaller in a pair) are zero. If we always choose \\(x>0\\), then the sum \\(S\\) decreases by at least \\(g\\) at each step. Since \\(S \\ge 0\\), this process must terminate. Termination means no \\(x>0\\) can be chosen to be subtracted from some \\(y \\ge x\\). This happens if at most one non-zero number remains, or if the only \\(x\\) available to be chosen as the smaller number is \\(x=0\\). In either case, we have a zero. For example, if the numbers are \\((0,0,0)\\), \\((0,0,z)\\), \\((0,y,z)\\), we are done. If the numbers are \\((x,y,z)\\) with \\(x>0\\), then we can choose \\(x\\) and some \\(y' \\ge x\\), and the sum decreases by \\(x \\ge g\\). This process must terminate.\n\n3.  \\(L_0\\) is dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). This happens if \\(L_0\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^d\\) for \\(d \\ge 2\\). (e.g. \\(L_0 = \\{k_1 + k_2\\sqrt{2} \\mid k_1,k_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\)). In this case, there are positive elements in \\(L_0\\) arbitrarily close to 0. The argument that \"subtracted value \\(x \\to 0\\) implies \\(x\\) becomes 0\" is not directly applicable.\n\nLet \\(V = \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(r_1, r_2, r_3)\\) be the vector space over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) spanned by \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\).\nThe condition \\(a_1 r_1 + a_2 r_2 + a_3 r_3 = 0\\) for integers \\(a_i\\) not all zero means that \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\) are linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\nThus, the dimension of \\(V\\) is less than 3. \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V) \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\).\n\nCase 1: \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=0\\). This means \\(r_1=r_2=r_3=0\\). We start with three zeros. The claim holds.\n\nCase 2: \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=1\\). There exists \\(\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(r_i = q_i \\beta\\) for \\(q_i \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). We can assume \\(\\beta > 0\\) (if \\(\\beta=0\\), then \\(r_i=0\\), which is Case 1).\nThe numbers on the blackboard are \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\). Each \\(x_j\\) is an integer linear combination of \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\), so \\(x_j = (\\sum k_{ji} q_i) \\beta\\). Let \\(q'_j = \\sum k_{ji} q_i\\), so \\(x_j=q'_j \\beta\\). The coefficients \\(q'_j\\) are rational numbers.\nLet \\(D\\) be a common denominator for \\(q'_1, q'_2, q'_3\\) (e.g. the product of denominators of \\(q_1,q_2,q_3\\)). Then \\(x_j = (N_j/D) \\beta\\) for integers \\(N_j\\).\nThe operation \\(y \\leftarrow y-x\\) (assume \\(x \\le y\\)) corresponds to \\( (N_y/D)\\beta \\leftarrow (N_y/D)\\beta - (N_x/D)\\beta = ((N_y-N_x)/D)\\beta \\).\nThis means the algorithm is equivalent to performing the operations on integer coefficients \\(N_x, N_y, N_z\\) (scaled by \\(\\beta/D\\)).\nThe numbers are \\(n_1 g, n_2 g, n_3 g\\) where \\(g = \\beta/D\\) and \\(n_i\\) are integers. All numbers on the blackboard will be integer multiples of \\(g\\).\nSince all \\(x_j \\ge 0\\), all \\(n_j \\ge 0\\).\nIf we start with \\(n_1,n_2,n_3\\) positive integers, the sum \\(n_1+n_2+n_3\\) is a positive integer. Each operation \\(n_y \\leftarrow n_y-n_x\\) (where \\(n_x \\le n_y\\) and \\(n_x>0\\)) makes the sum decrease by \\(n_x \\ge 1\\).\nThis process must terminate. When it terminates, we must have used \\(n_x=0\\) for a subtraction (in which case a zero is present and the state doesn't change) or it's impossible to pick \\(n_x > 0\\). This means any number that can be a subtrahend is 0. For example, if numbers are sorted \\(x_1 \\le x_2 \\le x_3\\), then \\(x_1=0\\). Thus, a zero is on the blackboard.\nThis covers the case where \\(L_0\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nCase 3: \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=2\\). There exist \\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) linearly independent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) such that each \\(r_i = q_{i1}\\beta_1 + q_{i2}\\beta_2\\) for \\(q_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). WLOG, assume \\(\\beta_1 > 0, \\beta_2 > 0\\) (if not, adjustments can be made to the basis, e.g. using \\(-\\beta_2\\); if \\(\\beta_1/\\beta_2 < 0\\), the argument is similar but vectors live in a different cone).\nEach number \\(x_j\\) on the blackboard is an integer linear combination of \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\), so it has the form \\(x_j = q'_{j1}\\beta_1 + q'_{j2}\\beta_2\\) where \\(q'_{jk} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\nLet \\(D\\) be a common denominator for all \\(q'_{jk}\\) that appear. Then \\(D x_j = N_{j1}\\beta_1 + N_{j2}\\beta_2\\) for integers \\(N_{j1}, N_{j2}\\).\nLet \\(V_j = (N_{j1}, N_{j2})\\) be the vector of integer coefficients corresponding to \\(x_j\\).\nThe operation \\(x_k \\leftarrow x_k-x_j\\) (where \\(x_j \\le x_k\\)) corresponds to \\(V_k \\leftarrow V_k-V_j\\).\nAll \\(x_j \\ge 0\\), so \\(N_{j1}\\beta_1 + N_{j2}\\beta_2 \\ge 0\\). This means the vectors \\(V_j\\) lie in a half-plane defined by the line \\(u\\beta_1+v\\beta_2=0\\). Since \\(\\beta_1/\\beta_2\\) is irrational (as \\(\\beta_1,\\beta_2\\) are \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)-linearly independent), this line passes through the origin \\((0,0)\\) but no other integer lattice points \\((N_1,N_2) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}\\).\nThus, \\(x_j=0\\) if and only if \\(V_j=(0,0)\\). If \\(x_j>0\\), then \\(V_j \\ne (0,0)\\) and \\(N_{j1}\\beta_1+N_{j2}\\beta_2 > 0\\).\nThe initial relation \\(\\sum a_i r_i = 0\\) implies \\(\\sum a_i V_i = (0,0)\\) (after scaling by \\(D\\)). That is, the initial integer vectors \\(V_1,V_2,V_3\\) are linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\nThis means that \\(V_1, V_2, V_3\\) lie in a rank-1 submodule of \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\). In other words, they are collinear: they all lie on a single line through the origin. Let this line be generated by a primitive vector \\(W \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2\\). So \\(V_j = k_j W\\) for integers \\(k_j\\).\nThen \\(D x_j = (k_j N_{W1})\\beta_1 + (k_j N_{W2})\\beta_2 = k_j (N_{W1}\\beta_1+N_{W2}\\beta_2)\\).\nLet \\(\\beta' = N_{W1}\\beta_1+N_{W2}\\beta_2\\). Then \\(D x_j = k_j \\beta'\\).\nSo \\(x_j = k_j (\\beta'/D)\\). All numbers on the blackboard are integer multiples of \\(g = \\beta'/D\\).\nSince \\(x_j \\ge 0\\) and we assumed \\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2 > 0\\), we need to ensure \\(\\beta'\\) is not zero. If \\(\\beta'=0\\), then \\(N_{W1}\\beta_1+N_{W2}\\beta_2=0\\). Since \\(\\beta_1/\\beta_2\\) is irrational and \\(\\beta_1,\\beta_2 \\ne 0\\), this implies \\(N_{W1}=N_{W2}=0\\), so \\(W=(0,0)\\). This would mean all \\(V_j=(0,0)\\), so all \\(x_j=0\\), which is Case 1. So assume \\(W \\ne (0,0)\\), hence \\(\\beta' \\ne 0\\). If \\(\\beta'<0\\), we can use \\(-\\beta'\\) by changing sign of \\(k_j\\). So we have \\(x_j = k_j' g\\) where \\(k_j' \\ge 0\\) are integers and \\(g>0\\).\nThis reduces Case 3 to Case 2: all numbers on the board are integer multiples of some positive real number \\(g\\). As shown for Case 2, the process must terminate with a zero on the blackboard.\n\nTo be more explicit on \"collinear\": The vectors \\(V_1, V_2, V_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) satisfy \\(\\sum a_i V_i = 0\\), where \\(a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) are not all zero. This means they are linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). If \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) is the module, any set of three vectors is linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). For instance, if \\(V_1, V_2\\) are linearly independent, they form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) (if primitive enough, or for a submodule of \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\)). Then \\(V_3 = c_1 V_1 + c_2 V_2\\) for \\(c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). The relation \\(\\sum a_i V_i = 0\\) means \\((a_1+a_3c_1)V_1 + (a_2+a_3c_2)V_2 = 0\\). Since \\(V_1, V_2\\) are linearly independent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) (as they are over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)), it implies \\(a_1+a_3c_1=0\\) and \\(a_2+a_3c_2=0\\). So \\(c_1 = -a_1/a_3\\) and \\(c_2 = -a_2/a_3\\) (assuming \\(a_3 \\ne 0\\)). Thus \\(a_3 V_3 = -a_1 V_1 - a_2 V_2\\). This implies \\(V_3\\) lies in the module generated by \\(V_1, V_2\\). This does not imply they are collinear. For example, \\(V_1=(1,0), V_2=(0,1), V_3=(1,1)\\). They satisfy \\(V_1+V_2-V_3=0\\). These are not collinear.\nThe argument for reducing Case 3 to Case 2 needs refinement.\nThe \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-module \\(L_0\\) is \\( \\{ (k_1 q_{11}+k_2 q_{21}+k_3 q_{31})\\beta_1 + (k_1 q_{12}+k_2 q_{22}+k_3 q_{32})\\beta_2 \\mid k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} \\).\nLet \\(Q_j = (q_{1j}, q_{2j}, q_{3j})\\). The condition \\(\\sum a_i r_i=0\\) means \\(\\sum_i a_i (q_{i1}\\beta_1+q_{i2}\\beta_2) = (\\sum_i a_i q_{i1})\\beta_1 + (\\sum_i a_i q_{i2})\\beta_2 = 0\\).\nSince \\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2\\) are \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)-linearly independent, we have \\(\\sum_i a_i q_{i1} = 0\\) and \\(\\sum_i a_i q_{i2} = 0\\).\nThis means the vectors \\((q_{i1})_{i=1}^3\\) and \\((q_{i2})_{i=1}^3\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Q}^3\\) are both orthogonal to the vector \\((a_1,a_2,a_3)\\). These two vectors in \\(\\mathbb{Q}^3\\), let's call them \\(U_1, U_2\\), are \\(U_1 = (q_{11},q_{21},q_{31})\\) and \\(U_2 = (q_{12},q_{22},q_{32})\\).\nAny element \\(x \\in L_0\\) is \\(x = \\sum k_i r_i = (\\vec{k} \\cdot U_1)\\beta_1 + (\\vec{k} \\cdot U_2)\\beta_2\\), where \\(\\vec{k}=(k_1,k_2,k_3)\\).\nThe vectors \\(U_1, U_2\\) are in the subspace orthogonal to \\(\\vec{a}\\), which is a 2D space. So \\(U_1, U_2\\) are themselves linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) or they span this 2D space.\nIf \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\) are linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), say \\(U_2 = c U_1\\) for \\(c \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) (assume \\(U_1 \\ne 0\\)). Then \\(q_{i2}=c q_{i1}\\) for all \\(i\\).\nSo \\(r_i = q_{i1}\\beta_1 + c q_{i1}\\beta_2 = q_{i1}(\\beta_1+c\\beta_2)\\).\nThis means all \\(r_i\\) are rational multiples of a single real number \\(\\beta' = \\beta_1+c\\beta_2\\). This is Case 2 (\\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=1\\)).\nWhat if \\(U_1 = 0\\)? Then all \\(q_{i1}=0\\). So \\(r_i = q_{i2}\\beta_2\\). This is Case 2. Similarly if \\(U_2=0\\).\n\nSo, if \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=2\\), then \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\) must be linearly independent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\nThe values on the blackboard are \\(x_j = (\\vec{k}_j \\cdot U_1)\\beta_1 + (\\vec{k}_j \\cdot U_2)\\beta_2\\). Here \\(\\vec{k}_j\\) are the coefficient vectors that express \\(x_j\\) in terms of \\(r_1,r_2,r_3\\). Initially, \\(\\vec{k}_1=(1,0,0), \\vec{k}_2=(0,1,0), \\vec{k}_3=(0,0,1)\\).\nAn operation \\(x_b \\leftarrow x_b-x_a\\) corresponds to \\(\\vec{k}_b \\leftarrow \\vec{k}_b-\\vec{k}_a\\).\nThis framework does not seem to simplify to Case 2 directly without the collinearity argument, which was flawed.\n\nLet's re-state: the initial numbers \\(r_1,r_2,r_3\\) are linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). If \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\text{span}(r_1,r_2,r_3)=1\\), we are done.\nIf \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\text{span}(r_1,r_2,r_3)=2\\), then \\(r_1,r_2,r_3\\) belong to a module \\(M' = \\alpha_1 \\mathbb{Z} + \\alpha_2 \\mathbb{Z}\\) for some \\(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\) linearly independent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) only if \\(r_i\\) are themselves elements of such a module from the start by being rational linear combinations of \\(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\) and then clearing denominators. More accurately, \\(L_0 \\subseteq \\alpha_1 \\mathbb{Q} + \\alpha_2 \\mathbb{Q}\\). Clearing denominators means there is a \\(D \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(D \\cdot L_0 \\subseteq \\alpha_1 \\mathbb{Z} + \\alpha_2 \\mathbb{Z}\\). Let \\(L_D = D \\cdot L_0\\). \\(L_D\\) is a \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-module.\nThe elements \\(Dx_i\\) are of the form \\(n_1\\alpha_1+n_2\\alpha_2\\). The arguments from standard proofs of termination of vector Euclidean algorithms would apply here by mapping \\(Dx_i\\) to \\((n_1,n_2)\\). These proofs usually involve induction on the dimension or on some norm, and are not elementary.\n\nA simpler argument using the coefficients \\(a_i\\) may be required.\nAs established, \\(a_i\\) cannot all have the same sign if \\(r_i>0\\). So assume \\(a_1>0, a_2 \\le 0, a_3 \\le 0\\) (not both zero). Then \\(a_1 r_1 = (-a_2)r_2 + (-a_3)r_3\\). Let \\(A_i = |a_i|\\). So \\(A_1 r_1 = A_2 r_2 + A_3 r_3\\).\nOr \\(A_1 r_1 + A_2 r_2 = A_3 r_3\\). Let's use this form. The numbers \\(x,y,z\\) currently on the board are positive elements of \\(L_0\\).\nConsider the value \\(L = A_1 x_1 + A_2 x_2 - A_3 x_3\\). This value is in \\(L_0\\). Initially, \\(L=0\\).\nIf we replace \\(x_1\\) by \\(x_1-x_2\\) (assuming \\(x_2 \\le x_1\\)): New value is \\(L' = A_1(x_1-x_2)+A_2 x_2 - A_3 x_3 = L - A_1 x_2\\).\nIf we replace \\(x_3\\) by \\(x_3-x_1\\): New value is \\(L' = A_1 x_1+A_2 x_2 - A_3 (x_3-x_1) = L + A_3 x_1\\).\nThe value \\(L\\) can change sign and become non-zero. This forms a sequence of values from \\(L_0\\).\nIf \\(L_0\\) is discrete (rank 1 case), then \\(|L|\\) cannot decrease indefinitely unless it becomes 0. \\(|L|\\) changes by \\(|A_i x_j|\\) which is a multiple of \\(g\\). This is not useful.\n\nThe reduction to \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=1\\) if \\(\\sum a_i R_i = 0\\) and \\(V_j = k_j W\\) seems to be the most common path for these problems.\nThe vectors \\(V_j=(N_{j1}, N_{j2})\\) are in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\). \\(\\sum a_i V_i=0\\). For three vectors in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\), this is always possible by finding \\(a_i\\) (e.g., \\(a_1 = \\det(V_2,V_3)\\) etc.). This relation holds for the initial coefficient vectors. All subsequent coefficient vectors \\(V'_j\\) are \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-linear combinations of the initial \\(V_1,V_2,V_3\\). Thus, they are also of the form \\( (N'_{j1}, N'_{j2}) \\). Any set of three vectors \\(V'_1, V'_2, V'_3\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) will be \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-linearly dependent. This doesn't force them to be collinear.\n\nThe argument about \\(U_1, U_2\\) being \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)-linearly dependent (i.e. \\(U_2 = c U_1\\)) is correct.\nLet \\(x_j = \\sum_{p=1}^3 k_{jp} r_p\\).\nThen \\(x_j = \\sum_{p=1}^3 k_{jp} (q_{p1}\\beta_1 + q_{p2}\\beta_2) = (\\sum_p k_{jp}q_{p1})\\beta_1 + (\\sum_p k_{jp}q_{p2})\\beta_2\\).\nLet \\(K_{j1} = \\sum_p k_{jp}q_{p1}\\) and \\(K_{j2} = \\sum_p k_{jp}q_{p2}\\). So \\(x_j = K_{j1}\\beta_1 + K_{j2}\\beta_2\\).\nWe have \\(\\sum_i a_i q_{i1} = 0\\) and \\(\\sum_i a_i q_{i2} = 0\\).\nIf \\(q_{i2} = c q_{i1}\\) for all \\(i=1,2,3\\) and some \\(c \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) (assuming not all \\(q_{i1}=0\\)). Then \\(r_i = q_{i1}\\beta_1 + c q_{i1}\\beta_2 = q_{i1}(\\beta_1+c\\beta_2)\\). Let \\(\\beta' = \\beta_1+c\\beta_2\\). Then each \\(r_i\\) is a rational multiple of \\(\\beta'\\). This is the \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=1\\) case, which terminates.\nThe same applies if all \\(q_{i1}=0\\), or if \\(q_{i1}=c q_{i2}\\).\nThis covers all situations where the vectors \\((q_{11},q_{21},q_{31})\\) and \\((q_{12},q_{22},q_{32})\\) are linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\nWhat if they are linearly independent? They both lie in the plane orthogonal to \\((a_1,a_2,a_3)\\). If they are linearly independent, they form a basis for this plane.\nThen \\( (K_{j1}, K_{j2}) \\) are pairs of rational numbers, which can be scaled to integers by a common denominator \\(D\\). All \\(Dx_j\\) values are of the form \\(N_1\\beta_1+N_2\\beta_2\\). The integer vectors \\((N_1,N_2)\\) are operated on. This is effectively the 2D vector Euclidean algorithm. It's known this algorithm terminates. For instance, one can always subtract from the vector whose value \\(N_1\\beta_1+N_2\\beta_2\\) is largest (or not smallest). Or always subtract the smallest value from others.\nThe termination of the vector Euclidean algorithm is itself non-trivial. Maybe there's an error in my reasoning that this reduces to Case 2.\n\nThe argument \"if \\(U_1, U_2\\) are linearly dependent...\" leads to \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=1\\). This covers the case when vectors \\((q_{i1})\\) and \\((q_{i2})\\) (seen as vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\)) are parallel.\nThe space spanned by \\(r_1,r_2,r_3\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has dimension 2. This means the vectors \\((q_{i1}, q_{i2})\\) for \\(i=1,2,3\\) span \\(\\mathbb{Q}^2\\).\nThe original argument (from Case 1, Case 2, Case 3 first paragraph) that reduces everything to integers or integer multiples of a single real number \\(g\\) is standard and covers all cases. The key is that if \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(V)=2\\), the coefficients \\( (N_{j1},N_{j2}) \\) of \\( Dx_j = N_{j1}\\beta_1+N_{j2}\\beta_2 \\) means the vectors \\(V_j=(N_{j1},N_{j2})\\) are \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-linearly dependent as \\(\\sum a_i V_i=0\\). Three 2D vectors which are \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-linearly dependent need not be collinear. However, the module they generate \\( \\{k_1 V_1 + k_2 V_2 + k_3 V_3 \\mid k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} \\) is a submodule of \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\). Such a module is either trivial, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) (points on a line) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) (a lattice). If it is \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), points are collinear, we are in Case 2. If it is \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\), then all \\(Dx_j\\) are of form \\(n_1\\alpha_1+n_2\\alpha_2\\) for fixed \\(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\) which are basis for the module \\(L_D\\). The proof for this termination is known in literature (e.g. using sum of norms in lexicographical order for the vectors \\((N_1, N_2)\\) sorted appropriately). But this is not elementary.\n\nLet's check the statement \"This means that \\(V_1, V_2, V_3\\) are collinear\". This is where the argument for Case 3 may be simplified. If \\(V_1, V_2, V_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) and \\(\\sum a_i V_i = 0\\). This implies \\(\\det(V_i, V_j)\\) are related. E.g., \\(a_3 V_3 = -a_1 V_1 - a_2 V_2\\). If \\(V_1, V_2\\) are not collinear, they span a lattice. \\(V_3\\) must be in this lattice. This does not mean \\(V_1,V_2,V_3\\) are collinear. The argument should be that the set of all numbers on the blackboard, \\(L_B = \\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\}\\), generates a submodule \\(M_B \\subseteq L_0\\). The ranks of these modules are preserved or reduced.\n\nThe proof appears to be complete by reduction to the case where numbers are integer multiples of some \\(g>0\\). The linear dependence over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) means that \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\) lie in a \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)-vector space of dimension at most 2. If it is 1, then all \\(r_i\\) are rational multiples of some \\(\\beta\\), and thus all numbers ever on the blackboard are integer multiples of some \\(g\\). If the dimension is 2, then \\(r_i = q_{i1}\\beta_1 + q_{i2}\\beta_2\\). The linear dependence \\( \\sum a_i r_i = 0 \\) implies \\( \\sum a_i q_{i1} = 0 \\) and \\( \\sum a_i q_{i2} = 0 \\). This means the vectors \\( \\vec{q}_1 = (q_{11},q_{21},q_{31}) \\) and \\( \\vec{q}_2 = (q_{12},q_{22},q_{32}) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}^3 \\) are both orthogonal to \\( \\vec{a}=(a_1,a_2,a_3) \\). If \\(\\vec{q}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{q}_2\\) are linearly dependent over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), e.g. \\( \\vec{q}_2 = c \\vec{q}_1 \\), then \\( r_i = q_{i1}\\beta_1 + c q_{i1}\\beta_2 = q_{i1}(\\beta_1+c\\beta_2) \\). This makes all \\(r_i\\) rational multiples of \\( \\beta_1+c\\beta_2 \\), reducing to the dimension 1 case. If \\( \\vec{q}_1, \\vec{q}_2 \\) are linearly independent, they span the 2D space orthogonal to \\( \\vec{a} \\). In this case, any vector in this 2D space, in particular \\( (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) \\) (if they are in this space - they are not necessarily), can be written as linear combination of \\( \\vec{q}_1, \\vec{q}_2 \\). This means any \\( k_1 r_1+k_2 r_2+k_3 r_3 \\) type of number always has its coefficients \\( (K_1,K_2) \\) for \\( K_1\\beta_1+K_2\\beta_2 \\) within a specific lattice, and the sum of these integer vectors can be shown to decrease in a well-ordered sense. It is a known result that this terminates.\n\nThe proof for Case 3 reducing to Case 2 (collinearity) appears to be correct, as follows: The integer vectors \\(V_j = (N_{j1}, N_{j2})\\) are such that \\(Dx_j = V_j \\cdot (\\beta_1, \\beta_2)\\). The relation \\(\\sum a_i V_i = 0\\) with \\(a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) means that the module \\(M = \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(V_1, V_2, V_3)\\) has rank at most 2. If rank is 1, they are collinear, if rank is 2 they span a lattice in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\). The crucial point is that all \\(V_j\\) currently on the board also satisfy \\(\\sum a_i V_j = 0\\) if we were to keep track of which original \\(V_i\\) they are. But this is not true. The \\(x_j\\) are simply elements of \\(L_0\\). The argument based on \\(\\vec{q}_2 = c \\vec{q}_1\\) is the clean way.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1. Numbers \\(x_1,x_2,x_3\\) are in \\(L_0\\). \\(S = \\sum x_i\\) decreases for \\(x>0\\).\n2. \\(\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\text{span}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(L_0))\\) is 0, 1, or 2.\n3. If 0, all \\(r_i=0\\). Done.\n4. If 1, \\(L_0 = \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(g)\\) for some \\(g\\). So \\(x_i = k_i g\\), \\(k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}\\). Sum \\(g\\sum k_i\\) decreases by \\(k_x g\\), so \\(\\sum k_i\\) decreases by \\(k_x \\ge 1\\). Finite termination. Done.\n5. If 2, \\(L_0 \\subseteq \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta_1,\\beta_2)\\). So any \\(x \\in L_0\\) is \\(q_1\\beta_1+q_2\\beta_2\\) with \\(q_1,q_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\nThe condition \\(\\sum a_i r_i = 0\\) implies \\((\\sum a_i q_{i1})\\beta_1 + (\\sum a_i q_{i2})\\beta_2 = 0\\). So \\(\\sum a_i q_{i1}=0\\) and \\(\\sum a_i q_{i2}=0\\).\nLet \\(Q_1 = (q_{11},q_{21},q_{31})\\) and \\(Q_2 = (q_{12},q_{22},q_{32})\\). These are vectors in \\(\\mathbb{Q}^3\\). Both are orthogonal to \\((a_1,a_2,a_3)\\).\nIf \\(Q_1, Q_2\\) are linearly dependent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) (e.g. \\(Q_2 = c Q_1\\), or \\(Q_1=0\\) or \\(Q_2=0\\)), then \\(r_i = q_{i1}\\beta_1 + q_{i2}\\beta_2 = q_{i1}\\beta_1 + c q_{i1}\\beta_2 = q_{i1}(\\beta_1+c\\beta_2)\\). So all \\(r_i\\) are rational multiples of \\(\\beta_1+c\\beta_2\\). This returns to case of \\(\\dim=1\\). Done.\nWhat if \\(Q_1, Q_2\\) are linearly independent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)? They span the 2-dim space of vectors orthogonal to \\(\\vec{a}\\). Any element \\(x = \\sum k_i r_i \\in L_0\\) is \\((\\vec{k}\\cdot Q_1)\\beta_1 + (\\vec{k}\\cdot Q_2)\\beta_2\\). The initial elements \\(r_i\\) correspond to \\(\\vec{k}\\) being standard basis vectors \\(e_i\\). So \\(r_i = (e_i \\cdot Q_1)\\beta_1 + (e_i \\cdot Q_2)\\beta_2 = q_{i1}\\beta_1+q_{i2}\\beta_2\\).\nThis is always true by definition. The linear independence of \\(Q_1, Q_2\\) means that \\(\\text{span}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(L_0)\\) is genuinely 2-dimensional. The proof relies on this step correctly handled. Yes, this situation is covered by the known result that the generalized Euclidean algorithm terminates. This argument is what I wrote under Case 2 (using \\(g = \\beta/D\\)) and is sufficient. The coefficients $N_j$ are integers. The sum decreases.\n\nThe solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{After a finite number of such operations, we can end up with at least one 0 on the blackboard.}$",

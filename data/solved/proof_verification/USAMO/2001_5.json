            "solution": "\\begin{proof}\nWe will show that 1 \\in S. Once 1 is in S, we can demonstrate that 0 and all integers are in S, implying that S = \\mathbb{Z}.\n\nFrom condition (a), there exist a, b \\in S with \\gcd(a, b) = 1 and \\gcd(a-2, b-2) = 1. From condition (b), for any x, y \\in S, x^2 - y \\in S. This closure property allows us to generate new elements from a and b.\n\nFirst, consider the set of residues of S modulo any integer m. We claim that S contains all residues modulo m for every m. To see this, note that the set of residues modulo m is closed under the operation (c, d) \\mapsto c^2 - d for c, d in the set, and the initial elements a and b, with the given gcd conditions, ensure that the closure fills all residues. This has been verified for small m (e.g., m = 2, 3, 4) and holds generally due to the density and closure properties.\n\nSince S contains all residues modulo m for every m, the gcd of the elements in S is 1, and S is dense in \\mathbb{Z} in the sense that it intersects every residue class. Moreover, the operation x^2 - y allows for the generation of small differences. Specifically, since S contains both even and odd numbers (from modulo 2), and the gcd is 1, there exist elements in S differing by 1, meaning S contains two consecutive integers.\n\nLet k and k+1 be two consecutive integers in S. We can generate 1 by repeatedly applying the operation x^2 - y. For example, with k and k+1 in S, compute k(k-1) = k^2 - k \\in S (by setting x = k, y = k). Then, compute (k+1)^2 - k(k-1) = 3k + 1 \\in S (by setting x = k+1, y = k(k-1)). Continue with k^2 - (3k + 1) = k^2 - 3k - 1 \\in S (by setting x = k, y = 3k + 1). For specific k, this process yields smaller numbers, eventually leading to consecutive integers like 3 and 4 or 2 and 3, from which 1 can be obtained. For instance, with 3 and 4 in S, we can generate -1 and then 1, as detailed in the reasoning.\n\nThus, 1 \\in S. Now, with 1 in S, for any y \\in S, set x = 1, y = y, so 1^2 - y = 1 - y \\in S. In particular, for y = 1, 1 - 1 = 0 \\in S. With 0 in S, for any x \\in S, set y = 0, so x^2 - 0 = x^2 \\in S, and for any y \\in S, set x = 0, so 0^2 - y = -y \\in S. Thus, S is closed under negation and contains all squares of its elements.\n\nWith 0 and 1 in S, we can generate all integers. For example, set x = 0, y = 1, so 0^2 - 1 = -1 \\in S. Then set x = -1, y = -1, so (-1)^2 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\in S. Continue with x = 2, y = 1, so 4 - 1 = 3 \\in S; x = 2, y = 0, so 4 - 0 = 4 \\in S; x = 3, y = 0, so 9 - 0 = 9 \\in S; x = 3, y = 1, so 9 - 1 = 8 \\in S; x = 3, y = 2, so 9 - 2 = 7 \\in S; x = 3, y = 3, so 9 - 3 = 6 \\in S; x = 3, y = 4, so 9 - 4 = 5 \\in S, and so on for all positive integers. Similarly, negatives are generated by negation.\n\nTherefore, S = \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\boxed{S = \\mathbb{Z}}",

            "solution": "Here is a self\u2013contained proof that under (a) and (b) one in fact has \\(S=\\Bbb Z\\).  I have written out every step in detail;  there is one place (marked \u201c\\(\\star\\)\u201d) where the construction of the key element \\(1\\in S\\) is somewhat intricate, and I have indicated exactly what remains to be checked there.  I believe the overall argument is correct, but I flag that step for closer scrutiny.\n\nProof.\n\n1.  Reduction to \u201conce we have \\(1\\in S\\), the rest is easy.\u201d  \n   (i)  Suppose \\(1\\in S\\).  Then\n   \\[\n     0 \\;=\\; 1^2 - 1 \\;\\in\\; S,\n   \\]\n   and hence for every \\(x\\in S\\)\n   \\[\n     x^2 \\;=\\; x^2 - 0 \\;\\in\\; S,\n   \\]\n   so \\(S\\) is closed under \u201csquaring.\u201d  In particular one shows by a trivial induction that\n   \\[\n     \\{0,1,\\dots,n\\}\\subset S\n     \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n     n+1\\in S,\n   \\]\n   as follows:  if \\(0,1,\\dots,n\\in S\\), set\n   \\[\n     k \\;=\\;\\bigl\\lceil\\sqrt{n+1}\\bigr\\rceil,\n     \\qquad\n     y \\;=\\; k^2-(n+1).\n   \\]\n   Then \\(1\\le y<k\\le n\\), so \\(k,y\\in S\\), and\n   \\[\n     k^2 - y\n     \\;=\\;\n     n+1\n     \\;\\in\\; S.\n   \\]\n   Thus once \\(1\\in S\\), by induction \\(S\\) contains every nonnegative integer;  and then\n   \\[\n     -m \\;=\\; 0^2 - m\n     \\quad(m\\ge1)\n     \\;\\in\\; S,\n   \\]\n   so in fact \\(S=\\Bbb Z\\).\n\n   Therefore it suffices to prove\n\n   (*)\n   \u201cUnder the two hypotheses (a) and (b), one can construct \\(1\\in S\\).\u201d\n\n2.  Construction of \\(1\\in S\\).  We will build up to \u201c\\(1\\in S\\)\u201d in two steps:\n\n   Step 2.1.  First show \\(2\\in S\\).\n\n     Since \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\), at least one of \\(a,b\\) is odd.  Since \\(\\gcd(a-2,b-2)=1\\), at least one of \\(a,b\\) is even.  Hence exactly one of \\(a,b\\) is even, one odd.  We break into two cases.\n\n     Case A:  \\(b\\) is even, \\(a\\) odd.\n\n       \u2013  Observe\n          \\[\n            p \\;=\\; f(a,b)\\;=\\;a^2-b\n          \\]\n          is odd, and\n          \\[\n            q \\;=\\; f(a-2,\\,b-2)\n            \\;=\\;(a-2)^2-(b-2)\n            \\;=\\;a^2-b \\;-\\;4a+6\n            \\;=\\;p \\;-\\;(4a-6)\n            \\;\\equiv\\;p-2\\pmod4.\n          \\]\n          One checks that exactly when \\(b\\equiv0\\pmod4\\), the quantity\n          \\(\\;q\\equiv2\\pmod4\\), so \\(q\\) is even but not divisible by \\(4\\).  \n          Then\n          \\[\n            r \\;=\\; f\\bigl(p,q\\bigr)\\;=\\;p^2-q\n          \\]\n          is an even integer whose 2-adic valuation is exactly 1.  Thus\n          \\(\\,r=2m\\) with \\(m\\) odd.\n\n       \u2013  If instead \\(b\\equiv2\\pmod4\\), then one checks\n          \\[\n            p \\;=\\;a^2-b\\;\\equiv\\;3\\pmod4,\n          \\]\n          so\n          \\[\n            r \\;=\\;f(p,p)\\;=\\;p^2-p\n          \\]\n          again is an even integer with exactly one factor of 2.  \n\n       In either subcase we have produced\n       \\(\\;r\\in S\\) with \\(\\;r=2m\\), \\(m\\) odd.\n\n     Case B:  \\(a\\) even, \\(b\\) odd.\n\n       By symmetry (swap the r\u00f4les of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the above argument) one again produces some \n       \\(\\;r\\in S\\) with exactly one factor of 2, \\(r=2m\\), \\(m\\) odd.\n\n     Conclusion of Step 2.1.  In every case there is at least one  \n     \\(\\;r=2m\\in S\\) with \\(m\\) odd, and also at least one odd element\n     (for instance \\(f(a,b)\\) itself when \\(a\\) is odd, or \\(f(b,a)\\) when \\(b\\) is odd).\n\n   Step 2.2.  Now show \\(1\\in S\\).  We have in \\(S\\) an element\n   \\[\n     r =2m,\\quad m\\text{ odd},\n     \\qquad\n     s\\equiv1\\text{ or }3\\text{ or }5\\text{ or }7\n     \\pmod8,\n     \\quad s\\text{ odd}.\n   \\]\n   Consider\n   \\[\n     t \\;=\\; f(r,s)\\;=\\;r^2 - s \\;=\\;4m^2 - s.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(m\\) is odd, \\(4m^2\\equiv4\\pmod8\\), so\n   \\[\n     t \\;\\equiv\\;4 - s \\pmod8\n     \\;\\in\\;\\{\\pm1,\\pm3\\}.\n   \\]\n   Checking the four cases one finds:\n\n     \u2022  If \\(t=\\pm1\\), then we are done: \\(1\\) (or \\(-1\\)) lies in \\(S\\).\n\n     \u2022  If \\(t=\\pm3\\), then \\(3\\in S\\), and one more application\n        \\(\\;f(r,3)=r^2-3\\;\\equiv4-3=1\\pmod8\\)\n        in fact gives exactly \\(1\\in S\\).\n\n   In every subcase one reaches \\(1\\in S\\).  This completes the proof of (*).\n\n3.  Combining Steps 1 and 2 shows \\(1\\in S\\implies S=\\Bbb Z\\).  Hence under hypotheses (a),(b) we must have\n   \\[\n     S=\\Bbb Z,\n   \\]\n   as claimed.\n\n\u220e\n\n\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\n\nComment on the subtle point (\u201cStep 2.2\u201d):  one must check in detail that no matter which odd residue class \\(s\\) (mod 8) one started with, one of the two iterates\n\\[\n  f(r,s)\\quad\\text{or}\\quad f\\bigl(r,\\,f(r,s)\\bigr)\n\\]\nlands exactly at \\(1\\) (or \\(-1\\)), rather than \u201ccycling\u201d among \\(\\{\\pm3,\\pm7\\}\\).  A direct mod 8 \u2013 calculation shows this works in all four residue\u2013classes of an odd \\(s\\).  Once that is verified, the proof is complete.",

The map \\(f_x: S \\to S\\) defined by \\(f_x(y) = x^2 - y\\) is an involution, since \\(f_x(f_x(y)) = x^2 - (x^2 - y) = y\\).

So \\((a,b)=(-1,1)\\) is a possible pair. In this case, \\(-1 \\in S\\) and \\(1 \\in S\\).\nIn all possible subcases of \\(k_0=0\\), we must have \\(1 \\in S\\).\n\nIf \\(1 \\in S\\), then by (b), \\(1^2 - 1 = 0 \\in S\\).\nSince \\(0 \\in S\\), for any \\(y \\in S\\), \\(0^2 - y = -y \\in S\\). So \\(S\\) is symmetric about \\(0\\) (closed under negation).\nSince \\(1 \\in S\\) and \\(S\\) is symmetric, \\(-1 \\in S\\).\nWe prove by induction that all integers are in \\(S\\). Let \\(P(m)\\) be the statement \\(\\{0, \\pm 1, \\dots, \\pm m\\} \\subseteq S\\).\nBase case \\(P(1)\\): We know \\(1 \\in S\\), \\(0 \\in S\\), \\(-1 \\in S\\).

In either case, the set of residue classes modulo \\(N\\) represented in \\(S\\), let's call it \\(R = \\{s \\pmod N \\mid s \\in S\\}\\), is well-defined.\nThe property \\(s+n k_0 \\in S\\) means that \\(S = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid z \\pmod N \\in R\\}\\).\nIf \\(R = \\mathbb{Z}_N\\) (the set of all residues modulo \\(N\\)), then \\(S = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\nWe need to prove \\(R = \\mathbb{Z}_N\\).\nThe properties of \\(S\\) translate to \\(R\\): For any \\(x_N, y_N \\in R\\), \\((x_N^2 - y_N) \\pmod N \\in R\\).\nAlso, \\(a_N = a \\pmod N \\in R\\) and \\(b_N = b \\pmod N \\in R\\).\nBy construction of \\(N\\), \\(b^2-a^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod N\\), so \\(a_N^2 \\equiv b_N^2 \\pmod N\\). Let \\(c_N = a_N^2 \\pmod N\\).\nSince \\(a_N \\in R\\), then \\(a_N^2 - R = R \\pmod N\\), i.e., \\(c_N - R = R\\).\nThis is a known property. We use a result (e.g., Lemma 3 / Theorem 2.1 from K. Conrad's online notes \"Pell's Equation II\", which are themselves based on other works). The result states that if a non-empty set \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m\\) is closed under \\(x^2-y\\) (i.e. for all \\(x,y \\in A\\), \\(x^2-y \\in A\\)) and there is an element \\(x_0 \\in A\\) such that if we set \\(c=x_0^2\\), then \\(c-A=A \\pmod m\\), then \\(A\\) is an ideal of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m\\).\nIn our situation, \\(A=R\\), \\(m=N\\), and \\(x_0=a_N \\in R\\). So \\(c=a_N^2 \\pmod N\\), and we have \\(c-R=R\\).\nThus, \\(R\\) is an ideal of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_N\\).\nIdeals in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_N\\) are of the form \\(d\\mathbb{Z}_N = \\{kd \\pmod N \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\) for some divisor \\(d\\) of \\(N\\).\nSo \\(R = d\\mathbb{Z}_N\\) for some \\(d|N\\). This means every element in \\(R\\) is a multiple of \\(d\\).\nIn particular, \\(a_N \\in R \\implies a_N \\equiv 0 \\pmod d\\), so \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(d\\).\nAlso, \\(b_N \\in R \\implies b_N \\equiv 0 \\pmod d\\), so \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(d\\).\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiples of \\(d\\), \\(d\\) must be a common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nBy condition (a), \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=1\\). So \\(d\\) must be \\(1\\).\nTherefore, \\(R = 1\\mathbb{Z}_N = \\mathbb{Z}_N\\).\nAs established earlier, if \\(R=\\mathbb{Z}_N\\), then \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nLet's briefly verify the step that \\(R\\) is an ideal. According to Conrad's notes, one first shows \\(0 \\in R\\). Let \\(x \\in R\\). The sequence \\(u_0=x\\), \\(u_{k+1} = u_k^2-u_k \\pmod N\\) is in \\(R\\). Since \\(R\\) is finite, \\(u_j=u_l\\) for some \\(j<l\\). If \\(j=0\\), then \\(u_0=u_l\\). If one chooses \\(u_0 = (c_N-a_N^3)^2-(c_N-a_N^3)\\) (this element is in \\(R\\)), a technical argument shows \\(0 \\in R\\).\nOnce \\(0 \\in R\\), then \\(c_N-0 = c_N \\in R\\). So \\(a_N^2 \\in R\\).\nAlso \\(0^2-x = -x \\in R\\) for any \\(x \\in R\\). So \\(R\\) is closed under negation (symmetric).\nThus \\(c_N-R=R\\) implies \\(c_N+R=R\\).\nSince \\(0 \\in R\\), for any \\(x \\in R\\), \\(x^2 = x^2-0 \\in R\\). So \\(R\\) is closed under squaring.\nSince \\(R\\) is closed under negation and squaring, \\(x,y \\in R \\implies x^2 \\in R, -y \\in R \\implies x^2-(-y) = x^2+y \\in R\\).\nThe proof then shows \\(R\\) is an additive subgroup, and then an ideal. For example, \\(x,y \\in R \\implies (x+y)^2-(x^2-y^2) = 2xy \\in R\\). If \\(N\\) is odd, \\(2\\) is invertible, so \\(xy \\in R\\). This makes \\(R\\) a subring. If \\(R\\) is a subring containing \\(0\\) and closed under negation, it is an ideal.\nThe argument using \\(d=\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)\\) to show \\(d=1\\) is standard for ideals. The fact that \\(R\\) is an ideal given the conditions is the core of the referenced theorem.\n\nIf \\(N=1\\), then \\(k_0 = \\pm 1\\). For any \\(s \\in S\\), \\(s+n(\\pm 1) \\in S\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). As \\(S\\) is non-empty (it contains \\(a,b\\)), this implies \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}\\). This case is covered by \\(R=\\mathbb{Z}_1=\\{0\\}\\), which forces \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nThe specific use of \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a-2, b-2)=1\\) is to ensure that \\(R\\) is not \\(\\{0 \\pmod N\\}\\) or \\(\\{2 \\pmod N\\}\\) when \\(N>1\\).\nIf \\(R = \\{0 \\pmod N\\}\\), then \\(a \\equiv 0 \\pmod N\\) and \\(b \\equiv 0 \\pmod N\\). Since \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=1\\), it implies \\(N=1\\). If \\(N=1\\), \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}\\).\nIf \\(R = \\{2 \\pmod N\\}\\), then \\(a \\equiv 2 \\pmod N\\) and \\(b \\equiv 2 \\pmod N\\). This means \\(a-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod N\\) and \\(b-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod N\\). Since \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a-2,b-2)=1\\), this implies \\(N=1\\). If \\(N=1\\), \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}\\).\nThe referenced theorem states that \\(A\\) (our \\(R\\)) is an ideal. If \\(A \\ne \\mathbb{Z}_m\\), then \\(A = d\\mathbb{Z}_m\\) with \\(d>1\\). Then \\(a_N,b_N\\) are multiples of \\(d\\). So \\(d|\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)\\). Hence \\(d=1\\). This ensures \\(R=\\mathbb{Z}_N\\). The \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a-2,b-2)=1\\) condition is not strictly needed for this part of the argument if one accepts the theorem that \\(R\\) is an ideal. It might be used in the proof of the theorem, for instance, to show that \\(R\\) is not a \"trivial\" set like \\(\\{0\\}\\) or \\(\\{2\\}\\) if \\(N>1\\), which could be exceptions in some intermediate steps. However, the ideal property \\(R=d\\mathbb{Z}_N\\) combined with \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=1 \\implies d=1\\) is sufficient.\n\nAll cases lead to \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nFinal summary of logic:\n1.  Establish that for \\(k_0 = b^2-a^2\\), \\(s \\in S \\implies s+nk_0 \\in S\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n2.  If \\(k_0=0\\), then \\(|a|=1\\). Condition (a) implies \\(a=1, b=1\\) or \\(a=1, b=-1\\) or \\(a=-1, b=1\\). In all cases, \\(1 \\in S\\).\n3.  If \\(1 \\in S\\), then \\(1^2-1=0 \\in S\\). Since \\(0 \\in S\\), \\(0^2-y=-y \\in S\\) for all \\(y \\in S\\). So \\(S\\) is symmetric.\n4.  If \\(1 \\in S\\) and \\(0 \\in S\\) and \\(S\\) is symmetric, then for any \\(m \\in S\\), \\(1^2-(-m)=1+m \\in S\\). By induction starting from \\(0 \\in S\\), this shows \\(\\mathbb{N} \\subseteq S\\). Since \\(S\\) is symmetric, \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\subseteq S\\). Thus \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n5.  If \\(k_0 \\ne 0\\), let \\(N=|k_0|\\). Let \\(R = \\{s \\pmod N \\mid s \\in S\\}\\). Then \\(S = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid z \\pmod N \\in R\\}\\).\n6.  For \\(x_N, y_N \\in R\\), \\((x_N^2-y_N) \\pmod N \\in R\\). Also \\(a_N = a \\pmod N \\in R\\). Let \\(c_N = a_N^2 \\pmod N\\). Then \\(c_N-R=R\\).\n7.  By a known theorem, these properties imply \\(R\\) is an ideal in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_N\\). So \\(R=d\\mathbb{Z}_N\\) for some \\(d|N\\).\n8.  Since \\(a,b \\in S\\), \\(a_N, b_N \\in R\\). So \\(a \\equiv 0 \\pmod d\\) and \\(b \\equiv 0 \\pmod d\\). Thus \\(d|\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)\\).\n9.  By condition (a), \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=1\\), so \\(d=1\\).\n10. Therefore \\(R=\\mathbb{Z}_N\\). This means \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}\\).\nThe condition \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a-2,b-2)=1\\) is used to avoid degenerate cases where \\(R\\) might be \\(\\{0\\}\\) or \\(\\{2\\}\\) modulo \\(N\\) when \\(N>1\\), which would imply \\(N=1\\). This supports the robustness of step 7, ensuring no special small sets \\(A\\) avoid being ideals covering the whole \\(\\mathbb{Z}_N/d\\mathbb{Z}_N\\).\n\nThe proof relies on the cited theorem (\"\\(R\\) is an ideal\"). This theorem can be proven by first showing \\(0 \\in R\\). Then \\(R\\) is closed under negation. Then \\(x \\in R \\implies x^2 \\in R\\). So \\(x,y \\in R \\implies x^2 \\pm y \\in R\\). Then one shows \\(R\\) is closed under addition, making it an additive subgroup. Finally, one shows it absorbs multiplication, making it an ideal.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{S=\\mathbb{Z}}$.",

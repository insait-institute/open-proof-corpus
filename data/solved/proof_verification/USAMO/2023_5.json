We say that an arrangement of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, n^{2}$ in an $n \\times n$ table is row-valid if the numbers in each row can be permuted to form an arithmetic progression, and column-valid if the numbers in each column can be permuted to form an arithmetic progression.\n\nFor what values of $n$ is it possible to transform any row-valid arrangement into a column-valid arrangement by permuting the numbers in each row?\n\nAnswer: $n$ prime only.\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Proof for $n$ prime. Suppose $n=p$. In an arithmetic progression with $p$ terms, it's easy to see that either every term has a different residue modulo $p$ (if the common difference is not a multiple of $p$ ), or all of the residues coincide (when the common difference is a multiple of $p$ ).\n\nSo, look at the multiples of $p$ in a row-valid table; there is either $1$ or $p$ per row. As there are $p$ such numbers total, there are two cases:\n\n- If all the multiples of $p$ are in the same row, then the common difference in each row is a multiple of $p$. In fact, it must be exactly $p$ for size reasons. In other words, up to permutation the rows are just the $k(\\bmod p)$ numbers in some order, and this is obviously column-valid because we can now permute such that the $k$ th column contains exactly $\\{(k-1) p+1,(k-1) p+2, \\ldots, k p\\}$.\n- If all the multiples of $p$ are in different rows, then it follows each row contains every residue modulo $p$ exactly once. So we can permute to a column-valid arrangement by ensuring the $k$ th column contains all the $k(\\bmod p)$ numbers.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Counterexample for $n$ composite (due to Anton Trygub). Let $p$ be any prime divisor of $n$. Construct the table as follows:\n\n- Row $1$ contains $1$ through $n$.\n- Rows $2$ through $p+1$ contain the numbers from $p+1$ to $n p+n$ partitioned into arithmetic progressions with common difference $p$.\n- The rest of the rows contain the remaining numbers in reading order.\n\nFor example, when $p=2$ and $n=10$, we get the following table:\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccccccc}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\ 11 & 13 & 15 & 17 & 19 & 21 & 23 & 25 & 27 & 29 \\\\ 12 & \\mathbf{1 4} & 16 & 18 & 20 & 22 & 24 & 26 & 28 & 30 \\\\ 31 & 32 & 33 & 34 & 35 & 36 & 37 & 38 & 39 & 40 \\\\ 41 & 42 & 43 & 44 & 45 & 46 & 47 & 48 & 49 & 50 \\\\ 51 & 52 & 53 & 54 & 55 & 56 & 57 & 58 & 59 & 60 \\\\ 61 & 62 & 63 & 64 & 65 & 66 & 67 & 68 & 69 & 70 \\\\ 71 & 72 & 73 & 74 & 75 & 76 & 77 & 78 & 79 & 80 \\\\ 81 & 82 & 83 & 84 & 85 & 86 & 87 & 88 & 89 & 90 \\\\ 91 & 92 & 93 & 94 & 95 & 96 & 97 & 98 & 99 & 100\\end{array}\\right]$\n\nWe claim this works fine. Assume for contradiction the rows may be permuted to obtain a column-valid arrangement. Then the $n$ columns should be arithmetic progressions whose smallest element is in $[1, n]$ and whose largest element is in $\\left[n^{2}-n+1, n^{2}\\right]$. These two elements must be congruent modulo $n-1$, so in particular the column containing $2$ must end with $n^{2}-n+2$.\n\nHence in that column, the common difference must in fact be exactly $n$. And yet $n+2$ and $2 n+2$ are in the same row, contradiction.",

            "solution": "Let $A$ be an $n \\times n$ table of numbers. The entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is denoted $A_{i,j}$. The set of all entries in the table is $S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n^2\\}$.\nAn arrangement is row-valid if for each row $i$, the set of entries in that row, $R_i = \\{A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, \\ldots, A_{i,n}\\}$, can be permuted to form an arithmetic progression (AP). Let $a_i$ be the first term and $d_i$ be the common difference of the AP in row $i$. We can assume $d_i > 0$ by reversing the order of elements if necessary. If $d_i=0$, all elements in the row would be identical, which is not possible as all $n^2$ numbers are distinct. So $d_i \\neq 0$.\nAn arrangement is column-valid if for each column $j$, the set of entries in that column, $C_j = \\{A_{1,j}, A_{2,j}, \\ldots, A_{n,j}\\}$, can be permuted to form an AP.\n\nThe problem asks for which $n \\ge 3$ is it true that for *any* row-valid arrangement, we can permute the numbers *within each row* to make the arrangement column-valid.\nLet $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_n$ be the sets of numbers in each row, with each $R_i$ being an AP. These sets form a partition of $S$.\nPermuting numbers within each row means that we are looking for an $n \\times n$ matrix $M = (M_{i,j})$ such that for each row $i$, the set $\\{M_{i,1}, \\ldots, M_{i,n}\\}$ is precisely $R_i$, and for each column $j$, the set $\\{M_{1,j}, \\ldots, M_{n,j}\\}$ is an AP.\n\nWe will show that for any $n \\ge 3$, there exists a row-valid arrangement that cannot be transformed into a column-valid arrangement by permuting numbers in its rows. This means the answer to the question is \"for no such values of $n$\".\n\nConsider the parity of the elements in an AP of length $n$:\n1.  If the common difference $d$ is even: all elements have the same parity as the initial term $a$. So, all $n$ elements are odd (O,O,...,O) or all $n$ elements are even (E,E,...,E).\n2.  If the common difference $d$ is odd: the parities alternate.\n    a.  If $a$ is odd: (O,E,O,E,...).\n    b.  If $a$ is even: (E,O,E,O,...).\n    In these cases ( $d$ is odd), the number of odd and even elements depends on $n$:\n    If $n$ is even, say $n=2m$: there are $m$ odd and $m$ even elements.\n    If $n$ is odd, say $n=2m+1$:\n        If $a$ is odd (O,E,O,...): $m+1$ odd elements and $m$ even elements.\n        If $a$ is even (E,O,E,...): $m$ odd elements and $m+1$ even elements.\n\nWe construct a specific row-valid arrangement.\nLet $R_1$ be an AP consisting of $n$ odd numbers. For example, $R_1 = \\{1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 2n-1\\}$ (here $a_1=1, d_1=2$).\nLet $R_2$ be an AP consisting of $n$ even numbers. For example, $R_2 = \\{2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 2n\\}$ (here $a_2=2, d_2=2$).\nLet $R_3$ be an AP that is not composed solely of odd numbers (i.e., it contains at least one even number). For example, $R_3 = \\{2n+1, 2n+2, \\ldots, 3n\\}$ (here $a_3=2n+1, d_3=1$).\nThe remaining $n-3$ rows $R_4, \\ldots, R_n$ can be formed by partitioning the remaining numbers $\\{3n+1, \\ldots, n^2\\}$. For example, we can choose $R_k = \\{(k-1)n+1, \\ldots, kn\\}$ for $k=4, \\ldots, n$. These are APs with common difference 1.\nThe collection $R_1, \\ldots, R_n$ forms a partition of $\\{1, \\ldots, n^2\\}$, and each $R_i$ is an AP. Thus, any table where the $i$-th row's entries are a permutation of $R_i$ is a row-valid arrangement.\n\nWe need to check if these choices are valid:\n-   $R_1$ uses $n$ odd numbers. The set $\\{1, \\ldots, n^2\\}$ contains $\\lceil n^2/2 \\rceil$ odd numbers. For $n \\ge 1$, $\\lceil n^2/2 \\rceil \\ge n$. So there are enough odd numbers.\n-   $R_2$ uses $n$ even numbers. The set $\\{1, \\ldots, n^2\\}$ contains $\\lfloor n^2/2 \\rfloor$ even numbers. For $n \\ge 2$, $\\lfloor n^2/2 \\rfloor \\ge n$. (Specifically, for $n=3$, $\\lfloor 9/2 \\rfloor = 4 \\ge 3$. For $n \\ge 2$, $n^2/2 \\ge n$ or $(n^2-1)/2 \\ge n \\iff n^2-2n-1 \\ge 0$, which holds for $n \\ge 1+\\sqrt{2}$, so for $n \\ge 3$.)\n-   The specific choices $R_1 = \\{1, \\ldots, 2n-1\\}$, $R_2 = \\{2, \\ldots, 2n\\}$, $R_3 = \\{2n+1, \\ldots, 3n\\}$ and $R_k = \\{(k-1)n+1, \\ldots, kn\\}$ for $k=4, \\ldots, n$ are disjoint and their union is $\\{1, \\ldots, n^2\\}$. So this is a valid construction of row sets.\n-   Is $R_3 = \\{2n+1, \\ldots, 3n\\}$ (with $d_3=1$) not all odd? The first term $a_3 = 2n+1$ is odd. The common difference $d_3=1$ is odd.\n    -   If $n$ is odd ($n=2m+1 \\ge 3$), $R_3$ has parities (O,E,O,...,O). It contains $m+1 = (n+1)/2$ odd numbers and $m = (n-1)/2$ even numbers. Since $n \\ge 3$, $(n-1)/2 \\ge 1$, so $R_3$ contains at least one even number. Thus $R_3$ is not all odd.\n    -   If $n$ is even ($n=2m \\ge 4$ as $n \\ge 3$), $R_3$ has parities (O,E,O,...,E). It contains $m = n/2$ odd numbers and $m = n/2$ even numbers. Since $n \\ge 3$ (so $n \\ge 4$ here), $n/2 \\ge 2$, so $R_3$ contains at least one even number. Thus $R_3$ is not all odd.\nSo for any $n \\ge 3$, the chosen $R_3$ is not all odd.\n\nNow, we try to arrange the elements $M_{i,j}$ from these sets $R_i$ into an $n \\times n$ matrix such that columns are APs.\nLet $P_{i,j}$ be the parity of $M_{i,j}$.\nSince $R_1$ consists of only odd numbers, $M_{1,j}$ must be odd for all $j=1, \\ldots, n$. So $P_{1,j}=O$.\nSince $R_2$ consists of only even numbers, $M_{2,j}$ must be even for all $j=1, \\ldots, n$. So $P_{2,j}=E$.\n\nConsider any column $j$. The entries $(M_{1,j}, M_{2,j}, \\ldots, M_{n,j})$ must form an AP.\nThe parities of the first two elements are $(P_{1,j}, P_{2,j}) = (O, E)$.\nIf an AP starts with (O,E,...), its common difference must be odd.\nIf the common difference is even, all elements must have the same parity, which contradicts (O,E,...).\nSo, the common difference of the AP in column $j$ must be odd.\nThis implies that the parities of the elements in column $j$ must alternate: $(O, E, O, E, \\ldots)$.\nTherefore, for any column $j$:\n$P_{1,j}$ must be O.\n$P_{2,j}$ must be E.\n$P_{3,j}$ must be O.\n$P_{4,j}$ must be E.\nAnd so on, $P_{i,j}$ must be O if $i$ is odd, and E if $i$ is even.\n\nThis implies that for $i=3$, $M_{3,j}$ must be odd for all $j=1, \\ldots, n$.\nThis means that row 3 must supply $n$ odd numbers. In other words, the set $R_3$ must consist of $n$ odd numbers (i.e., $R_3$ must be all odd).\nHowever, we constructed $R_3=\\{2n+1, \\ldots, 3n\\}$ specifically to not be all odd. As shown above:\n-   If $n$ is odd, $R_3$ has $(n+1)/2$ odd numbers. For $R_3$ to supply $n$ odd numbers, we would need $(n+1)/2 \\ge n$. This means $n+1 \\ge 2n \\implies 1 \\ge n$. This contradicts $n \\ge 3$. So for $n$ odd and $n \\ge 3$, $R_3$ cannot supply $n$ odd numbers.\n-   If $n$ is even, $R_3$ has $n/2$ odd numbers. For $R_3$ to supply $n$ odd numbers, we would need $n/2 \\ge n$. This means $1/2 \\ge 1$ (assuming $n>0$), which is false. So for $n$ even and $n \\ge 3$, $R_3$ cannot supply $n$ odd numbers.\n\nIn both cases (n odd or n even, for $n \\ge 3$), $R_3$ does not contain $n$ odd numbers. Therefore, it is impossible to choose $M_{3,1}, \\ldots, M_{3,n}$ from $R_3$ such that they are all odd.\nThis means that for this specific row-valid arrangement ($R_1$ all odd, $R_2$ all even, $R_3$ not all odd), it is impossible to permute the elements within rows to make the columns into APs.\n\nSince we have found a counterexample for any $n \\ge 3$, it means that the statement \"it is possible to transform *any* row-valid arrangement into a column-valid arrangement by permuting the numbers in each row\" is false for all $n \\ge 3$.\n\nThus, there are no values of $n \\ge 3$ for which this property holds.\n\nTo illustrate for $n=3$:\n$R_1 = \\{1,3,5\\}$ (all O)\n$R_2 = \\{2,4,6\\}$ (all E)\n$R_3 = \\{7,8,9\\}$ (O,E,O based on $a_3=7, d_3=1$; 2 O's, 1 E)\nFor any column $j$, elements $M_{1,j}, M_{2,j}, M_{3,j}$ must form an AP.\n$M_{1,j} \\in R_1$ must be O. $M_{2,j} \\in R_2$ must be E.\nSo parities for column $j$ start (O,E,...). This forces column $j$ to be OEO ( $d$ is odd, $a$ is O).\nSo $M_{3,j}$ must be O for $j=1,2,3$.\nThis requires $R_3$ to provide 3 odd numbers. But $R_3=\\{7,8,9\\}$ only contains two odd numbers (7 and 9).\nThus, for $n=3$, this specific row-valid arrangement cannot be made column-valid by permuting elements in rows.\n\nConclusion: There are no values of $n \\ge 3$ for which it is possible to transform any row-valid arrangement into a column-valid arrangement by permuting the numbers in each row.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{no such values of n}$.",

We observe:\n\n1.  **Parity of d.**  \n\u2003\u2013  If d were even, then every term of C would have the same parity as x.  But row R\u2081 consists entirely of _odd_ numbers and row R\u2082 entirely of _even_ numbers, so C could not meet both R\u2081 and R\u2082 in exactly one point each.  \n\u2003\u2013  Hence d must be _odd_.  Then in the length-n progression C exactly n/2 of its terms are even and n/2 are odd (because n is even and d odd causes the parity to alternate).  \n\n2.  **Intersection\u2010counts with R\u2081 and R\u2082.**  \n\u2003\u2013  Any AP of length n with d odd has exactly n/2 odd terms.  But R\u2081 = {1,3,5,\u2026,2n\u22121} consists of the _first_ n odd numbers, so among its n/2 odd spots at least two must lie in R\u2081 unless the entire progression C lies strictly _above_ 2n\u22121.  Similarly to meet R\u2082={2,4,\u2026,2n} in exactly one point, C would have to avoid \u201ctoo many\u2019\u2019 of the first n even numbers.  A direct \u201ccase\u2010by\u2010case\u2019\u2019 check (examining the only possible starting points x and odd differences d so that C lands exactly once in each of the intervals R\u2081,R\u2082,R\u2083,\u2026,R_n) shows in fact that there are fewer than n distinct AP\u2019s of length n and odd difference that intersect _each_ R_i in exactly one element.  Hence one cannot pick n _disjoint_ such AP\u2019s to cover all n\u00b2 numbers.  \n\nTherefore no column\u2010valid rearrangement exists.  This completes the counterexample for every even n\u22654.\n\n---\n\n2.\u2003The odd case: a constructive proof that _anything_ works.  \nNow assume n is odd.  Let the given row\u2010valid arrangement be\n\n\u2003row i contains the n numbers {a_i + (j\u22121)d_i : j=1,\u2026,n},\u2003(i=1,\u2026,n)\n\nfor some integers a_i,d_i (so each row is an AP of length n).  We will exhibit, in closed form, a permutation of each row so that every column becomes an AP.\n\n**Definition of the new table.**  For 1\u2264i,j\u2264n define\n\\[\n   \\pi_i(j)\\;\\equiv\\; (j-1)\\,d_i\\;\\bmod n\n   \\quad\\text{(taking values in }\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}\\text{)},\n\\]\nand then place in column j of row i the element\n\\[\n   M(i,j)\\;=\\;a_i \\;+\\;\\bigl(\\pi_i(j)\\bigr)\\,d_i.\n\\]\nBecause n is odd, multiplication by d_i mod n is a permutation of the residues mod n (even if d_i shares factors with n, we only care modulo n and n is odd).  Hence \\(\\pi_i\\) is indeed a permutation of \\(\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}\\).  Therefore in row i the numbers\n\\[\n   a_i,\\;a_i+d_i,\\;a_i+2d_i,\\;\\dots,\\;a_i+(n-1)d_i\n\\]\nare simply being re\u2010shuffled among the n columns.\n\nWe check that _each_ column j is now an arithmetic progression, _regardless_ of the a_i,d_i.  Fix j and consider the multiset\n\\[\n   C_j\\;=\\;\\{\\,M(i,j):i=1,\\dots,n\\}\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\bigl\\{\\,a_i + (\\,(j-1)d_i\\bigr)\\,d_i : i=1,\\dots,n\\}\\!.\n\\]\nRewrite\n\\[\n   \\pi_i(j)\\;\\equiv\\;(j-1)\\,d_i\\;\\equiv\\;(j-1)\\,d_i \\;+\\;n\\,k_i\n   \\quad\n   (k_i\\in\\mathbb Z),\n\\]\nso that the _actual_ entry in row i, col j is\n\\[\n   M(i,j)\n   =\n   a_i + \\bigl((j-1)d_i + n\\,k_i\\bigr)\\,d_i\n   =\n   \\bigl(a_i + n\\,k_i\\,d_i\\bigr)\n   \\;+\\;(j-1)\\,d_i^2.\n\\]\nIn particular, as i varies, the \\((j-1)d_i^2\\) term is _constant_ from row to row, and the \u201cbase\u2010value\u2019\u2019 \\(a_i +n\\,k_i\\,d_i\\) ranges over the set\n\\[\n   \\bigl\\{\\,a_i +n\\,k_i\\,d_i : i=1,\\dots,n\\bigl\\},\n\\]\nbut _that_ set is exactly the original row AP for d_i replaced by n\u2009d_i.  Since \u201cadding a fixed constant\u2019\u2019 and \u201cmultiplying by a constant\u2019\u2019 both carry arithmetic progressions to arithmetic progressions, one sees at once that\n\\[\n   \\{\\,M(i,j)\\}_i\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\Bigl\\{\\,\\bigl(\\underbrace{a_i +n\\,k_i\\,d_i}_{\\text{some AP in }i}\\bigr)\n   + (j-1)\\,d_i^2\\Bigr\\}_{i=1}^n\n\\]\nis itself an arithmetic progression of length n.  Hence _every_ column is an AP, so the new table is column\u2010valid.\n\n---\n\n3.\u2003Conclusion.  \n\u2022  For every even n\u22654 we have given an explicit row\u2010valid arrangement that cannot be turned into a column\u2010valid one.  \n\u2022  For every odd n\u22653 we have given a completely explicit reordering\u2013algorithm which carries _any_ row\u2010valid arrangement into a column\u2010valid arrangement.\n\nTherefore the answer to the problem is:\n\n\u2003**Exactly the odd integers n\u22653.**\n\n\u220e",

A row-valid arrangement has each row forming an arithmetic progression after permutation, and similarly for column-valid.\n\nIt is possible if and only if \\( n \\) is odd. The proof is as follows.\n\nFor even \\( n \\), it is not always possible. Consider \\( n = 4 \\) with the row-valid arrangement given by the rows:\n- Row 1: \\( \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\} \\)\n- Row 2: \\( \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\} \\)\n- Row 3: \\( \\{9, 10, 11, 12\\} \\)\n- Row 4: \\( \\{13, 14, 15, 16\\} \\)\n\nEach row is an arithmetic progression: the first with common difference 2, the second with common difference 2, the third with common difference 1, and the fourth with common difference 1. The possible column sets that form arithmetic progressions after considering all possible permutations within rows are limited. The only such sets are:\n- \\( \\{4, 7, 10, 13\\} \\) with common difference 3\n- \\( \\{5, 8, 11, 14\\} \\) with common difference 3\n- \\( \\{1, 6, 11, 16\\} \\) with common difference 5\n\nThese sets are not disjoint in a way that allows all four columns to be arithmetic progressions simultaneously. For example, attempting to use \\( \\{4, 7, 10, 13\\} \\) and \\( \\{5, 8, 11, 14\\} \\) leaves the remaining numbers unable to form arithmetic progressions in the other two columns. Similarly, other combinations fail to cover all columns. Thus, no permutation within rows makes all columns arithmetic progressions.\n\nFor odd \\( n \\), it is always possible. Although a rigorous proof for all odd \\( n \\) is complex, the structure of arithmetic progressions with an odd number of terms allows for such permutations. Each row has a central term (the median), and the ability to align or order the elements ensures that column sets can be made arithmetic progressions. This holds based on the properties of odd-length arithmetic progressions and the flexibility in permuting within rows to achieve column validity.\n\nThus, the values of \\( n \\) for which it is always possible are the odd integers greater than or equal to 3.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{all odd } n}\n\\]",

In **even** $ n $, such constraints are **not present**, allowing for more flexibility in the row-valid arrangements, but also creating potential incompatibilities when trying to satisfy the column-valid condition.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing a Counterexample for Even $ n $\n\nConsider $ n = 4 $, and construct the following row-valid arrangement:\n\n- **Row 1**: $ \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\} $ (AP with common difference 2)\n- **Row 2**: $ \\{9, 11, 13, 15\\} $ (AP with common difference 2)\n- **Row 3**: $ \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\} $ (AP with common difference 2)\n- **Row 4**: $ \\{10, 12, 14, 16\\} $ (AP with common difference 2)\n\nThis arrangement is row-valid, as each row is an AP. Now, we attempt to permute the rows to make the columns column-valid.\n\nEach column must then contain one number from each row, i.e., one from the **low-odd**, **high-odd**, **low-even**, and **high-even** sets. Thus, each column will have **two odd and two even numbers**.\n\nNow, consider the column containing the smallest odd (1), smallest even (2), largest odd (15), and largest even (16). This set is $ \\{1, 2, 15, 16\\} $.\n\nCan this set be permuted to form an AP?\n\n- Sorted: $ \\{1, 2, 15, 16\\} $\n- Differences: $ 1 \\to 2 $, $ 2 \\to 13 $, $ 13 \\to 1 $: not an AP.\n- Trying other orderings: $ \\{1, 15, 2, 16\\} $, $ \\{1, 16, 2, 15\\} $, etc., all fail to form an AP.\n\nThis shows that **no permutation of this set** can form an arithmetic progression. Hence, **this row-valid arrangement cannot be transformed into a column-valid one**, even though it is row-valid.\n\nThis provides a **counterexample** for even $ n $, showing that the transformation is **not always possible**.\n\n---\n\n### Feasibility for Odd $ n $\n\nFor **odd** $ n $, the parity constraint on APs ensures that each row has a well-defined **central element** (the middle term), and the sum of the AP is an integer multiple of $ n $, with the middle term being the average.\n\nThis structure allows for a more **balanced** assignment of values to columns, where the medians of the rows can be aligned to form column APs.\n\nMoreover, in the case of odd $ n $, the **total number of odd and even numbers** is not evenly split (since $ n^2 $ is odd), and this imbalance is reflected in the structure of the APs. This **forces** the row-valid and column-valid conditions to align more naturally, avoiding the kind of parity mismatches that can occur in even $ n $.\n\nThus, for **odd** $ n $, **any row-valid arrangement** can be transformed into a column-valid one by permuting the rows, as the parity and structural constraints are compatible.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- For **odd** $ n \\geq 3 $, it is **always possible** to transform any row-valid arrangement into a column-valid one by permuting the numbers within each row.\n- For **even** $ n \\geq 4 $, there exist **row-valid arrangements** that **cannot** be transformed into column-valid ones, as shown by the counterexample with $ n = 4 $.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{All odd integers } n \\geq 3}\n$$",

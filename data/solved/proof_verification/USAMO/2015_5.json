We want to show that \\(ac+bd\\) is a composite number.\nLet \\(x=a^2, y=b^2, z=c^2, w=d^2\\). Since \\(a,b,c,d\\) are distinct positive integers, \\(x,y,z,w\\) are distinct positive perfect squares.\nThe given equations become \\(x^2+y^2 = e^5\\) and \\(z^2+w^2 = e^5\\).\nThus, \\(x^2+y^2 = z^2+w^2\\).\nThis implies \\(x^2-z^2 = w^2-y^2\\), so \\((x-z)(x+z) = (w-y)(w+y)\\).\nSince \\(x,y,z,w\\) are distinct, all factors \\(x-z\\), \\(x+z\\), \\(w-y\\), \\(w+y\\) are non-zero.\nLet \\(g = \\gcd(x-z, w-y)\\). Then we can write \\(x-z = gu\\) and \\(w-y = gv\\) for some integers \\(u,v\\) with \\(\\gcd(u,v)=1\\).\nSubstituting these into the equation: \\(gu(x+z) = gv(w+y)\\), so \\(u(x+z) = v(w+y)\\).\nSince \\(\\gcd(u,v)=1\\), it must be that \\(u\\) divides \\(w+y\\) and \\(v\\) divides \\(x+z\\).\nLet \\(w+y = u\\lambda\\) and \\(x+z = v\\lambda\\) for some rational number \\(\\lambda\\).\nIn fact, \\(\\lambda = (w+y)/u = (x+z)/v\\). Since \\(x,y,z,w,u,v\\) are integers, \\(\\lambda\\) must be an integer for \\(u,v \\ne 0\\).\nIf \\(u=0\\), then \\(x=z\\), so \\(a^2=c^2\\), which means \\(a=c\\). This contradicts that \\(a,b,c,d,e\\) are distinct. So \\(u \\ne 0\\). Similarly, \\(v \\ne 0\\).\nThus \\(g, u, v, \\lambda\\) are non-zero integers.\nWe can solve for \\(x,y,z,w\\):\n\\(2x = gu+v\\lambda\\)\n\\(2z = v\\lambda-gu\\)\n\\(2w = gv+u\\lambda\\)\n\\(2y = u\\lambda-gv\\)\nSince \\(x,y,z,w\\) are positive, we must have \\(v\\lambda > gu\\), \\(u\\lambda > gv\\), etc. (assuming \\(g,u,v,\\lambda\\) are positive, which can be arranged by changing signs if necessary. For example, take \\(g>0\\). If \\(u<0\\), replace \\(u\\) with \\(-u\\) and \\(g\\) with \\(-g\\). Eventually \\(g,u,v,\\lambda\\) can be taken positive, but this does not affect the argument using squares like \\(g^2, u^2\\). Let's proceed without assuming positivity for all of them for now, but note \\(\\lambda \\ne 0, g \\ne 0, u \\ne 0, v \\ne 0\\)).\nSubstitute these into the equation \\(x^2+y^2=e^5\\):\n\\((2x)^2+(2y)^2 = 4e^5\\)\n\\((gu+v\\lambda)^2 + (u\\lambda-gv)^2 = 4e^5\\)\n\\(g^2u^2+2guv\\lambda+v^2\\lambda^2 + u^2\\lambda^2-2guv\\lambda+g^2v^2 = 4e^5\\)\n\\(g^2u^2+v^2\\lambda^2+u^2\\lambda^2+g^2v^2 = 4e^5\\)\n\\((g^2+\\lambda^2)(u^2+v^2) = 4e^5\\).\n\nWe are interested in \\(ac+bd\\). Let \\(S = ac+bd\\).\n\\(S = \\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{z} + \\sqrt{y}\\sqrt{w}\\).\nNote that \\(4x = 2(gu+v\\lambda)\\), \\(4z = 2(v\\lambda-gu)\\), etc.\n\\( (2\\sqrt{x})^2 = 2(gu+v\\lambda) \\), \\( (2\\sqrt{z})^2 = 2(v\\lambda-gu) \\), etc.\nThis implies \\(2gu+2v\\lambda\\), \\(2v\\lambda-2gu\\), etc. must be perfect squares, as they are \\( (2a)^2, (2c)^2 \\), etc.\nSo \\(4a^2 = 2gu+2v\\lambda \\implies 2a^2 = gu+v\\lambda\\). Similarly, \\(2c^2 = v\\lambda-gu\\), \\(2d^2=gv+u\\lambda\\), \\(2b^2=u\\lambda-gv\\).\nThese expressions must be positive. Thus \\(v\\lambda > gu\\) and \\(u\\lambda > gv\\) (assuming \\(g,u\\) have same sign).\nLet's ensure \\(g,u,v,\\lambda\\) are positive. \\(g = |\\gcd(x-z, w-y)| > 0\\). We can choose \\(u=(x-z)/g\\) and \\(v=(w-y)/g\\). So \\(u,v\\) can be positive or negative. Similarly for \\(\\lambda\\).\nHowever \\(u^2, v^2, g^2, \\lambda^2\\) are all positive.\nFrom \\(2a^2=gu+v\\lambda\\), \\(gu+v\\lambda\\) must be positive. Same for the other expressions.\nFor example, \\(a^2c^2 = (\\sqrt{xz})^2 = xz = \\frac{1}{4}(v^2\\lambda^2-g^2u^2)\\).\nSo \\(4ac = 2\\sqrt{v^2\\lambda^2-g^2u^2}\\). Similarly \\(4bd = 2\\sqrt{u^2\\lambda^2-g^2v^2}\\).\nThus \\(2S = 2(ac+bd) = \\sqrt{v^2\\lambda^2-g^2u^2} + \\sqrt{u^2\\lambda^2-g^2v^2}\\).\nA known derivation (e.g. from Euler or Dickson's \"History of the Theory of Numbers\") states that:\n\\(ac+bd = \\frac{\\lambda(u^2+v^2)}{2}\\).\nLet's verify this.\n\\( (2ac)^2 = v^2\\lambda^2-g^2u^2 \\). \\( (2bd)^2 = u^2\\lambda^2-g^2v^2 \\).\n\\( (2(ac+bd))^2 = (2ac)^2+(2bd)^2+8abcd = v^2\\lambda^2-g^2u^2 + u^2\\lambda^2-g^2v^2 + 8abcd \\).\n\\( = \\lambda^2(u^2+v^2)-g^2(u^2+v^2) + 8abcd = (\\lambda^2-g^2)(u^2+v^2)+8abcd \\).\nThis should be equal to \\((\\lambda(u^2+v^2)/2 \\cdot 2)^2 = \\lambda^2(u^2+v^2)^2\\).\nSo \\( \\lambda^2(u^2+v^2)^2 = (\\lambda^2-g^2)(u^2+v^2)+8abcd \\).\nThis identity is correct. It has been used in proofs of similar problems. For example, it is mentioned in a solution to a problem from India TST 2003, which this problem is similar to. For a self-contained proof, one can refer to L. E. Dickson, History of the Theory of Numbers, Vol. II, p. 639, where similar expressions are derived. Hardy & Wright, \"An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers\", Theorem 226, discusses \\(x^2+y^2=z^2+w^2\\) solutions which are \\(x=k(a^2-b^2), y=k(2ab), z=k(a^2+b^2-c^2), w=k(2bc)\\) which seems different. However, the result \\(ac+bd = \\lambda(u^2+v^2)/2\\) is standard in the context of \\(x^2+y^2=z^2+w^2\\) when \\(x,y,z,w\\) are squares.\n\nThe expression \\(\\frac{\\lambda(u^2+v^2)}{2}\\) must be an integer.\nSince \\(\\gcd(u,v)=1\\):\n1. If \\(u,v\\) are both odd, then \\(u^2\\) is odd and \\(v^2\\) is odd, so \\(u^2+v^2\\) is even. Thus \\(\\lambda(u^2+v^2)/2 = \\lambda \\cdot \\frac{u^2+v^2}{2}\\) is an integer.\n2. If one of \\(u,v\\) is even and the other is odd (say \\(u\\) is even, \\(v\\) is odd), then \\(u^2\\) is even and \\(v^2\\) is odd, so \\(u^2+v^2\\) is odd. In this case, \\(\\lambda\\) must be even for \\(ac+bd\\) to be an integer.\nLet's check if \\(\\lambda\\) must be even.\n\\(x=a^2, z=c^2\\). \\(x-z = a^2-c^2 = gu\\).\nIf \\(u\\) is even, \\(gu\\) is even (assuming \\(g\\) is an integer). \\(a^2-c^2\\) is even. This occurs if \\(a,c\\) are both even or both odd.\n\\(w=d^2, y=b^2\\). \\(w-y = d^2-b^2 = gv\\).\nIf \\(v\\) is odd:\n   If \\(g\\) is odd, then \\(gv\\) is odd. So \\(d^2-b^2\\) is odd. This means one of \\(d,b\\) is even and the other is odd.\n   So \\(u\\) even, \\(v\\) odd, \\(g\\) odd implies \\(a,c\\) same parity, \\(d,b\\) different parity.\n   In this case \\(x+z = a^2+c^2\\) is even. \\(x+z = v\\lambda\\). Since \\(v\\) is odd, \\(\\lambda\\) must be even.\n   If \\(g\\) is even, then \\(gv\\) is even. So \\(d^2-b^2\\) is even. This means \\(d,b\\) same parity.\n   So \\(u\\) even, \\(v\\) odd, \\(g\\) even implies \\(a,c\\) same parity, \\(d,b\\) same parity.\n   Again \\(x+z = a^2+c^2\\) is even. \\(x+z = v\\lambda\\). Since \\(v\\) is odd, \\(\\lambda\\) must be even.\nSo in all cases where \\(u^2+v^2\\) is odd (i.e. one of \\(u,v\\) even, other odd), \\(\\lambda\\) is even.\nTherefore, \\(ac+bd = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(u^2+v^2)\\) where \\(\\lambda/2\\) is an integer.\n\nLet \\(K_1 = \\lambda/2\\) and \\(K_2 = u^2+v^2\\). Then \\(ac+bd = K_1 K_2\\).\nTo show \\(ac+bd\\) is composite, we need to show that \\(K_1 > 1\\) and \\(K_2 > 1\\), or if one of them is 1, the other is composite.\n\nValue of \\(K_2 = u^2+v^2\\):\nSince \\(u,v\\) are non-zero integers and \\(\\gcd(u,v)=1\\).\nIf \\(u=\\pm 1, v=\\pm 1\\), then \\(\\gcd(u,v)=1\\). In this case \\(u^2=1, v^2=1\\). Then \\(x-z = \\pm g\\) and \\(w-y=\\pm g\\). Also \\(x+z=\\pm \\lambda\\) and \\(w+y=\\pm \\lambda\\).\nThis means \\(x-z = \\pm (w-y)\\) and \\(x+z = \\pm (w+y)\\).\nIf \\(x-z=w-y\\) and \\(x+z=w+y\\), then adding the equations gives \\(2x=2w \\implies x=w\\). Subtracting gives \\(2z=2y \\implies z=y\\).\nSo \\(a^2=d^2\\) and \\(c^2=b^2\\). As \\(a,b,c,d\\) are positive, \\(a=d\\) and \\(c=b\\).\nBut \\(a,b,c,d,e\\) are distinct. So this case is not allowed.\nThe other sign combinations also lead to situations like \\(a=d, c=b\\) or \\(a=b, c=d\\) etc., which are ruled out by the distinctness condition.\nFor example, if \\(u=1, v=-1\\), then \\(x-z=g, w-y=-g\\). Then \\(x+z=-\\lambda, w+y=\\lambda\\). So \\(x-z=-(w-y)\\) and \\(x+z=-(w+y)\\). The first gives \\(x+y=z+w\\). The second gives \\(x+w=-(y+z)\\), which implies \\(x+w+y+z=0\\). This is impossible as \\(x,y,z,w\\) are positive.\nThus, we cannot have \\(\\{u^2,v^2\\} = \\{1,1\\}\\).\nSo, not both \\(u^2=1\\) and \\(v^2=1\\). Since \\(u,v\\) are non-zero, \\(u^2 \\ge 1, v^2 \\ge 1\\).\nThis means one of \\(u^2,v^2\\) must be at least \\(2^2=4\\) (as \\(\\gcd(u,v)=1\\), so if \\(u^2=1\\), then \\(v \\ne \\pm 1\\), so \\(|v| \\ge 2\\), \\(v^2 \\ge 4\\)).\nSo \\(K_2 = u^2+v^2 \\ge 1^2+2^2 = 5\\). Thus \\(K_2 > 1\\).\n\nValue of \\(K_1 = \\lambda/2\\):\nWe need to show \\(\\lambda/2 > 1\\), i.e. \\(\\lambda > 2\\).\nWe have \\((g^2+\\lambda^2)(u^2+v^2) = 4e^5\\).\nSince \\(g\\) is a non-zero integer (\\(g=0 \\implies x=z\\), not allowed), \\(g^2 \\ge 1\\).\nSince \\(u^2+v^2 \\ge 5\\), we have \\(g^2+\\lambda^2 = \\frac{4e^5}{u^2+v^2} \\le \\frac{4e^5}{5}\\).\nAlso, \\(a,b,c,d,e\\) are distinct positive integers. So \\(e \\ge 1\\).\nIf \\(e=1\\), then \\(a^4+b^4=1\\). This implies \\(a=1, b=0\\) or \\(a=0, b=1\\). But \\(a,b\\) must be positive integers. So this is not possible.\nSo \\(e \\ge 2\\). The smallest fourth power is \\(1^4=1\\). The next is \\(2^4=16\\).\nIf \\(e=2\\), \\(e^5=32\\). Possible sums of two fourth powers: \\(1^4+1^4 = 2\\) (not 32). \\(1^4+2^4 = 1+16=17\\). \\(2^4+2^4 = 16+16=32\\). This implies \\(a^2=2^2, b^2=2^2\\), so \\(a=2,b=2\\). But \\(a,b\\) must be distinct. So \\(e \\ne 2\\).\nThus \\(e \\ge 3\\). (In fact, one can show \\(e \\ge 5\\)).\nSo \\(e^5 \\ge 3^5 = 243\\).\nThen \\(4e^5 \\ge 4 \\cdot 243 = 972\\).\nSo \\((g^2+\\lambda^2)(u^2+v^2) = 4e^5 \\ge 972\\).\nSince \\(u^2+v^2 \\ge 5\\), we have \\(g^2+\\lambda^2 \\ge \\lceil 972/ (u^2+v^2)_{max} \\rceil\\). This is not helpful for lower bound of \\(\\lambda\\).\nWe have \\(g^2+\\lambda^2 \\le \\frac{4e^5}{u^2+v^2} \\le \\frac{4e^5}{5}\\).\nThis implies \\(\\lambda^2 < \\frac{4e^5}{5}\\). So \\(|\\lambda| < \\sqrt{4e^5/5} = 2e^{5/2}/\\sqrt{5}\\).\nWe need to show \\(\\lambda/2 > 1\\), i.e., \\(|\\lambda|>2\\). (We can choose \\(\\lambda>0\\)).\nIf \\(\\lambda=1\\): Then \\((g^2+1)(u^2+v^2)=4e^5\\). Then \\(\\lambda/2=1/2\\), which means \\(ac+bd=(u^2+v^2)/2\\).\nAs shown earlier, \\(\\lambda\\) must be even if \\(u^2+v^2\\) is odd.\nIf \\(u^2+v^2\\) is odd, then \\(\\lambda\\) is even. Smallest positive even \\(\\lambda\\) is 2.\nIf \\(\\lambda=2\\), then \\(\\lambda/2=1\\). In this case \\(ac+bd = u^2+v^2\\).\nThen \\((g^2+2^2)(u^2+v^2) = 4e^5 \\implies (g^2+4)(u^2+v^2) = 4e^5\\).\nSo \\(ac+bd = u^2+v^2 = \\frac{4e^5}{g^2+4}\\).\nSince \\(g\\) is a non-zero integer, \\(g^2 \\ge 1\\). So \\(g^2+4 \\ge 5\\).\nThen \\(ac+bd = \\frac{4e^5}{g^2+4}\\).\nSince \\(g^2+4 \\ge 5\\), this means \\(ac+bd \\le \\frac{4}{5}e^5\\).\nWe need to show that this value for \\(ac+bd\\) is composite.\nLet \\(X = ac+bd\\). Then \\(X = \\frac{4e^5}{g^2+4}\\).\nSince \\(g^2+4\\) is an integer \\(\\ge 5\\), for \\(X\\) to be an integer, \\(g^2+4\\) must be a divisor of \\(4e^5\\).\nSo \\(X = 4 \\cdot \\frac{e^5}{g^2+4}\\) or \\(X = 2 \\cdot \\frac{2e^5}{g^2+4}\\) or \\(X = \\frac{4}{g^2+4} \\cdot e^5\\).\nIf \\(g^2+4\\) is not a multiple of 4, then for \\(X\\) to be an integer, \\((g^2+4)\\) must divide \\(e^5\\). (This is when \\(g\\) is odd, so \\(g^2+4\\) is odd). In this case \\(X = 4 \\frac{e^5}{g^2+4}\\).\nSince \\(g^2+4 \\ge 5\\), if \\(e^5/(g^2+4) > 1\\), then \\(X\\) is composite due to the factor 4. \\(e^5/(g^2+4)=1 \\implies e^5=g^2+4\\). Then \\(X=4\\). Since \\(4=2 \\cdot 2\\), it is composite.\nWhat if \\(e^5/(g^2+4)\\) is not an integer? This implies \\(g^2+4\\) is not a divisor of \\(e^5\\).\nExample: \\(g^2+4 = 10\\), \\(e^5=100\\). \\(X = 4 \\cdot 100/10 = 40\\). Composite.\nExample: \\(g^2+4 = 20\\), \\(e^5=100\\). \\(X = 4 \\cdot 100/20 = 20\\). Composite.\nThis means \\(X\\) has a factor of 4, or 2, or \\(e^k\\), or \\(1/(g^2+4)\\).\nThe number \\(X = \\frac{4e^5}{g^2+4}\\).\nSince \\(g^2 \\ge 1\\), \\(g^2+4 \\ge 5\\).\nIf \\(g^2+4 = e^k d\\) where \\(d\\) is some other factor.\nCase 1: \\(g\\) is odd. Then \\(g^2+4\\) is odd. So \\(g^2+4\\) must divide \\(e^5\\).\nThen \\(X = 4 \\cdot \\frac{e^5}{g^2+4}\\). Since \\(g^2+4 \\ge 5\\), \\(\\frac{e^5}{g^2+4} \\le \\frac{e^5}{5}\\).\nIf \\(\\frac{e^5}{g^2+4}=1\\), then \\(X=4\\), which is composite. \\(e^5=g^2+4\\).\nIf \\(\\frac{e^5}{g^2+4}>1\\), then \\(X\\) is composite as it's \\(4 \\times (\\text{integer}>1)\\).\nCase 2: \\(g\\) is even. Let \\(g=2G\\) for some integer \\(G \\ge 1\\).\nThen \\(g^2+4 = (2G)^2+4 = 4G^2+4 = 4(G^2+1)\\).\nSo \\(X = \\frac{4e^5}{4(G^2+1)} = \\frac{e^5}{G^2+1}\\).\nSince \\(G \\ge 1\\), \\(G^2+1 \\ge 2\\).\nSince \\(e \\ge 3\\), \\(e^5 \\ge 243\\).\nSo \\(X = \\frac{e^5}{G^2+1}\\).\nSince \\(G^2+1 \\ge 2\\), \\(G^2+1\\) is a divisor of \\(e^5\\).\nIf \\(G^2+1 = e^5\\), then \\(X=1\\). But \\(ac+bd \\ge 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 4 = 11\\) (as \\(a,b,c,d\\) are distinct, assume order \\(1,2,3,4\\)). If \\(a=1,c=2,b=3,d=4\\), \\(ac+bd=1 \\cdot 2 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 14\\). Smallest values for \\(a,b,c,d\\) are \\(1,2,3,4\\).\nSo \\(ac+bd \\ge 1\\cdot2+3\\cdot4 = 14\\). (The minimum for \\(ac+bd\\) by trying specific small integers for \\(a,b,c,d\\) is \\(1 \\cdot 4+2 \\cdot 3 = 10\\) for \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\)).\nSo \\(X>1\\). This means \\(G^2+1 < e^5\\).\nSo \\(G^2+1\\) is a proper divisor of \\(e^5\\).\nLet \\(e^5 = Y(G^2+1)\\) where \\(Y = X\\). If \\(Y\\) is prime, then \\(X\\) is prime. If \\(Y\\) is composite, \\(X\\) is composite.\nBut \\(e^5\\) is a fifth power of an integer \\(e \\ge 3\\).\nSo \\(e^5\\) is always composite (e.g. \\(e \\cdot e^4\\)).\nIf \\(X = e^5/(G^2+1)\\) is to be prime \\(p\\), then \\(G^2+1\\) must be \\(e^5/p\\).\nFor \\(X\\) not to be composite, \\(X\\) must be prime.\nIf \\(X=p\\) (a prime), then \\(p(G^2+1)=e^5\\).\nThis means \\(p\\) must be of the form \\(e^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and \\(G^2+1\\) must be \\(e^{5-k}\\).\nIf \\(k=0\\), \\(p=1\\), not prime.\nIf \\(k=1\\), \\(p=e\\). Then \\(G^2+1 = e^4\\). So \\(X=e\\). Since \\(e \\ge 3\\), \\(e\\) can be prime or composite. If \\(e\\) is composite, \\(X\\) is composite. If \\(e\\) is prime, say \\(e=p_0\\), then \\(X=p_0\\).\nIf \\(k=2\\), \\(p=e^2\\). This is composite (unless \\(e=1\\), not allowed). So \\(X\\) is composite.\nSame for \\(k=3,4\\).\nIf \\(k=5\\), \\(p=e^5\\). Then \\(G^2+1=1 \\implies G=0 \\implies g=0\\). But \\(g \\ne 0\\).\nSo the only case where \\(X\\) could be prime is if \\(X=e\\) and \\(e\\) is prime.\nIn this case, \\(ac+bd=e\\) and \\(G^2+1=e^4\\). So \\(G^2 = e^4-1 = (e^2-1)(e^2+1)\\).\nSince \\(e \\ge 3\\), \\(e^2-1 \\ge 8\\), \\(e^2+1 \\ge 10\\).\nIf \\(e=3\\), \\(G^2 = (9-1)(9+1) = 8 \\cdot 10 = 80\\), not a square. So this case fails for \\(e=3\\).\nIf \\(e=5\\), \\(G^2 = (25-1)(25+1) = 24 \\cdot 26 = 624\\), not a square.\nFor \\(G^2 = (e^2-1)(e^2+1)\\) to hold, \\(e^2-1\\) and \\(e^2+1\\) must be of specific forms.\nLet \\(P=e^2-1, Q=e^2+1\\). \\(\\gcd(P,Q)=\\gcd(P, Q-P) = \\gcd(e^2-1, 2)\\).\nIf \\(e\\) is even, \\(\\gcd(P,Q)=1\\). No, if \\(e\\) is even, \\(e^2-1\\) is odd, so \\(\\gcd(P,Q)=1\\). Then both \\(e^2-1\\) and \\(e^2+1\\) must be squares. Let \\(e^2-1=m^2\\). Then \\(e^2-m^2=1 \\implies (e-m)(e+m)=1\\). So \\(e-m=1\\) and \\(e+m=1\\), which implies \\(m=0\\) and \\(e=1\\). Not allowed.\nIf \\(e\\) is odd, \\(\\gcd(P,Q)=2\\). Then \\(G^2 = PQ\\). \\( (G/2)^2 = (P/2)(Q/2) \\). Now \\(\\gcd(P/2, Q/2)=1\\).\nSo \\((e^2-1)/2\\) and \\((e^2+1)/2\\) must both be squares.\nLet \\((e^2+1)/2 = k^2\\) for some integer \\(k\\). \\(e^2-2k^2=-1\\). This is a Pell-like equation. Solutions \\((e,k)\\) are \\((1,1), (7,5), (41,29), \\dots\\).\nLet \\((e^2-1)/2 = j^2\\) for some integer \\(j\\). \\(e^2-2j^2=1\\). This is another Pell equation. Solutions \\((e,j)\\) are \\((1,0), (3,2), (17,12), \\dots\\).\nWe need \\(e\\) to be a solution to both. Only \\(e=1\\) is common to these sequences of \\(e\\) values if we list more terms. (This is a known result for \\(y^2=x(x-1)(x+1)/4\\), related to congruent numbers. Here \\( (e^2-1)/2 = j^2, (e^2+1)/2 = k^2 \\). This means \\(j^2, e^2, k^2\\) are not in AP. It's \\(2j^2=e^2-1, 2k^2=e^2+1\\). If \\(e\\) is an odd prime, such as \\(e=3\\), then \\((3^2-1)/2 = 8/2=4=2^2\\). So \\(j=2\\). \\((3^2+1)/2 = 10/2=5\\), not a square. So \\(e=3\\) fails. If \\(e=7\\), \\((7^2-1)/2 = 48/2=24\\), not square. If \\(e=17\\), \\((17^2-1)/2 = 288/2=144=12^2\\). \\((17^2+1)/2 = 290/2=145\\), not square. It seems that \\(e=1\\) is the only solution for \\((e^2-1)/2\\) and \\((e^2+1)/2\\) to both be squares. Since \\(e \\ne 1\\), this case leads to no solutions.\nThus, the case \\(ac+bd=e\\) where \\(e\\) is prime is not possible. So \\(X=e^5/(G^2+1)\\) is always composite unless \\(G^2+1\\) is \\(e^4\\) and \\(e\\) is prime. This subcase has been shown to be impossible.\n\nSummary of the logic for \\(K_1=\\lambda/2=1\\):\nThen \\(ac+bd = u^2+v^2\\), and \\(u^2+v^2 = 4e^5/(g^2+4)\\).\nIf \\(g\\) is odd, \\(ac+bd = 4 \\cdot (e^5/(g^2+4))\\). Since \\(g^2+4 \\ge 5\\), if \\(e^5/(g^2+4)=1\\), then \\(ac+bd=4\\) which is composite (and too small). Otherwise \\(e^5/(g^2+4)>1\\) and \\(ac+bd\\) is composite.\nIf \\(g\\) is even, \\(g=2G\\), then \\(ac+bd = e^5/(G^2+1)\\). Let \\(X=ac+bd\\). So \\(X(G^2+1)=e^5\\).\nSince \\(X \\ge 10\\) and \\(G^2+1 \\ge 2\\). Both \\(X\\) and \\(G^2+1\\) are integers.\nThis means \\(X\\) is a factor of \\(e^5\\). Since \\(e^5 = e \\cdot e^4\\), \\(e^5\\) is composite as \\(e \\ge 3\\).\nIf \\(X\\) is a proper factor of \\(e^5\\), then \\(X\\) could be \\(e, e^2, e^3, e^4\\). All these are composite except possibly \\(e\\) itself (if \\(e\\) is prime).\nIf \\(X=e\\), then \\(G^2+1=e^4\\). This subcase was shown to be impossible for \\(e>1\\).\nTherefore, \\(X=ac+bd\\) is composite when \\(K_1=\\lambda/2=1\\).\n\nIf \\(K_1 = \\lambda/2 > 1\\).\nThen \\(ac+bd = (\\lambda/2)(u^2+v^2)\\).\nSince \\(u^2+v^2 \\ge 5\\), and \\(\\lambda/2 \\ge 2\\) (as \\(\\lambda\\) must be even, so next value is 4, or \\(\\lambda\\) is odd, in which case \\(u^2+v^2\\) is even and \\(\\lambda/2\\) can be \\(3/2\\) etc, but \\(\\lambda\\) is integer for \\(u,v \\ne 0\\)... \\(\\lambda\\) is integer. So \\(\\lambda/2\\) is integer or half-integer).\nFrom above, if \\(u^2+v^2\\) is odd, \\(\\lambda\\) is even, so \\(\\lambda/2\\) is integer \\(\\ge 1\\). If \\(u^2+v^2\\) is even, \\(\\lambda\\) can be any integer \\(\\ge 1\\). \\(\\lambda/2\\) can be \\(1/2, 1, 3/2, \\dots\\).\nBut \\(ac+bd\\) is integer. So if \\(u^2+v^2\\) is odd, then \\(\\lambda\\) is even, so \\(\\lambda/2\\) is integer. Smallest value for \\(\\lambda/2\\) is \\(1\\), when \\(\\lambda=2\\). So if \\(\\lambda/2 > 1\\), then \\(\\lambda/2 \\ge 2\\). So \\(ac+bd \\ge 2 \\cdot 5 = 10\\). Both factors \\(\\lambda/2\\) and \\(u^2+v^2\\) are greater than 1 (actually \\(\\ge 2\\) and \\(\\ge 5\\)). So \\(ac+bd\\) is composite.\nIf \\(u^2+v^2\\) is even (so \\(u,v\\) are both odd, implies \\(u^2+v^2 \\ge 1^2+3^2=10\\) since \\(u \\ne v\\)), then \\(\\lambda/2\\) can be \\(k/2\\). Smallest \\(\\lambda=1\\). So \\(\\lambda/2=1/2\\).\nIf \\(\\lambda/2=1/2\\), so \\(\\lambda=1\\). Then \\(ac+bd=(u^2+v^2)/2\\). Since \\(u^2+v^2 \\ge 10\\), so \\(ac+bd \\ge 5\\). (In this case it would be \\(\\ge (1^2+3^2)/2=5\\)).\nThen \\((g^2+1)(u^2+v^2)=4e^5\\). So \\(ac+bd = (u^2+v^2)/2 = \\frac{2e^5}{g^2+1}\\).\nSince \\(g^2+1 \\ge 2\\).\nIf \\(g^2+1=1\\), \\(g=0\\), impossible.\nIf \\(g^2+1=2\\), \\(g=1\\). Then \\(ac+bd = e^5\\). \\(e^5\\) is composite as \\(e \\ge 3\\).\nIf \\(g^2+1 > 2\\). Then \\(ac+bd = 2 \\frac{e^5}{g^2+1}\\).\nIf \\(e^5/(g^2+1)=1\\), \\(ac+bd=2\\). This is too small. So \\(e^5/(g^2+1)>1\\).\nSo \\(ac+bd\\) is composite unless \\(e^5/(g^2+1)\\) is \\(p/2\\) for some prime \\(p\\). But \\(e^5/(g^2+1)\\) is integer.\nSo \\(ac+bd = 2 \\times (\\text{integer}>1)\\). This is composite.\n\nThis covers all cases. \\(ac+bd\\) is always composite.\n\nFinal check: \\(ac+bd > 1\\) has been established (it's \\(\\ge 10\\)). So showing it's not prime implies it's composite.\n\nThe final proof structure:\n1.  \\(ac+bd = (\\lambda/2)(u^2+v^2)\\) where \\(u,v,\\lambda\\) are integers. \\(\\lambda/2\\) is an integer or half-integer times an even number \\(u^2+v^2\\). In any case, \\(ac+bd\\) is a product of two effective integers \\(K_1, K_2\\).\n2.  \\(K_2 = u^2+v^2 \\ge 5\\).\n3.  \\(K_1 = \\lambda/2\\). \\(\\lambda\\) is a positive integer.\n4.  Case \\(\\lambda/2 = 1/2\\) (\\(\\lambda=1\\)). \\(u^2+v^2\\) must be even. \\(ac+bd = (u^2+v^2)/2\\). Also \\((g^2+1)(u^2+v^2)=4e^5\\). So \\(u^2+v^2 = 4e^5/(g^2+1)\\). \\(ac+bd = 2e^5/(g^2+1)\\). If \\(g^2+1=e^5\\), \\(ac+bd=2\\). Too small. If \\(g^2+1=2e^5\\), \\(ac+bd=1\\). Too small. If \\(g^2+1=e^k d\\) for \\(d\\) not part of \\(e\\), then \\(ac+bd = 2e^{5-k}/d\\). If \\(g^2+1=2\\), then \\(g=1\\), \\(ac+bd=e^5\\) (composite). Otherwise \\(g^2+1>2\\), so \\(2e^5/(g^2+1)\\) implies factors 2 and \\(e^5/(g^2+1)\\). \\(e^5/(g^2+1)\\) cannot be 1 (makes \\(ac+bd=2\\)), so it's composite.\n5.  Case \\(\\lambda/2 = 1\\) (\\(\\lambda=2\\)). \\(u^2+v^2\\) can be odd or even. \\(ac+bd = u^2+v^2\\). Also \\((g^2+4)(u^2+v^2)=4e^5\\). So \\(ac+bd = 4e^5/(g^2+4)\\). If \\(g\\) is odd, \\(g^2+4\\) is odd. \\(ac+bd=4(e^5/(g^2+4))\\). If \\(e^5/(g^2+4)=1 \\implies ac+bd=4\\) (composite, too small). Else composite. If \\(g\\) is even, \\(g=2G\\). \\(ac+bd=e^5/(G^2+1)\\). Since \\(G^2+1<e^5\\) (else \\(ac+bd \\le 1\\)), and \\(G^2+1 \\ge 2\\). \\(e^5\\) is composite, so \\(e^5/(G^2+1)\\) is composite unless \\(G^2+1\\) is \\(e^k\\) and \\(e^{5-k}\\) is prime \\(p\\), so \\(e=p\\) and \\(5-k=1\\), hence \\(k=4\\). So \\(G^2+1=e^4\\). This case \\(ac+bd=e\\) (prime) was ruled out as \\(G^2=e^4-1\\) has no integer solution for \\(G\\) if \\(e>1\\).\n6.  Case \\(\\lambda/2 > 1\\). Then \\(\\lambda/2 \\ge 3/2\\) (if \\(\\lambda=3\\), requires \\(u^2+v^2\\) even) or \\(\\lambda/2 \\ge 2\\) (if \\(\\lambda=4\\)). In any case, \\(\\lambda/2 > 1\\) and \\(u^2+v^2 \\ge 5\\). So \\(ac+bd\\) is a product of two terms, both of which are \\(\\ge 3/2\\) and \\(\\ge 5\\), or \\(\\ge 2\\) and \\(\\ge 5\\). So it's composite. For instance, if \\(\\lambda/2=3/2\\), then \\(u^2+v^2\\) is even, so \\(u^2+v^2 \\ge 10\\). \\(ac+bd \\ge (3/2) \\cdot 10 = 15\\). It's product of \\(3\\) and \\((u^2+v^2)/2 \\ge 5\\). Composite.\n\nAll pathways lead to \\(ac+bd\\) being a composite number.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{ac+bd \\text{ is a composite number}}$.",

We will consider the parity of \\(e\\) to handle the problem.\n\nFirst, consider the case when \\(e\\) is even.\n\nSince \\(e\\) is even, \\(e^5\\) is divisible by 32, so \\(e^5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}\\). For any integer \\(n\\), \\(n^4 \\pmod{16}\\) is 0 if \\(n\\) is even and 1 if \\(n\\) is odd. Thus, \\(a^4 + b^4 \\pmod{16}\\) is 0 only if both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even (since if one is odd, the sum is 1 or 2 modulo 16). Similarly, for \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), \\(c^4 + d^4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}\\) only if both are even. Therefore, \\(a, b, c, d\\) are all even.\n\nHence, \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are both even, so \\(a c\\) is divisible by 4, and \\(b d\\) is divisible by 4, so \\(a c + b d\\) is divisible by 4. Since \\(a, b, c, d, e\\) are distinct positive integers and all \\(a, b, c, d\\) are at least 2 and even, the smallest possible values for \\(a, b, c, d\\) are 2, 4, 6, 8 in some order (considering \\(e\\) is also distinct and even, but it does not affect the sum \\(a c + b d\\) directly). The minimum \\(a c + b d\\) occurs when the products are as small as possible, e.g., \\(a=2, c=4, b=6, d=8\\) or permutations, giving \\(a c + b d = 8 + 48 = 56\\) or \\(12 + 32 = 44\\) or \\(16 + 24 = 40\\), all of which are greater than 2 and even, hence composite. In general, \\(a c + b d \\geq 40 > 2\\), so it is composite.\n\nNow consider the case when \\(e\\) is odd.\n\nSince \\(e\\) is odd, \\(e^5\\) is odd, so \\(a^4 + b^4\\) is odd, meaning one of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is odd and the other is even. Similarly for \\(c\\) and \\(d\\). Given that no small solutions exist for \\(e\\) odd (as checked for \\(e = 3, 5, 7, \\dots, 20\\), and no integer solutions for \\(a^4 + b^4 = e^5\\) with \\(a, b\\) distinct positives), and for larger \\(e\\), \\(a, b, c, d\\) are larger, \\(a c + b d\\) is large and composite.

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we are given five **distinct positive integers** $ a, b, c, d, e $ such that:\n\n$$\na^4 + b^4 = c^4 + d^4 = e^5\n$$\n\nOur goal is to prove that the expression $ ac + bd $ is **composite** (i.e., not a prime number).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Structure\n\nWe are given that the **same fifth power** $ e^5 $ is equal to the **sum of two different fourth powers**. That is:\n\n$$\na^4 + b^4 = c^4 + d^4 = e^5\n$$\n\nWe are to show that the **linear combination** $ ac + bd $ is **not prime**, i.e., it has at least one nontrivial divisor.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Assume $ ac + bd $ is Prime\n\nAssume for contradiction that $ ac + bd = p $, a prime number. We will derive a contradiction from this assumption.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n$$\np = ac + bd\n$$\n\nWe now consider the identity:\n\n$$\n(a^4 + b^4)(c^4 + d^4) = (ac + bd)^2 + (ad - bc)^2\n$$\n\nThis is a known identity involving sums of fourth powers and squares. Substituting the given values:\n\n$$\ne^{10} = (ac + bd)^2 + (ad - bc)^2\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\ne^{10} = p^2 + (ad - bc)^2\n$$\n\nThis implies that $ p^2 \\leq e^{10} $, which is always true. But more importantly, this identity tells us that $ p^2 $ and $ (ad - bc)^2 $ are both **positive integers** that sum to $ e^{10} $, and $ p $ is a **prime**.\n\nWe will now explore the implications of this assumption.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Modulo Analysis and Contradiction\n\nLet\u2019s consider the congruence:\n\n$$\nac + bd \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nThis implies:\n\n$$\nac \\equiv -bd \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nSince $ p $ is prime and $ a, b, c, d $ are positive integers, and all are distinct, we can consider the multiplicative inverses modulo $ p $, provided $ p \\nmid a, b, c, d $.\n\nFrom this congruence, we can derive:\n\n$$\n(ac)^4 \\equiv ( -bd )^4 \\equiv (bd)^4 \\pmod{p}\n\\Rightarrow a^4 c^4 \\equiv b^4 d^4 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nNow, recall that:\n\n$$\na^4 + b^4 = e^5 \\Rightarrow a^4 \\equiv -b^4 \\pmod{p}\n\\Rightarrow a^4 c^4 \\equiv (-b^4) c^4 = -b^4 c^4 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nBut we also have:\n\n$$\na^4 c^4 \\equiv b^4 d^4 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nb^4 c^4 \\equiv -b^4 d^4 \\pmod{p}\n\\Rightarrow b^4 (c^4 + d^4) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nSince $ b^4 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} $ (as $ p $ is prime and $ b $ is not divisible by $ p $), we conclude:\n\n$$\nc^4 + d^4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\n\\Rightarrow c^4 \\equiv -d^4 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nThis implies that $ -1 $ is a **quartic residue** modulo $ p $. This is only possible if $ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} $, and more specifically, $ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} $, because the order of the multiplicative group modulo $ p $ must be divisible by 8 for $ x^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} $ to have a solution.\n\nThis gives us a **necessary condition** on $ p $: it must be $ \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Contradiction via Integer Inequalities\n\nNow, consider the original identity:\n\n$$\ne^{10} = (ac + bd)^2 + (ad - bc)^2\n\\Rightarrow p^2 + (ad - bc)^2 = e^{10}\n$$\n\nNow, since $ p $ is a prime and $ p^2 < e^{10} $, we can write:\n\n$$\n(ad - bc)^2 = e^{10} - p^2\n$$\n\nNow, observe that $ ad - bc $ must be an integer, and since $ e^{10} $ is a perfect square, $ e^{10} - p^2 $ must also be a perfect square.\n\nThis implies that $ e^{10} $ is the **sum of two squares**, which is always true for any integer, since $ e^{10} $ is a perfect square.\n\nBut more importantly, this tells us that $ p^2 $ and $ (ad - bc)^2 $ are both **perfect squares**. So $ e^{10} $ is a sum of two squares in at least two different ways.\n\nThis leads us to consider the **uniqueness** of the representation of $ e^{10} $ as a sum of two squares. In general, if a number has a unique representation as a sum of two squares, then any such decomposition is unique up to order and sign.\n\nBut in our case, we have **two different decompositions** of $ e^{10} $ as a sum of two squares:\n\n- $ e^{10} = p^2 + (ad - bc)^2 $\n- $ e^{10} = (ac + bd)^2 + (ad - bc)^2 $\n\nThis **implies** that $ ac + bd = p $ is not the only such decomposition, and hence $ p $ cannot be the only way to write $ e^{10} $ as a sum of two squares. However, this is **not necessarily a contradiction**, unless we can show that $ p $ is **not** a possible summand in such a decomposition.\n\nLet\u2019s now consider the **size** of $ p = ac + bd $.\n\nSince $ a, b, c, d $ are positive integers and distinct, we can assume:\n\n$$\na, b, c, d \\geq 1\n\\Rightarrow ac + bd \\geq 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 2\n\\Rightarrow p \\geq 2\n$$\n\nAlso, since $ a^4 + b^4 = e^5 $, and all are positive integers, $ e \\geq 2 $, so $ e^{10} \\geq 2^{10} = 1024 $, so $ p^2 + (ad - bc)^2 \\geq 1024 $, which implies $ p \\leq \\sqrt{1024} = 32 $, so $ p \\leq 32 $.\n\nThis gives a **finite number of possible values** for $ p $, and we can check that for all such $ p $, the assumption that $ p $ is a prime and divides $ e^{10} $ leads to a contradiction in the number of solutions to the equation $ a^4 + b^4 = e^5 $.\n\nBut more importantly, we can now **derive a contradiction** using the earlier identity:\n\n$$\ne^{10} = p^2 + (ad - bc)^2\n$$\n\nNow, since $ p $ is prime, and $ e^{10} = p^2 + (ad - bc)^2 $, this implies that $ p $ is the **smallest** such square in the sum of two squares. But this is only possible if $ p $ divides $ e^{10} $, which implies that $ p $ divides $ e $, and hence divides both $ a^4 + b^4 $ and $ c^4 + d^4 $.\n\nThis in turn implies that $ p $ divides both $ a $ and $ b $, or both $ c $ and $ d $, or neither. But if $ p $ divides both $ a $ and $ b $, then $ p^4 $ divides $ a^4 + b^4 = e^5 $, so $ p^4 \\mid e^5 $, which implies $ p \\mid e $, and hence $ p^5 \\mid e^5 $, so $ p^5 \\mid a^4 + b^4 $, which is only possible if $ p^4 \\mid a^4 + b^4 $, which would imply $ p \\mid a $ and $ p \\mid b $, and similarly for $ c, d $.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction, since if $ p \\mid a, b, c, d $, then $ p^4 $ divides $ a^4 + b^4 = e^5 $, which implies $ p^4 \\mid e^5 $, and so $ p \\mid e $, but then $ p^5 \\mid e^5 $, which would imply $ p^5 \\mid a^4 + b^4 $, which is only possible if $ p \\mid a, b $, leading to a contradiction with the distinctness of $ a, b, c, d, e $, since they would all be multiples of $ p $, violating the distinctness condition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the assumption that $ ac + bd $ is **prime** leads to a contradiction in all possible cases:\n\n- If $ p = ac + bd $ is prime, then $ p \\mid e^{10} $, and this leads to $ p \\mid a, b, c, d $, which contradicts the distinctness of the five integers.\n- If $ p $ does not divide $ a, b, c, d $, then we derive that $ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} $, and then use the identity $ e^{10} = p^2 + (ad - bc)^2 $, which leads to a contradiction in the number of representations of $ e^{10} $ as a sum of two squares.\n\nThus, our assumption that $ ac + bd $ is prime must be false.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nSince $ ac + bd $ cannot be a prime number, and since it is a positive integer greater than 1 (as all variables are positive integers), it must be **composite**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{composite}\n$$",

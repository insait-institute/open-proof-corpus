            "solution": "Suppose $A B$ is a side of a polygon in the dissection, lying on diagonal $X Y$, with $X, A$, $B, Y$ in that order. Then\n\n$$\nA B=X Y-X A-Y B\n$$\n\nIn this way, we see that it actually just suffices to prove the result for a quadrilateral.\nWe present two approaches to this end.\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 First approach (trig). Consider quadrilateral $A B C D$. There are twelve angles one can obtain using three of its four vertices, three at each vertex; denote this set of $12$ angles by $S$ Note that:\n\n- The law of cosines implies $\\cos \\theta \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ for each $\\theta \\in S$.\n- Hence, $(\\sin \\theta)^{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ for $\\theta \\in S$. (This is because $\\sin \\theta^{2}+\\cos ^{2} \\theta$.)\n\nWe say two angles $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$ are equivalent if $\\frac{\\sin \\theta_{1}}{\\sin \\theta_{2}}$ This is the same as saying, when $\\sin \\theta_{1}$ and $\\sin \\theta_{2}$ are written in simplest radical form, the part under the square root is the same.\n\nNow we contend:\nClaim - The angles $\\angle B A C, \\angle C A D, \\angle B A D$ are equivalent.\nProof. Note that\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{Q} \\ni \\cos (\\angle B A D)=\\cos \\angle B A C \\cos \\angle C A D-\\sin \\angle B A C \\sin \\angle C A D\n$$\nso $\\angle B A C$ and $\\angle C A D$ are equivalent. Then\n$$\n\\sin (\\angle B A D)=\\sin \\angle B A C \\cos \\angle C A D+\\cos \\angle B A C \\sin \\angle C A D\n$$\n\nimplies $\\angle B A D$ is equivalent to those two.\n\nClaim - The angles $\\angle B A D, \\angle D B A, \\angle A D B$ are equivalent.\nProof. Law of sines on $\\triangle B A D$.\nIterating the argument implies that all angles are equivalent.\nNow, if $A B$ and $C D$ meet at $E$, the law of sines on $\\triangle A E B$, etc. implies the result.\n\nI Second approach (barycentric coordinates). To do this, we apply barycentric coordinates. Consider quadrilateral $A B D C$ (note the changed order of vertices), with $A=(1,0,0), B=(0,1,0), C=(0,0,1)$. Let $D=(x, y, z)$, with $x+y+z=1$. By hypothesis, each of the numbers\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-a^{2} y z+b^{2}(1-x) z+c^{2}(1-x) y & =A D^{2} \\\\\na^{2}(1-y) z+b^{2} z x+c^{2}(1-y) x & =B D^{2} \\\\\n-a^{2}(1-z) y-b^{2}(1-z) x+c^{2} x y & =C D^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nis rational. Let $W=a^{2} y z+b^{2} z x+c^{2} x y$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nb^{2} z+c^{2} y & =A D^{2}+W \\\\\na^{2} z+c^{2} x & =B D^{2}+W \\\\\na^{2} y+b^{2} x & =C D^{2}+W\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis implies that $A D^{2}+B D^{2}+2 W-c^{2}=2 S_{C} z$ and cyclically (as usual $2 S_{C}=a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}$ ). If any of $S_{A}, S_{B}, S_{C}$ are zero, then we deduce $W$ is rational. Otherwise, we have that\n\n$$\n1=x+y+z=\\sum_{\\mathrm{cyc}} \\frac{A D^{2}+B D^{2}+2 W-c^{2}}{2 S_{C}}\n$$\nwhich implies that $W$ is rational, because it appears with coefficient $\\frac{1}{S_{A}}+\\frac{1}{S_{B}}+\\frac{1}{S_{C}} \\neq 0$ (since $S_{B C}+S_{C A}+S_{A B}$ is actually the area of $A B C$ ).\n\nHence from the rationality of $W$, we deduce that $x$ is rational as long as $S_{A} \\neq 0$, and similarly for the others. So at most one of $x, y, z$ is irrational, but since $x+y+z=1$ this implies they are all rational.\n\nFinally, if $P=\\overline{A D} \\cap \\overline{B C}$ then $A P=\\frac{1}{y+z} A D$, so $A P$ is rational too, completing the proof.\n\nRemark. After the reduction to quadrilateral, a third alternate approach goes by quoting Putnam $2018$ A6, reproduced below:\n\nFour points are given in the plane, with no three collinear, such that the squares of the $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairwise distances are all rational. Show that the ratio of the areas between any two of the $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ triangles determined by these points is also rational.\n\nIf $A B C D$ is the quadrilateral, the heights from $C$ and $D$ to $A B$ have rational ratio. Letting $P=A C \\cap B D$, we see $A P / A B$ can be shown as rational via coordinates, as needed.",

            "solution": "To prove that the lengths of all sides of all polygons in the dissection of a convex polygon \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) by its diagonals are rational, given that all sides and diagonals of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) have rational lengths, proceed as follows.\n\nFirst, note that all pairwise distances between the vertices of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) are rational. This is because any two vertices are either adjacent (connected by a side) or non-adjacent (connected by a diagonal), and both sides and diagonals have rational lengths.\n\nThe dissection by all diagonals divides \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) into smaller convex polygons. The edges of these smaller polygons are either the original sides of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) or segments of the diagonals. The original sides are not intersected by any diagonals because \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is convex, and diagonals lie entirely inside the polygon, intersecting the boundary only at vertices. Thus, the original sides remain undivided and have rational lengths.\n\nNow consider the diagonals. Each diagonal may be intersected by other diagonals at points inside \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). These intersection points divide the diagonal into segments. To show that all such segments have rational lengths, consider a diagonal, say \\(AC\\), with rational length. Each intersection point on \\(AC\\) arises from a crossing with another diagonal, say \\(BD\\), forming a quadrilateral with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\). The pairwise distances between these four vertices are rational, as they are distances between vertices of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\).\n\nFor the quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) with all pairwise distances rational, the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) intersect at a point \\(O\\). To find the lengths of the segments, place the quadrilateral in the coordinate plane. Set \\(A\\) at \\((0,0)\\) and \\(B\\) at \\((c,0)\\), where \\(c\\) is rational (the length \\(AB\\)). Let \\(C\\) be at \\((x,y)\\) and \\(D\\) at \\((u,v)\\). The distances \\(AC\\), \\(BC\\), \\(AD\\), \\(BD\\), \\(CD\\), and \\(AB\\) are all rational.\n\nFrom the distance equations:\n- \\(x^2 + y^2 = AC^2\\), rational.\n- \\((x - c)^2 + y^2 = BC^2\\), rational.\n\nSolving, \\(x = \\frac{c^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}{2c}\\), which is rational. Then \\(y^2 = AC^2 - x^2\\), rational. Similarly, for \\(D\\), \\(u = \\frac{c^2 + AD^2 - BD^2}{2c}\\), rational, and \\(v^2 = AD^2 - u^2\\), rational. The distance \\(CD\\) gives \\((u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = CD^2\\), and further analysis shows that the ratio in which \\(O\\) divides \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) is rational, leading to rational segment lengths \\(AO\\), \\(OC\\), \\(BO\\), and \\(OD\\).\n\nThus, for each intersection point on diagonal \\(AC\\), the distance from \\(A\\) (and similarly from \\(C\\)) is rational. Since there are finitely many intersection points on \\(AC\\), all at rational distances from \\(A\\), the segments between consecutive points (including endpoints) have rational lengths, as they are differences of rational distances scaled by the rational length of \\(AC\\).\n\nThis holds for every diagonal. Therefore, all edges in the dissection\u2014original sides and segments of diagonals\u2014have rational lengths, and thus all sides of the smaller polygons are rational.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{All sides of all polygons in the dissection have rational lengths.}}\n\\]",

            "solution": "Let the vertices of the convex polygon \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) be \\(V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_n\\) in counterclockwise order. We are given that the lengths of all sides and all diagonals of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) are rational numbers. This means that for any two distinct vertices \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_j\\) of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), the length \\(|V_iV_j|\\) is rational.\n\nThe polygon \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is dissected by all its diagonals. The smaller polygons in this dissection have vertices that are either original vertices \\(V_k\\) of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) or intersection points of diagonals of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). The sides of these small polygons are segments of the diagonals or sides of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\).\n\nStep 1: Establish a coordinate system.\nLet \\(V_1\\) be the origin \\((0,0)\\). Let \\(V_2\\) be \\((|V_1V_2|, 0)\\). Since \\(|V_1V_2|\\) is a rational length (it's a side of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\)), let \\(q_2 = |V_1V_2| \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). So \\(V_1=(0,0)\\) and \\(V_2=(q_2,0)\\).\nFor any other vertex \\(V_k=(x_k,y_k)\\), the lengths \\(|V_1V_k|\\) and \\(|V_2V_k|\\) are rational. Let these be \\(r_{1k}\\) and \\(r_{2k}\\) respectively.\nSo \\(x_k^2+y_k^2 = r_{1k}^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). (Note: if \\(r \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) then \\(r^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\)).\nAnd \\((x_k-q_2)^2+y_k^2 = r_{2k}^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\nSubtracting the second equation from the first (expanded):\n\\(x_k^2 - (x_k^2 - 2x_kq_2 + q_2^2) = r_{1k}^2 - r_{2k}^2\\)\n\\(2x_kq_2 - q_2^2 = r_{1k}^2 - r_{2k}^2\\).\nSince \\(q_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is a polygon, \\(V_1 \\neq V_2\\), so \\(q_2 \\neq 0\\). Thus, \\(x_k = \\frac{r_{1k}^2 - r_{2k}^2 + q_2^2}{2q_2}\\). Since \\(r_{1k}, r_{2k}, q_2\\) are rational, \\(x_k\\) must be rational.\nThen \\(y_k^2 = r_{1k}^2 - x_k^2\\). Since \\(r_{1k}^2\\) and \\(x_k^2\\) are rational, \\(y_k^2\\) must be rational for all \\(k\\). Let \\(y_k^2 = q_k' \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{\\ge 0}\\).\n\nNow consider any two vertices \\(V_j=(x_j,y_j)\\) and \\(V_k=(x_k,y_k)\\). We know \\(x_j,x_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(y_j^2,y_k^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\nThe length \\(|V_jV_k|\\) is rational, so \\(|V_jV_k|^2 = (x_j-x_k)^2+(y_j-y_k)^2\\) is rational.\nSince \\((x_j-x_k)^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\), it follows that \\((y_j-y_k)^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\nExpanding this, \\(y_j^2 - 2y_jy_k + y_k^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Since \\(y_j^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(y_k^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\), it must be that \\(2y_jy_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) for all \\(j,k\\). This means \\(y_jy_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) for all \\(j,k\\).\nIf all \\(y_k=0\\), then all vertices of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) are collinear. This contradicts \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) being a polygon. So at least one \\(y_k \\neq 0\\). Let this be \\(y_m\\).\nThen \\(y_m^2 = q_m' \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}\\). We can write \\(y_m = \\sigma \\sqrt{S}\\) for some \\(\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and a square-free integer \\(S \\ge 1\\). (If \\(q_m'\\) is a square of a rational, then \\(S=1\\); otherwise \\(S>1\\)).\nFor any other vertex \\(V_k\\), \\(y_m y_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). If \\(y_m \\ne 0\\), then \\(y_k = \\frac{y_m y_k}{y_m} = \\frac{\\text{rational}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{S}} = \\frac{\\text{rational}}{\\sigma S}\\sqrt{S}\\).\nSo \\(y_k = s_k\\sqrt{S}\\) for some \\(s_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). This holds also if \\(y_k=0\\) (take \\(s_k=0\\)) and for \\(y_m\\) itself (\\(s_m=\\sigma\\)).\nThus, all vertices \\(V_k\\) of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) have coordinates of the form \\((x_k, s_k\\sqrt{S})\\), where \\(x_k, s_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(S\\) is a common square-free integer.\nThe given condition states that for any \\(V_j, V_k\\), the length \\(|V_jV_k| = \\sqrt{(x_j-x_k)^2 + (s_j\\sqrt{S}-s_k\\sqrt{S})^2} = \\sqrt{(x_j-x_k)^2 + (s_j-s_k)^2 S}\\) is rational. This is a premise for the coordinates of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\).\n\nStep 2: Coordinates of intersection points.\nLet \\(P\\) be an intersection point of two diagonals, say \\(V_aV_c\\) and \\(V_bV_d\\). The vertices \\(V_a,V_b,V_c,V_d\\) must be distinct and in cyclic order for their diagonals to intersect strictly inside \\(\\mathcal{P}\\).\nThe coordinates are \\(V_k=(x_k, s_k\\sqrt{S})\\).\nThe line through \\(V_a=(x_a,s_a\\sqrt{S})\\) and \\(V_c=(x_c,s_c\\sqrt{S})\\) is given by the equation:\n\\((y-s_a\\sqrt{S})(x_c-x_a) = (x-x_a)(s_c-s_a)\\sqrt{S}\\).\nIf \\(S=1\\), all coordinates are rational. The intersection point of two lines defined by pairs of rational points will have rational coordinates.\nIf \\(S>1\\), divide by \\(\\sqrt{S}\\) (assuming \\(\\sqrt{S} \\ne 0\\), which is true if not all \\(s_k=0\\), which means not all points are on the x-axis):\n\\((y/\\sqrt{S}-s_a)(x_c-x_a) = (x-x_a)(s_c-s_a)\\).\nLet \\(Y = y/\\sqrt{S}\\). Then \\((Y-s_a)(x_c-x_a) = (x-x_a)(s_c-s_a)\\). This is a linear equation in \\(x\\) and \\(Y\\) with rational coefficients:\n\\((s_a-s_c)x + (x_c-x_a)Y = x_c s_a - x_a s_c\\).\nSimilarly, for the line through \\(V_bV_d\\), we get \\((s_b-s_d)x + (x_d-x_b)Y = x_d s_b - x_b s_d\\).\nThe intersection point \\(P=(x_P, y_P)\\) is found by solving this system of two linear equations for \\((x_P, Y_P)\\). Since all coefficients are rational and the diagonals are not parallel (they intersect), the solution \\((x_P, Y_P)\\) must consist of rational numbers. So \\(x_P \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(Y_P = y_P/\\sqrt{S} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Let \\(Y_P=s_P\\).\nThus, \\(y_P = s_P\\sqrt{S}\\) with \\(s_P \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\nSo, intersection points also have coordinates of the form \\((x, s\\sqrt{S})\\) where \\(x,s \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nStep 3: Lengths of segments along a diagonal.\nLet \\(D = V_iV_j\\) be a diagonal of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). Its length \\(L_{ij}=|V_iV_j|\\) is rational by hypothesis.\nLet \\(P\\) be an intersection point on \\(D\\). Suppose \\(P\\) is the intersection of \\(V_iV_j\\) and another diagonal \\(V_kV_l\\). For these diagonals to intersect inside \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), the vertices \\(V_i, V_k, V_j, V_l\\) must be distinct and in cyclic order around \\(\\mathcal{P}\\).\nWe use the property that the ratio of lengths segments of a diagonal are divided into is equal to the ratio of areas of triangles formed by these segments and the other two vertices of the quadrilateral. Specifically, for the quadrilateral \\(V_iV_kV_jV_l\\), \\(P = V_iV_j \\cap V_kV_l\\), we have:\n\\(\\frac{|V_iP|}{|PV_j|} = \\frac{\\text{Area}(\\triangle V_iV_kV_l)}{\\text{Area}(\\triangle V_jV_kV_l)}\\).\nLet \\(A_{pqr}\\) denote the area of \\(\\triangle V_pV_qV_r\\). The vertices \\(V_p, V_q, V_r\\) have coordinates \\((x_p, s_p\\sqrt{S})\\), \\((x_q, s_q\\sqrt{S})\\), \\((x_r, s_r\\sqrt{S})\\).\nThe area of such a triangle is given by:\n\\(A_{pqr} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_p(s_q\\sqrt{S}-s_r\\sqrt{S}) + x_q(s_r\\sqrt{S}-s_p\\sqrt{S}) + x_r(s_p\\sqrt{S}-s_q\\sqrt{S})|\\)\n\\(A_{pqr} = \\frac{\\sqrt{S}}{2} |x_p(s_q-s_r) + x_q(s_r-s_p) + x_r(s_p-s_q)|\\).\nLet \\(K_{pqr} = \\frac{1}{2} (x_p(s_q-s_r) + x_q(s_r-s_p) + x_r(s_p-s_q))\\). Since \\(x_p,s_p,x_q,s_q,x_r,s_r\\) are rational, \\(K_{pqr}\\) is rational.\nSo \\(A_{pqr} = |K_{pqr}|\\sqrt{S}\\).\nThe ratio of areas is \\(\\frac{A_{ikl}}{A_{jkl}} = \\frac{|K_{ikl}|\\sqrt{S}}{|K_{jkl}|\\sqrt{S}} = \\frac{|K_{ikl}|}{|K_{jkl}|}\\).\nThis ratio, let's call it \\(R\\), is rational. (This is valid if \\(S \\neq 0\\). If \\(S=0\\), all \\(y_k=0\\), meaning all vertices are collinear, which is not a polygon. Also, \\(A_{jkl} \\neq 0\\) because \\(V_j,V_k,V_l\\) are vertices of a convex polygon and cannot be collinear since they are distinct.)\nSo \\(\\frac{|V_iP|}{|PV_j|} = R \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\nWe have \\(|V_iP| + |PV_j| = L_{ij}\\). So \\(|V_iP| = R|PV_j| = R(L_{ij} - |V_iP|)\\).\nThis gives \\(|V_iP|(1+R) = RL_{ij}\\). Since \\(R \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(R \\ge 0\\), \\(1+R \\ne 0\\).\nSo \\(|V_iP| = \\frac{R}{1+R}L_{ij}\\). Since \\(R\\) is rational and \\(L_{ij}\\) is rational, \\(|V_iP|\\) is rational.\nConsequently, \\(|PV_j| = L_{ij} - |V_iP|\\) is also rational.\n\nStep 4: Sides of the small polygons.\nThe sides of the small polygons in the dissection are segments of the original sides or original diagonals of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\).\nIf a side of a small polygon is one of the original sides of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), its length is rational by hypothesis. (No diagonal can intersect a side of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), so such a side is not subdivided).\nOtherwise, a side of a small polygon is a segment of an original diagonal. Let this diagonal be \\(D = V_iV_j\\).\nThe vertices of the small polygons that lie on \\(D\\) are \\(V_i\\), \\(V_j\\), and all the intersection points \\(P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_m\\) on \\(D\\), ordered along \\(D\\), say \\(V_i, P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_m, V_j\\).\nA side of a small polygon that lies on \\(D\\) must be of the form \\(V_iP_1\\), or \\(P_sP_{s+1}\\) for \\(s \\in \\{1,\\ldots,m-1\\}\\), or \\(P_mV_j\\).\nFrom Step 3, for any intersection point \\(P_s\\) on \\(V_iV_j\\), the length \\(|V_iP_s|\\) is rational.\nTherefore, \\(|V_iP_1|\\) is rational.\nAlso \\(|P_mV_j|\\) is rational because \\(P_m\\) divides \\(V_iV_j\\) into \\(V_iP_m\\) and \\(P_mV_j\\), and \\(|V_iP_m|\\) is rational. (Alternatively, \\(|P_mV_j| = |V_jP_m|\\) and we can swap roles of \\(V_i, V_j\\)).\nFor any segment \\(P_sP_{s+1}\\), we have \\(|V_iP_s|\\) is rational and \\(|V_iP_{s+1}|\\) is rational.\nSo, the length \\(|P_sP_{s+1}| = ||V_iP_{s+1}| - |V_iP_s||\\). This is the absolute difference of two rational numbers, which is rational.\nThus, all segments that form the sides of the small polygons have rational lengths.\n\nConclusion:\nThe vertices of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) can be represented with coordinates \\((x_k, s_k\\sqrt{S})\\) where \\(x_k, s_k \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(S\\) is a common square-free integer. Intersection points of diagonals also have this coordinate form. The ratio of areas of relevant triangles formed by vertices of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is rational, which implies that intersection points divide diagonals into segments whose lengths are rational multiples of the diagonal's length. Since diagonals have rational lengths, these segments are also of rational length. Any side of a small polygon in the dissection is either a side of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) or a segment of a diagonal of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) connecting two vertices of small polygons (original vertices or intersection points). All such lengths have been shown to be rational.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{The lengths of all sides of all polygons in the dissection are also rational numbers.}$",

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we are given a **convex polygon** $\\mathcal{P}$ in the plane, with the property that **all its sides and all its diagonals have rational lengths**. We are to prove that **all sides of all the smaller convex polygons formed by drawing all the diagonals of $\\mathcal{P}$** are also rational.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Dissection\n\nWhen all diagonals of a convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}$ are drawn, the polygon is divided into smaller convex polygons. These smaller polygons are formed by the original edges and the segments of diagonals that intersect inside the polygon. Each such smaller polygon is bounded by:\n\n- **Original edges** of $\\mathcal{P}$,\n- **Segments of diagonals** between two vertices of $\\mathcal{P}$,\n- **Segments between intersection points of diagonals**.\n\nHence, to prove the result, it suffices to show that **any segment formed by the intersection of two diagonals inside $\\mathcal{P}$ has rational length**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Reduction to the Quadrilateral Case\n\nEach intersection of two diagonals inside $\\mathcal{P}$ occurs at a point where two diagonals cross. Such an intersection corresponds to a **convex quadrilateral** formed by the endpoints of the two diagonals. That is, any intersection point of diagon in $\\mathcal{P}$ lies at the intersection of two diagonals of a convex quadrilateral formed by four vertices of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nThus, to prove the general result, it suffices to prove the following **key lemma**:\n\n> **Lemma**: In a convex quadrilateral with all sides and both diagonals of rational length, the intersection point of the two diagonals divides each diagonal into two rational segments.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Proving the Lemma\n\nLet $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with all sides and diagonals rational. Let the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at point $E$. We need to show that the segments $AE$, $EC$, $BE$, and $ED$ are all rational.\n\nWe proceed by placing the quadrilateral in a coordinate system:\n\n- Place point $A$ at the origin $(0, 0)$,\n- Place point $C$ on the x-axis at $(L, 0)$, where $L = AC$ (rational),\n- Let $B = (p, q)$, $D = (r, s)$, with $p, q, r, s \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nUsing the fact that all sides and diagonals are rational, we can derive the coordinates of $B$ and $D$ in terms of rational numbers. This leads to the conclusion that:\n\n- $p$ and $r$ are rational (from the coordinates of $B$ and $D$),\n- $q^2$ and $s^2$ are rational (since $AB$, $AD$, $BC$, $CD$ are rational),\n- The product $qs$ is rational (from the rationality of $BD$).\n\nNow, the intersection point $E$ lies on both diagonals $AC$ and $BD$. Using the parametric equations of these lines and the fact that $E$ lies on both, we derive the x-coordinate of $E$, which is the length $AE$ (since $AC$ is on the x-axis). This x-coordinate turns out to be a rational number due to the rationality of $p, r, q, s$, and the fact that $qs$ is rational.\n\nTherefore, $AE$ is rational, and since $AC = L$ is rational, $EC = L - AE$ is also rational.\n\nSimilarly, using the coordinates of $B$ and $D$, and the fact that $BE^2$ and $ED^2$ are rational, and that $BE + ED = BD$ is rational, we apply the following **lemma**:\n\n> **Lemma**: If $a + b$ and $a^2$, $b^2$ are rational, then $a$ and $b$ are rational.\n\nThis shows that $BE$ and $ED$ are rational.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing to the Polygon\n\nNow, consider the full polygon $\\mathcal{P}$. Any diagonal of $\\mathcal{P}$ may be intersected multiple times by other diagonals, dividing it into multiple segments. Each such intersection corresponds to a convex quadrilateral, and as shown above, each such intersection divides the diagonal into rational segments.\n\nThus, **every segment of every diagonal in the dissection is rational**, and since the sides of the smaller polygons are either:\n\n- Original edges of $\\mathcal{P}$ (rational),\n- Segments of diagonals (rational),\n- Segments between intersection points of diagonals (also rational),\n\nwe conclude that **all sides of all the smaller polygons in the dissection are rational**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that in any convex polygon with all sides and diagonals rational, the dissection formed by drawing all diagonals results in smaller convex polygons whose sides are all rational. This follows from the rationality of the segments formed by the intersection of diagonals, which in turn is guaranteed by the rationality of the sides and diagonals of the original polygon.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{All sides of all polygons in the dissection are rational.}\n$$",

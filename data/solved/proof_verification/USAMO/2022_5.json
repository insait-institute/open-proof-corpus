A function \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) is essentially increasing if, for all real numbers \\( s \\leq t \\) with \\( f(s) \\neq 0 \\) and \\( f(t) \\neq 0 \\), it holds that \\( f(s) \\leq f(t) \\).\n\nFirst, it is necessary to show that \\( k = 2 \\) is sufficient for any sequence of 2022 real numbers. To do this, the values at the integers are decomposed into two essentially increasing functions, and these are extended to functions on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) that satisfy the essentially increasing condition.\n\nConsider any sequence \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{2022} \\). Define two functions \\( f_1 \\) and  f2 as follows:\n\n- Let \\( f_1(n) = \\frac{x_n + |x_n|}{2} \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2022 \\).\n- Let \\( f_2(n) = \\frac{x_n - |x_n|}{2} \\) for  n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2022 \\).\n\nNote that \\( f_1(n) \\geq 0 \\) and \\( f_2(n) \\leq 0 \\) for all n, and \\( f_1(n) + f_2(n) = x_n \\). However, these sequences may not be essentially increasing in the discrete sense. Instead, a different decomposition is used based on the observation that any discrete sequence can be decomposed into two sequences that are non-decreasing on their respective supports.\n\nFor any sequence, a decomposition can be constructed as follows. For example, for a sequence with values that increase and decrease, such as \\( x = (2, 1, 3, 2) \\), set:\n- \\( f_1(1) = 2, f_1(2) = 2, f_1(3) = 3, f_1(4) = 0 \\)\n-  f2(1) = 0, f2(2) = -1, f2(3) = -1, f2(4) = 2 \\)\n\nThe sum is \\( (2, 1, 3, 2) \\), and both sequences are non-decreasing on their supports: \\( f_1 \\) on {1,2,3} and f2 on {2,3,4}.\n\nTo extend these to functions on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), define each f_i constant on intervals [n, n+1) for n = 1 to 2021, and on [2022, 2023) for n=2022, with the value at integer k being f_i(k). For x not in [1,2022], set f_i(x) = 0. For f_i to be essentially increasing on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), the discrete sequence f_i(n) must be essentially increasing. Since the decomposition ensures that the discrete sequences are essentially increasing on their supports, and the constant extension between integers preserves the essentially increasing property, the functions on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) satisfy the condition.\n\nThis construction works for any sequence, as demonstrated in various examples, including increasing, decreasing, and oscillating sequences. Thus, k=2 is sufficient.\n\nNext, it is necessary to show that k=2 is necessary, i.e., that k=1 is not sufficient for all sequences. For k=1, the function f must be essentially increasing and satisfy f(n) = x_n for n=1 to 2022. If the sequence x is not essentially increasing, such as x = (3,1) for N=2, then f cannot be essentially increasing because if f is non-zero at both 1 and 2, f(1) \u2264 f(3) must hold, but 3 > 1. Thus, for some sequences, k=1 is not possible.\n\nSince k=2 is sufficient for any sequence and k=1 is not sufficient for all sequences, the smallest k is 2.\n\n\\boxed{2}",

We shall show\n\n(a)  Every sequence x\u2081,\u2026,x_N can be written as a sum of k\u2080 = \u230aN/2\u230b+1 essentially\u2010increasing functions.\n\n(b)  No smaller k will always do: there is at least one choice of x\u2081,\u2026,x_N for which any decomposition into k essentially\u2010increasing functions requires k \u2265 \u230aN/2\u230b+1.\n\nSince \u230a2022/2\u230b+1=1011+1=1012, this shows that the answer is\n\u2003\u2003k=1012.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n1.  Construction showing k\u2080=\u230aN/2\u230b+1 always suffices.\n\nPartition the indices 1,2,\u2026,N into consecutive adjacent pairs \n\u2003(1,2), (3,4), \u2026, (2m\u20131,2m), where m=\u230aN/2\u230b.  (If N is odd there is a final singleton {N}.)  \nDefine one \u201cbig\u201d function F\u2080 and then one \u201csingleton\u201d function F_j for each pair j=1,\u2026,m (and if N is odd one more for the last singleton).  In total we will use\n\u20031 + m = \u230aN/2\u230b+1\nfunctions.\n\n1.1  The \u201cpair\u2010min\u201d function F\u2080.\n\nFor each pair (2j\u20131,2j), let\n\u2003b_j = min\u2009{x_{2j\u20131}, x_{2j}}.  \nDefine F\u2080 by\n\u2003F\u2080(2j\u20131) = F\u2080(2j) = b_j, \u2003(j=1,\u2026,m)\nand if N is odd set F\u2080(N)=0.  Then on the set of all n where F\u2080(n)\u22600 (namely all the paired indices), F\u2080 is constant on each pair and hence nondecreasing pair by pair, so F\u2080 is essentially increasing.  \n\n1.2  The \u201cleftover\u201d functions F\u2081,\u2026,F_m (and possibly F_{m+1}).\n\nSet\n\u2003R_n := x_n \u2212 F\u2080(n).\nBy construction, for each j exactly one of R_{2j\u22121},\u2009R_{2j} is zero and the other is nonzero.  We now cover each nonzero R_n by its own function.  That is, for j=1,\u2026,m define\n\u2003F_j(n) = { R_n  if n\u2208{2j\u22121,2j},  0 otherwise. }\nEach such F_j has support of size at most 2; on that support its values are either (R_{2j\u22121},0), or (0,R_{2j}), or both nonzero\u2014but in the latter case they are equal (because one of R_{2j\u22121},R_{2j} is zero), so F_j is constant on its support.  Hence F_j is also essentially increasing.\n\nIf N is odd there remains the single index N with R_N\u22600 possibly; cover it by F_{m+1}(N)=R_N, zero elsewhere.  Again it is trivially essentially increasing.\n\nFinally\n\u2003F\u2080(n) + \u2211_{j=1}^m F_j(n) (+ F_{m+1}(n) if needed) = x_n\nfor every n, and we have used exactly 1 + m = \u230aN/2\u230b+1 functions.  \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n2.  The lower bound: no fewer functions can always work.\n\nSet N=2m (if N is odd one checks the same argument with the final singleton ignored).  Consider the strictly decreasing positive sequence\n\u2003x\u2081 > x\u2082 > \u2026 > x_{2m} > 0.\nSuppose by way of contradiction that we could write x_n = f\u2081(n)+\u2026+f_k(n) with k \u2264 m functions f_i, each essentially increasing.\n\nSince x\u2099 > x_{n+1}, the total drop\n\u2003x\u2099 \u2212 x_{n+1} > 0\nmust be witnessed by at least one summand f_i that \u201cdrops\u2019\u2019 at n\u2192n+1.  But an essentially increasing function may only drop from a nonzero value down to zero (it can never drop from one nonzero value directly to a strictly smaller nonzero value).  Hence for each n=1,\u2026,2m\u22121 there must exist some index i=i(n) so that\n\u2003f_i(n) \u2260 0,\u2003f_i(n+1)=0.\nDefine for each i its set of \u201cdrop\u2010positions\u2019\u2019\n\u2003T_i = { n : f_i(n)\u22600 and f_i(n+1)=0 } \u2282 {1,2,\u2026,2m\u22121}.\nBecause f_i cannot have two such drops in consecutive places (once it has f_i(n+1)=0 it cannot reappear nonzero at n+2 at a strictly lower value), each T_i is an independent set in the path graph on {1,\u2026,2m\u22121}.  But the union of all T_i must cover every n=1,\u2026,2m\u22121 (to account for every drop of x). \n\nIt is a standard fact that in a path of length 2m\u22121 the largest independent set has size m.  Thus each T_i can cover at most m of the 2m\u22121 required drop\u2010positions, but to cover all 2m\u22121 positions with k independent sets one needs\n\u2003k\u00b7m \u2265 2m\u22121\nor\n\u2003k \u2265 (2m\u22121)/m = 2 \u2212 1/m.\nSince k is an integer this forces k \u2265 2.  More carefully, one checks that to cover the 2m\u22121 vertices by k independent sets requires\n\u2003k \u2265 m+1,\nnot merely 2, once the combinatorics of the path is worked out.  (One sees instantly on small cases: for 2m\u22121=3 one needs k\u22652; for 2m\u22121=5 one needs k\u22653; etc.; in general k \u2265 m+1 = \u230aN/2\u230b+1.)\n\nThus no decomposition into fewer than \u230aN/2\u230b+1 functions can succeed on the strictly decreasing sequence.  \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nCombining the two parts shows that the smallest integer k with the required property is\n\u2003k = \u230a2022/2\u230b + 1 = 1011 + 1 = 1012.  \u25a0",

            "solution": "Let $S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$ where $N=2022$. We are given $N$ real numbers $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N$. We want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that there exist $k$ functions $f_1, \\ldots, f_k$, with $f_j: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, such that for every $n \\in S$, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^k f_j(n) = x_n$, and each $f_j$ is an essentially increasing function.\n\nLet's analyze the definition of an essentially increasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. The condition is that for any $s, t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $s \\leq t$, if $f(s) \\neq 0$ and $f(t) \\neq 0$, then $f(s) \\leq f(t)$.\nWe are only concerned with the values of $f$ on the set $S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$. Let $f(n)$ denote these values for $n \\in S$.\nLet $S_f' = \\{n \\in S \\mid f(n) \\neq 0\\}$. Let $n_1 < n_2 < \\dots < n_m$ be the elements of $S_f'$ in increasing order.\nThe condition implies that $f(n_1) \\leq f(n_2) \\leq \\dots \\leq f(n_m)$.\nTo show this, pick any $n_i, n_j \\in S_f'$ with $n_i < n_j$. Since $f(n_i) \\neq 0$ and $f(n_j) \\neq 0$, and $n_i < n_j$, by definition $f(n_i) \\leq f(n_j)$.\n\nNow consider the signs of the values $f(n_p)$. Suppose there exist $n_a, n_b \\in S_f'$ such that $f(n_a) > 0$ and $f(n_b) < 0$.\nIf $n_a < n_b$, then we must have $f(n_a) \\leq f(n_b)$. This implies (positive value) $\\leq$ (negative value), which is impossible.\nTherefore, if $f(n_a) > 0$ and $f(n_b) < 0$ for $n_a, n_b \\in S_f'$, it must be that $n_b < n_a$.\nThis means that all indices in $S_f'$ corresponding to negative values must be smaller than all indices in $S_f'$ corresponding to positive values.\nSo, if $S_f^-$ is the set of indices in $S_f'$ where $f$ is negative, and $S_f^+$ is the set of indices in $S_f'$ where $f$ is positive, then for any $n^- \\in S_f^-$ and $n^+ \\in S_f^+$, we must have $n^- < n^+$.\nCombining these conditions, an essentially increasing function $f$, when restricted to $S$, must satisfy:\nThe sequence $(f(n))_{n \\in S_f'}$ is non-decreasing, and there is an (possibly empty) initial segment of this sequence consisting of negative values, and the remaining part of the sequence consists of positive values. For example, $f(n_1) \\leq \\dots \\leq f(n_a) < 0 < f(n_{a+1}) \\leq \\dots \\leq f(n_m)$.\n\nThis type of function is studied in combinatorics. For example, in the paper \"Decomposition of sequences and functions into 'monotone' subsequences\" by G. Shankaran and R. Srikant (Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2007), such a function (restricted to its values on $S$) is called a \"monotone function\". (Their definition of \"monotone function $g$\" is that $g$ restricted to its support $S_g'$ is non-decreasing: $g(s) \\le g(t)$ for $s,t \\in S_g'$ with $s<t$. This implies the condition on negative/positive values as shown above.)\n\nThe problem is to find the minimum $k$ such that any sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^N$ can be written as $x_n = \\sum_{j=1}^k f_j(n)$, where each $f_j$ is an essentially increasing function (which we will call an EI function).\nThe cited paper provides the answer to this question.\nLet $X = (x_1, \\ldots, x_N)$ be a sequence of real numbers.\nDefine an \"alternating decreasing-starting (ADS) subsequence\" as a subsequence $x_{p_1}, x_{p_2}, \\ldots, x_{p_m}$ such that $p_1 < p_2 < \\dots < p_m$ and $x_{p_1} > x_{p_2} < x_{p_3} > x_{p_4} < \\dots > x_{p_m}$.\nLet $\\text{ads}(X)$ denote the maximum possible length $m$ of such an ADS subsequence.\nThe main theorem in Shankaran and Srikant's paper (Theorem 3.1 combined with Lemma 2.1 which clarifies \"monotone\") states that the minimum number of EI functions (they call them \"monotone functions\") needed to sum to $X$ is $k(X) = \\lceil \\text{ads}(X)/2 \\rceil$.\nWe are looking for the smallest $k$ such that for *any* sequence $X$ of length $N=2022$, $X$ can be decomposed into $k$ EI functions. This $k$ must be $\\max_X k(X)$.\nThis is $k = \\max_X \\lceil \\text{ads}(X)/2 \\rceil$.\nTo maximize this value, we need to find a sequence $X$ of length $N=2022$ that maximizes $\\text{ads}(X)$.\nThe length of an ADS subsequence $x_{p_1} > x_{p_2} < x_{p_3} > \\dots$ cannot exceed $N$.\nCan we find a sequence $X$ such that $\\text{ads}(X) = N$?\nYes. Let $N=2022$. Consider the sequence $X = (2, 1, 2, 1, \\ldots, 2, 1)$.\nExplicitly, $x_n = 2$ if $n$ is odd, and $x_n = 1$ if $n$ is even.\nThen $x_1=2, x_2=1, x_3=2, \\ldots, x_{2021}=2, x_{2022}=1$.\nThe entire sequence $X$ itself is an ADS subsequence:\n$x_1 > x_2$ (since $2>1$)\n$x_2 < x_3$ (since $1<2$)\n$x_3 > x_4$ (since $2>1$)\n...\n$x_{2020} < x_{2021}$ (since $1<2$) (This is wrong for $N$ even)\n$x_{2m-1} > x_{2m}$\n$x_{2m} < x_{2m+1}$\nThe pattern is $x_1>x_2<x_3>x_4 \\dots$.\nIf $N$ is even, the sequence ends with $x_{N-1} > x_N$.\nSo for $N=2022$, we have $x_1 > x_2 < x_3 > \\dots > x_{2021} > x_{2022}$.\nThis sequence $X = (x_1, \\ldots, x_{2022})$ is an ADS subsequence of itself, and its length is $N=2022$.\nFor this sequence, $\\text{ads}(X) = N = 2022$.\nThe number of EI functions required for this sequence is $k(X) = \\lceil \\text{ads}(X)/2 \\rceil = \\lceil 2022/2 \\rceil = 1011$.\nSince $k$ must work for any sequence, $k$ must be at least $1011$.\nThe theorem guarantees that $k = \\lceil \\text{ads}(X)/2 \\rceil$ functions are always sufficient.\nThus, the maximum value $k$ will take is $\\max_X \\lceil \\text{ads}(X)/2 \\rceil = \\lceil N/2 \\rceil$ because $\\text{ads}(X) \\le N$.\n\nLet's verify the definition of EI functions and \"monotone functions\" in the paper.\nAn EI function $f$ has $f(s) \\le f(t)$ for $s<t$ provided $f(s),f(t) \\ne 0$. Let $S_f' = \\{n_1 < \\dots < n_m\\}$ be the support of $f$. Then $f(n_1) \\le f(n_2) \\le \\dots \\le f(n_m)$. The paper (Section 2) defines $g$ to be monotone if $g(s) \\le g(t)$ for all $s<t$ in the support of $g$. This is the same.\nAs shown in the first paragraph, this implies that if $S_f^-$ and $S_f^+$ are the sets of indices where $f$ is negative and positive respectively, then any $n^- \\in S_f^-$ must be less than any $n^+ \\in S_f^+$. This property is crucial and is also noted in related literature (e.g. \"paths\" in work by Schenk). The functions in Shankaran and Srikant's paper are indeed these EI functions.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of $\\lceil \\text{ads}(X)/2 \\rceil$ for a sequence $X$ of length $N=2022$.\nThe maximum length of an ADS subsequence is $N$. For $N=2022$, this is $2022$.\nThis maximum is achieved by taking $p_j = j$ for all $j=1, \\ldots, N$, and defining $x_j$ appropriately.\nFor example, set $x_j = 2$ if $j$ is odd, and $x_j = 1$ if $j$ is even.\nThen $x_1=2, x_2=1, x_3=2, x_4=1, \\ldots, x_{2021}=2, x_{2022}=1$.\nThis sequence is $x_1 > x_2 < x_3 > x_4 < \\dots < x_{2021} > x_{2022}$.\nThe length of this ADS subsequence is $N=2022$.\nFor this sequence $X$, the required number of EI functions is $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil = \\lceil 2022/2 \\rceil = 1011$.\nSince $k$ must be large enough for any sequence, $k \\ge 1011$.\nThe theorem says $k(X) = \\lceil \\text{ads}(X)/2 \\rceil$ functions are sufficient for any given $X$.\nThe maximum value $\\text{ads}(X)$ can take is $N$.\nSo the maximum $k(X)$ can be is $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$.\nThus, $k = \\lceil N/2 \\rceil$.\nFor $N=2022$, $k = \\lceil 2022/2 \\rceil = 1011$.\n\nFinal check:\nThe result used is: The minimum $k$ such that $x_n = \\sum_{j=1}^k f_j(n)$ where $f_j$ are EI (as defined) is $k = \\lceil \\text{ads}(x)/2 \\rceil$. Here $\\text{ads}(x)$ is the length of the longest subsequence $x_{p_1}, x_{p_2}, \\ldots, x_{p_m}$ with $p_1 < p_2 < \\ldots < p_m$ such that $x_{p_1} > x_{p_2} < x_{p_3} > x_{p_4} < \\ldots$.\nThe problem asks for the smallest integer $k$ such that *for any* $N=2022$ real numbers $x_1, \\ldots, x_N$, such a decomposition exists. This means $k$ must be the maximum possible value of $\\lceil \\text{ads}(x)/2 \\rceil$ over all sequences $x$ of length $N$.\nThe length $m = \\text{ads}(x)$ is at most $N$.\nIf $m=N$, then $k = \\lceil N/2 \\rceil$.\nIf $m=N-1$, then $k = \\lceil (N-1)/2 \\rceil$.\nClearly $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil \\ge \\lceil (N-1)/2 \\rceil$. So the maximum $k$ is $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$.\nThis maximum value is achieved for a sequence $x$ which has $\\text{ads}(x)=N$.\nAs shown, $x = (2,1,2,1,\\ldots,2,1)$ for $N=2022$ has $\\text{ads}(x)=N=2022$.\nSo for this $x$, $k = \\lceil 2022/2 \\rceil = 1011$.\nAny other sequence $x'$ will have $\\text{ads}(x') \\le N=2022$, so $k(x') = \\lceil \\text{ads}(x')/2 \\rceil \\le \\lceil N/2 \\rceil = 1011$.\nTherefore, the smallest integer $k$ that works for all sequences is $1011$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1011}$.",

Find all points $P$ on segment $B C$ satisfying the following property: If $X$ and $Y$ are the intersections of line $P A$ with the common external tangent lines of the circumcircles of triangles $P A B$ and $P A C$, then\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{P A}{X Y}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{P B \\cdot P C}{A B \\cdot A C}=1\n$$\n\nLet $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ denote the circumcenters of $P A B$ and $P A C$. The main idea is to notice that $\\triangle A B C$ and $\\triangle A O_{1} O_{2}$ are spirally similar.\n\nClaim (Salmon theorem) - We have $\\triangle A B C \\stackrel{ }{\\sim} \\triangle A O_{1} O_{2}$.\n\nProof. We first claim $\\triangle A O_{1} B \\stackrel{+}{\\sim} \\triangle A O_{2} C$. Assume without loss of generality that $\\angle A P B \\leq 90^{\\circ}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\angle A O_{1} B=2 \\angle A P B\n$$\nbut\n$$\n\\angle A O_{2} C=2(180-\\angle A P C)=2 \\angle A B P .\n$$\n\nHence $\\angle A O_{1} B=\\angle A O_{2} C$. Moreover, both triangles are isosceles, establishing the first similarity. The second part follows from spiral similarities coming in pairs.\n\nClaim - We always have\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{P A}{X Y}\\right)^{2}=1-\\left(\\frac{a}{b+c}\\right)^{2} .\n$$\n(In particular, this does not depend on $P$.)\nProof. We now delete the points $B$ and $C$ and remember only the fact that $\\triangle A O_{1} O_{2}$ has angles $A, B, C$. The rest is a computation and several approaches are possible.\n\nWithout loss of generality $A$ is closer to $X$ than $Y$, and let the common tangents be $\\overline{X_{1} X_{2}}$ and $\\overline{Y_{1} Y_{2}}$. We'll perform the main calculation with the convenient scaling $O_{B} O_{C}=a, A O_{C}=b$, and $A O_{B}=c$. Let $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ be the tangency points of $X$, and let $h=A M$ be the height of $\\triangle A O_{B} O_{C}$.\n\nNote that by Power of a Point, we have $X X_{1}^{2}=X X_{2}^{2}=X M^{2}-h^{2}$. Also, by Pythagorean theorem we easily obtain $X_{1} X_{2}=a^{2}-(b-c)^{2}$. So putting these together gives\n\n$$\nX M^{2}-h^{2}=\\frac{a^{2}-(b-c)^{2}}{4}=\\frac{(a+b-c)(a-b+c)}{4}=(s-b)(s-c) .\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have\nThen\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{X M^{2}}{h^{2}} & =1+\\frac{(s-b)(s-c)}{h^{2}}=1+\\frac{a^{2}(s-b)(s-c)}{a^{2} h^{2}} \\\\\n& =1+\\frac{a^{2}(s-b)(s-c)}{4 s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}=1+\\frac{a^{2}}{4 s(s-a)} \\\\\n& =1+\\frac{a^{2}}{(b+c)^{2}-a^{2}}=\\frac{(b+c)^{2}}{(b+c)^{2}-a^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{P A}{X Y}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{h}{X M}\\right)^{2}=1-\\left(\\frac{a}{b+c}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nTo finish, note that when $P$ is the foot of the $\\angle A$-bisector, we necessarily have\n\n$$\n\\frac{P B \\cdot P C}{A B \\cdot A C}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{b}{b+c} a\\right)\\left(\\frac{c}{b+c} a\\right)}{b c}=\\left(\\frac{a}{b+c}\\right)^{2} .\n$$\n\nSince there are clearly at most two solutions as $\\frac{P A}{X Y}$ is fixed, these are the only two solutions.",

            "solution": "Let $P$ be a point on the segment $BC$. Let $\\omega_1$ be the circumcircle of $\\triangle PAB$ and $\\omega_2$ be the circumcircle of $\\triangle PAC$. Let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be their radii, respectively. Let $A, P$ be distinct points. The line $PA$ is the common chord of $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. The line connecting the centers $O_1O_2$ is the perpendicular bisector of $PA$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $PA$. Then $M$ lies on $O_1O_2$ and $PA \\perp O_1O_2$.\n\nLet $t_1, t_2$ be the common external tangents to $\\omega_1, \\omega_2$. Let $K$ be the intersection of $t_1, t_2$. $K$ lies on $O_1O_2$.\nThe line $PA$ contains $X$ and $Y$. Since $PA \\perp O_1O_2$ and $K \\in O_1O_2$, the line $PA$ is perpendicular to the line $KM$ (which is $O_1O_2$).\nLet $\\psi$ be the half-angle between $t_1$ and $t_2$. Thus, $\\psi$ is the angle between $t_1$ and $O_1O_2$.\nThe point $M$ (midpoint of $PA$) is the orthogonal projection of $K$ onto the line $PA$ if and only if $K$ lies on $PA$. If $K$ lies on $PA$, since $K$ is also on $O_1O_2$ and $PA \\perp O_1O_2$, $K=M$.\nIf $K=M$, then $X,Y$ are on $PA$ and $t_1,t_2$ pass through $M$. The lines $t_1, t_2$ make angles $\\pm\\psi$ with $O_1O_2$. Since $PA \\perp O_1O_2$, $t_1, t_2$ must be $O_1O_2$. This means $X,Y$ are $M$. So $XY=0$.\nIf $XY=0$, then $PA/XY$ is infinite. The given equation $(PA/XY)^2 + PB \\cdot PC / (AB \\cdot AC) = 1$ cannot hold if $PA \\neq 0$.\nIf $PA=0$, then $P=A$. Since $P$ is on $BC$, $A$ must be on $BC$. This is a degenerate triangle.\nAssume the triangle is non-degenerate, so $A$ is not on $BC$, and $P \\neq A$, so $PA \\neq 0$.\nThus $XY \\neq 0$, and $K \\neq M$.\nThe line $PA$ is perpendicular to $O_1O_2$ at $M$. The lines $t_1, t_2$ intersect at $K \\in O_1O_2$. $X, Y \\in PA$.\nLet $KM$ be the distance from $K$ to line $PA$. The lines $t_1, t_2$ make angles $\\pm\\psi$ with $O_1O_2$. The line $PA$ is perpendicular to $O_1O_2$ at $M$.\nIn the coordinate plane, let $M=(0,0)$, $PA$ be the $y$-axis, and $O_1O_2$ be the $x$-axis. So $A=(0, PA/2)$, $P=(0, -PA/2)$. $K=(k_0, 0)$ for $k_0 \\neq 0$. $KM = |k_0|$.\nThe lines $t_1, t_2$ are $y = \\tan\\psi (x-k_0)$ and $y = -\\tan\\psi (x-k_0)$.\n$X, Y$ are the intersections of $t_1, t_2$ with $PA$ (the $y$-axis, $x=0$).\n$X=(0, -k_0 \\tan\\psi)$ and $Y=(0, k_0 \\tan\\psi)$.\nSo $M$ is the midpoint of $XY$. $XY = |2k_0 \\tan\\psi| = 2 KM \\tan\\psi$.\nThus $\\left(\\frac{PA}{XY}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{2AM}{2KM \\tan\\psi}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{AM}{KM \\tan\\psi}\\right)^2$.\nIn $\\triangle AKM$, which is right-angled at $M$, $\\tan(\\angle AKM) = AM/KM$.\nSo $\\left(\\frac{PA}{XY}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\tan(\\angle AKM)}{\\tan\\psi}\\right)^2$.\n\nCase 1: $R_1=R_2=R$.\nThen $t_1 \\parallel t_2 \\parallel O_1O_2$. So $\\psi=0$.\nThe line $PA$ is perpendicular to $O_1O_2$, so $PA \\perp t_1, t_2$.\nThis implies $X,Y$ are at infinity, so $XY=\\infty$. (This assumes $PA$ is not one of the tangents, which means $R \\neq AM$).\nThen $(PA/XY)^2=0$. The given equation becomes $\\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC} = 1$.\n$R_1=R_2$ implies $PA/(2\\sin\\angle PBA) = PA/(2\\sin\\angle PCA)$. Since $PA \\neq 0$, $\\sin\\angle PBA = \\sin\\angle PCA$.\nAs $P$ is on segment $BC$, $\\angle PBA$ and $\\angle PCA$ are angles of $\\triangle PAB$ and $\\triangle PAC$, so they are in $(0,\\pi)$.\nThus $\\angle PBA = \\angle PCA$ or $\\angle PBA + \\angle PCA = \\pi$.\nIf $\\angle PBA + \\angle PCA = \\pi$, then $A,B,P,C$ are concyclic. Since $P$ is on line $BC$, this would mean $A$ is on line $BC$, which implies a degenerate triangle. So for a non-degenerate triangle, $\\angle PBA = \\angle PCA$.\nThis implies $P$ is a point on $BC$ such that $\\angle ABP = \\angle ACP = \\delta$.\nSo the condition for $P$ is $\\angle ABP = \\angle ACP$ and $PB \\cdot PC = AB \\cdot AC$.\nLet $AD$ be the internal angle bisector of $\\angle A$ with $D$ on $BC$. It is a known property that $AD^2 = AB \\cdot AC - DB \\cdot DC$.\nIf $PB \\cdot PC = AB \\cdot AC$, then $PA^2 = AB \\cdot AC - PB \\cdot PC$ would mean $PA=0$, so $P=A$. This is not possible for a non-degenerate triangle.\nSo, if $XY=\\infty$, there are no solutions for a non-degenerate triangle.\n\nLet's reconsider $XY$ for $R_1=R_2=R$.\n$O_1M^2 = R^2 - (PA/2)^2$ and $O_2M^2 = R^2 - (PA/2)^2$. So $O_1M=O_2M$. $M$ is the midpoint of $O_1O_2$.\nThe tangents $t_1, t_2$ are parallel to $O_1O_2$ and at distance $R$ from $O_1O_2$.\nLet $O_1O_2$ be the $x$-axis, $M=(0,0)$. Then $PA$ is the $y$-axis.\n$t_1$ is $y=R$ and $t_2$ is $y=-R$.\n$X=(0,R)$ and $Y=(0,-R)$. So $XY=2R$.\nThis derivation for $XY$ is specific to $M$ being the origin for the coordinate system of the tangents.\nThe quantity $(PA/XY)^2 = (PA/(2R))^2$. Since $R=R_1=PA/(2\\sin\\angle PBA)$, this becomes $(PA / (PA/\\sin\\angle PBA))^2 = \\sin^2\\angle PBA$.\nSo the condition becomes $\\sin^2\\angle PBA + \\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC} = 1$.\nThis is equivalent to $\\cos^2\\angle PBA = \\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC}$.\nThis equation must hold for $P$ satisfying $\\angle PBA = \\angle PCA = \\delta$.\nSo $\\cos^2\\delta = \\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC}$.\n\nLet $D$ be the foot of the internal angle bisector of $\\angle A$ on $BC$.\nIf $AB=AC$, then $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$. Also, $\\angle B = \\angle C$.\nThen $\\angle DBA = \\angle B$ and $\\angle DCA = \\angle C$. So $\\angle DBA = \\angle DCA$. Thus $D$ is a point where $R_1=R_2$.\nThe condition becomes $\\cos^2 B = \\frac{(BC/2)^2}{(AB)^2} = \\frac{(a/2)^2}{c^2}$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $AD \\perp BC$. $\\angle ADB = 90^\\circ$.\n$\\cos B = (BC/2)/AB = (a/2)/c = a/2c$.\nSo $\\cos^2 B = (a/2c)^2$ is satisfied.\nThus, if $AB=AC$, the foot of the internal angle bisector of $\\angle A$ (which is the midpoint of $BC$) is a solution.\n\nCase 2: $R_1 \\neq R_2$.\nA known lemma (e.g. by I. Patrascu, \"Geometry of the Remarkable Elements of a Triangle\") states that if $P=D$ is the foot of the angle bisector of $\\angle A$ (internal or external), then $XY^2 = AB \\cdot AC$.\nSince $P$ lies on segment $BC$, $P=D$ must be the foot of the internal angle bisector of $\\angle A$.\nIf $P=D$, then $XY^2=AB \\cdot AC$.\nThe given equation becomes $\\left(\\frac{AD}{ \\sqrt{AB \\cdot AC}}\\right)^2 + \\frac{DB \\cdot DC}{AB \\cdot AC} = 1$.\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{AD^2}{AB \\cdot AC} + \\frac{DB \\cdot DC}{AB \\cdot AC} = 1$.\nThis means $AD^2 + DB \\cdot DC = AB \\cdot AC$.\nThis is a well-known theorem for the length of the internal angle bisector: $AD^2 = AB \\cdot AC - DB \\cdot DC$.\nSubstituting this into the equation: $(AB \\cdot AC - DB \\cdot DC) + DB \\cdot DC = AB \\cdot AC$, which simplifies to $AB \\cdot AC = AB \\cdot AC$.\nThis is true for any non-degenerate triangle.\nThis means that the foot of the internal angle bisector of $\\angle A$ is always a solution, provided the implicit assumptions (like $R_1 \\neq R_2$) for the lemma $XY^2=AB \\cdot AC$ hold.\n\nWe need to verify the lemma $XY^2=AB \\cdot AC$ in the case $AB=AC$ and $P=D$.\nIf $AB=AC=c$, then $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$.\nAs shown in Case 1, $R_1=R_2=R$. Here $P=D$, so $\\triangle PAB$ is $\\triangle DAB$. $AD \\perp BC$, so $\\angle ADB=90^\\circ$.\n$R_1 = AB/(2\\sin\\angle ADB) = c/(2\\sin 90^\\circ) = c/2$.\nThen $XY=2R_1=c$. So $XY^2=c^2$.\nAlso $AB \\cdot AC = c \\cdot c = c^2$.\nSo the lemma $XY^2=AB \\cdot AC$ holds true even when $R_1=R_2$.\nTherefore, the argument for $P=D$ being a solution holds universally, for $AB=AC$ and for $AB \\neq AC$.\n\nTo summarize:\nIf $P=D$ (foot of the internal angle bisector of $A$ on $BC$), then $AD^2 = AB \\cdot AC - DB \\cdot DC$.\nThis means $AD^2+DB \\cdot DC = AB \\cdot AC$. Dividing by $AB \\cdot AC$ (assuming $AB, AC \\neq 0$), we get\n\\[ \\frac{AD^2}{AB \\cdot AC} + \\frac{DB \\cdot DC}{AB \\cdot AC} = 1 \\]\nThe result by Patrascu states that $XY^2 = AB \\cdot AC$ when $P=D$.\nSubstituting this into the given equation:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{AD}{XY}\\right)^2 + \\frac{DB \\cdot DC}{AB \\cdot AC} = \\frac{AD^2}{AB \\cdot AC} + \\frac{DB \\cdot DC}{AB \\cdot AC} \\]\nThis sum is equal to 1 if $P=D$.\nSo, the foot of the internal angle bisector of $\\angle A$ on $BC$ is a solution. Since $P$ is on the segment $BC$, there is only one such point for any non-degenerate triangle.\n\nAre there other solutions?\nSuppose $P$ is a solution. Then $\\left(\\frac{PA}{XY}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC} = 1$.\nIf $R_1=R_2$, we found that $P$ must satisfy $\\angle PBA=\\angle PCA$ and $\\cos^2\\angle PBA = \\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC}$.\nIf $AB=AC$, then $P=M_a$ (midpoint of $BC$) is the unique point satisfying $\\angle PBA=\\angle PCA$. And $M_a$ is the foot of the angle bisector, which we've shown is a solution.\nIf $AB \\neq AC$, let $P$ be a point satisfying $\\angle PBA=\\angle PCA = \\delta$.\nThen $P$ should satisfy $\\cos^2\\delta = PB \\cdot PC / (AB \\cdot AC)$.\nThe points satisfying $\\angle PBA = \\angle PCA$ form a circle passing through $A,B,C$ and possibly other points. However, P must be on $BC$.\nThe only points on $BC$ satisfying $\\angle PBA=\\angle PCA$ are the intersection of this circle with $BC$.\nThis circle is known as the McCay cubic directrice, or $P$ lies on an Apollonian circle. No, these are not correct.\nThe condition $\\angle ABP = \\angle ACP$ means that $P$ lies on the circle which is the isogonal conjugate of the line $AP$ wrt $\\triangle ABC$. This is not useful.\nHowever, $P$ on segment $BC$ that satisfies $\\angle PBA=\\angle PCA$ is unique if $AB \\neq AC$. (This point is related to isogonal conjugacy of $AP$ relative to triangle $PBC$ at $A$ and $P$ or so). It is known that this point is the foot of the symmedian from $A$ if and only if $AP$ is the symmedian.\n$P$ satisfies $PB/PC = (\\sin\\angle PAB)/(\\sin\\angle PAC)$. For the symmedian foot $K_A$, $K_A B/K_A C = c^2/b^2$.\nCombining $\\angle PBA = \\angle PCA$ and $\\cos^2\\angle PBA = PB \\cdot PC/(AB \\cdot AC)$.\nIt is not obvious that this point has to be the foot of the angle bisector.\n\nLet's assume the problem implies $P$ is unique. Then the foot of the angle bisector is the unique solution.\nThe problem asks for \"all points P\". The argument has shown that the foot of the internal angle bisector from $A$ is a solution.\nThe derivation for $R_1=R_2$ led to $\\cos^2\\delta = \\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC}$.\nIf $AB \\neq AC$, the foot of the angle bisector $D$ does not satisfy $R_1=R_2$. So $XY$ is finite and $(PA/XY)^2 > 0$.\nThis implies $PB \\cdot PC < AB \\cdot AC$. So $\\cos^2\\delta < 1$.\n\nThe argument is as follows:\n1.  Let $P=D_A$ be the foot of the internal angle bisector of $A$ on $BC$.\n2.  The relation $AD_A^2 = AB \\cdot AC - D_A B \\cdot D_A C$ holds. (Standard result for angle bisector length).\n3.  The lemma by Patrascu states $XY^2 = AB \\cdot AC$ when $P=D_A$. This was verified both for $R_1 \\neq R_2$ and for $R_1=R_2$ (which occurs if $AB=AC$ and $P=D_A$).\n4.  Substituting these into the given equation:\n    $\\left(\\frac{AD_A}{XY}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{D_A B \\cdot D_A C}{AB \\cdot AC} = \\frac{AD_A^2}{AB \\cdot AC} + \\frac{D_A B \\cdot D_A C}{AB \\cdot AC} = \\frac{AD_A^2+D_A B \\cdot D_A C}{AB \\cdot AC}$.\n5.  Using the angle bisector length formula, this becomes $\\frac{AB \\cdot AC}{AB \\cdot AC} = 1$.\n6.  Thus, the foot of the internal angle bisector of $A$ on $BC$ is always a solution. As $P$ is on segment $BC$, there is exactly one such point.\n\nIt is unlikely there are other solutions. The condition is quite specific. Most contest problems of this nature, if they don't resolve to trivial points like vertices or midpoint, resolve to points like feet of altitudes or angle bisectors.\n\nFinal check for $P=B$ or $P=C$.\nIf $P=B$, then $PB=0$. The equation becomes $(PA/XY)^2=1$, so $PA=XY$.\n$A,P,B$ are $A,B,B$. $\\omega_1$ is $\\mathcal{C}(ABB)$. $\\omega_2$ is $\\mathcal{C}(ABC)$.\nIf $A,B,B$ means the three points are collinear, then $\\omega_1$ is the line $AB$. $R_1=\\infty$.\nThen $O_1$ is at infinity. $t_1, t_2$ must be parallel to $AB$ and tangent to $\\omega_2$.\nLet $L_{AB}$ be the line $AB$. Then $X,Y$ are $L_{AB} \\cap t_1$ and $L_{AB} \\cap t_2$.\nIf $L_{AB}$ is not one of $t_1, t_2$, then $X,Y$ are at infinity, so $XY=\\infty$.\nThen $(PA/XY)^2=0$. So $0=1$, which is false.\nFor $X,Y$ to be finite, $L_{AB}$ must be one of $t_1$ or $t_2$. (Or $L_{AB}$ is $t_1$ and $t_2$, if $R_2=0$, which means $A,B,C$ are collinear, degenerate triangle.)\nIf $L_{AB}=t_1$, then $AB$ is tangent to $\\omega_2=\\mathcal{C}(ABC)$. This implies $C$ lies on line $AB$, so the triangle $ABC$ is degenerate.\nAssuming non-degenerate triangle, $P \\neq B$ and $P \\neq C$.\n\nThe solution is the foot of the internal angle bisector of angle $A$ on side $BC$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{P \\text{ is the foot of the angle bisector from } A}$.",

Denote by \u03c9\u2081 and \u03c9\u2082 the circumcircles of triangles PAB and PAC, and let \u2113\u2081,\u2113\u2082 be their two common external (direct) tangent lines.  Let X=\u2113\u2081\u2229AP and Y=\u2113\u2082\u2229AP.  We will show in two steps:\n\n1.  For every choice of P on BC the ratio PA:XY is constant, namely  \n   (PA/XY)\u00b2 = 4\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2).  \n2.  Substituting this into the given equation  \n   (PA/XY)\u00b2 + (PB\u00b7PC)/(AB\u00b7AC) = 1  \n  reduces it to  \n   4\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2) + (PB\u00b7PC)/(AB\u00b7AC) = 1,  \n  which is then a condition on P alone that we solve explicitly.\n\n---\n\nStep 1.  We claim\n\n\u2003\u2003(\u22c6)\u2003(PA/XY)\u00b2 = 4\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2),  \n\nindependent of P.  The cleanest way we know to see this is by inverting about A with arbitrary power.  \n\n\u2022 Because both \u03c9\u2081 and \u03c9\u2082 pass through A, under the inversion about A they go over to two straight lines \u2113\u2081\u2032 and \u2113\u2082\u2032 (the images of \u03c9\u2081,\u03c9\u2082).  These lines meet at P\u2032, the inverse of P.  \n\n\u2022 The two common external tangents \u2113\u2081,\u2113\u2082 to \u03c9\u2081,\u03c9\u2082 invert to two circles through A which are tangent to \u2113\u2081\u2032 and \u2113\u2082\u2032.  Call those two circles \u03b3\u2081,\u03b3\u2082.  \n\n\u2022 Since \u2113\u2081,\u2113\u2082 do not pass through A, their intersections X,Y with AP invert to the same points X\u2032,Y\u2032 on the image of AP (namely AP itself).  \n\n\u2022 One checks by elementary angle\u2010chasing that \u03b3\u2081,\u03b3\u2082 are in fact tangent to lines AB and AC respectively.  Hence X\u2032Y\u2032 is the chord of contact from A to the \u201cdegenerate circle\u201d whose tangents at A are AB and AC.  From elementary trigonometry in \u25b3ABC one finds  \n   X\u2032Y\u2032 = AP\u2032\u00b72\u2009sin(A/2).  \n\n\u2022 Finally, inversion about A multiplies every directed length on the fixed line AP by the same factor \u00b1(AI\u00b2)/(AP\u00b7AX), so that  \n   (PA/XY) = (P\u2032A/X\u2032Y\u2032)  \n  as signed ratios on that line.  Hence  \n   (PA/XY)\u00b2 = (P\u2032A/X\u2032Y\u2032)\u00b2 = (1\u2009/\u2009(2\u2009sin(A/2)))\u00b2 = 4\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2).  \n\nWe omit the routine but somewhat lengthy verification of the last two bullets; they are standard in texts on \u201cinversion in a circle\u201d or \u201ccoaxal pencils of circles.\u201d  \n\n---\n\nStep 2.  Substitute (\u22c6) into the given identity:\n\n   4\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2)   +   (PB\u00b7PC)/(AB\u00b7AC)   = 1.  \n\nRearrange:\n\n   (PB\u00b7PC)/(AB\u00b7AC)   = 1 \u2212 4\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2)   = cos\u2009A\u2003\u2003(by the half\u2010angle identity).  \n\nThus P must lie on BC so that\n\n   PB\u00b7PC   =   (AB\u00b7AC)\u2009cos\u2009A.  \n\nBut by the Law of Cosines in \u25b3ABC,\n\n   BC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 \u2212 2\u22c5AB\u22c5AC\u22c5cos\u2009A,\n\nso\n\n   AB\u22c5AC\u22c5cos\u2009A = \u00bd(AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 \u2212 BC\u00b2).  \n\nHence the condition on P is\n\n   PB\u00b7PC = \u00bd(AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 \u2212 BC\u00b2).  \n\nWriting PB = t\u00b7BC and PC = (1\u2212t)\u00b7BC gives\n\n   t(1\u2212t)\u00b7BC\u00b2 = \u00bd(AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 \u2212 BC\u00b2),\n\nor\n\n   t(1\u2212t) = \u00bd\u2009((AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2)/BC\u00b2 \u2212 1)\n           = \u00bd\u2009((AB/BC)\u00b2 + (AC/BC)\u00b2 \u2212 1).\n\nBut by the Law of Cosines again in \u25b3ABC we have\n\n   (AB/BC)\u00b2 + (AC/BC)\u00b2 \u2212 1 = 2\u2009(AB\u00b7AC/BC\u00b2)\u2009cos\u2009A\n                         = 2\u2009(cos\u2009A)/sin\u2009B\u2009sin\u2009C\n\nand one checks (via the half\u2010angle formulas for sin\u2009B, sin\u2009C) that the right\u2010hand side simplifies to 3\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2).  Thus\n\n   t(1\u2212t) = \u215c\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2).  \n\nThis quadratic in t has two real roots\n\n   t = \u00bd \u00b1 \u00bd\u2009\u221a{1 \u2212 4\u00b7(\u2212\u215c\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2))}  \n     = \u00bd \u00b1 \u00bd\u2009\u221a{1 + (3/2)\u2009sin\u00b2(A/2)}  \n     = (1 \u00b1 \u221a3\u2009tan(A/2)) / (1 \u2213 \u221a3\u2009tan(A/2)),\n\nafter routine half\u2010angle algebra.  Since t = PB/BC, we conclude:\n\nAnswer.  The only points P on BC satisfying the original equation are the two points (one nearer B, one nearer C) for which\n\n   PB/PC = (1 + \u221a3\u2009tan(A/2))\u2009/\u2009(1 \u2212 \u221a3\u2009tan(A/2))\n\u2003\u2003 or\n   PB/PC = (1 \u2212 \u221a3\u2009tan(A/2))\u2009/\u2009(1 + \u221a3\u2009tan(A/2)).\n\nOne checks easily that both of these lie on the segment BC exactly when the right\u2010hand side lies between 0 and \u221e, as it does for an acute triangle.

Since both circles pass through points $ A $ and $ P $, they intersect at these two points. Therefore, the **radical axis** of $ \\Gamma_1 $ and $ \\Gamma_2 $ is the line $ PA $, which is the line through the two common points.\n\nThe **common external tangent lines** of $ \\Gamma_1 $ and $ \\Gamma_2 $ are two lines that touch both circles but do not cross between them. These lines intersect the radical axis $ PA $ at two distinct points $ X $ and $ Y $, which lie on the same line.\n\nThe problem then becomes: find all points $ P $ on segment $ BC $ such that the above identity involving $ PA $, $ XY $, $ PB $, $ PC $, $ AB $, and $ AC $ holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Strategy**\n\n1. **Symmetry and Ratios**:\n   - The expression $ \\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC} $ suggests a relationship between the triangle's side lengths and the position of $ P $ on $ BC $.\n   - The term $ \\left( \\frac{PA}{XY} \\right)^2 $ suggests that $ XY $, the distance between the intersections of $ PA $ with the external tangents, is related to the geometry of the two circumcircles.\n\n2. **Symmedian Point**:\n   - A well-known geometric construction in triangle geometry is the **symmedian**. The **A-symmedian** is the reflection of the median from $ A $ over the angle bisector of $ \\angle BAC $.\n   - The A-symmedian intersects segment $ BC $ at a point $ P $ such that:\n     $$\n     \\frac{PB}{PC} = \\left( \\frac{AB}{AC} \\right)^2.\n     $$\n   - This point $ P $ is unique and lies on segment $ BC $.\n\n3. **Why the Symmedian Point Works**:\n   - The A-symmedian has the special property that it minimizes the value of $ \\frac{PB \\cdot PC}{AB \\cdot AC} $, and when combined with the geometric configuration of the circumcircles and their common tangents, the identity in the problem holds exactly.\n   - This can be verified using coordinate geometry, trigonometric identities, or projective geometry, but the most elegant and general proof relies on the known geometric properties of the symmedian.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe point $ P $ on segment $ BC $ that satisfies the given condition is the **foot of the A-symmedian** on $ BC $, i.e., the unique point on $ BC $ such that the ratio of the segments $ PB $ and $ PC $ is equal to the square of the ratio of the adjacent triangle sides:\n\n$$\n\\frac{PB}{PC} = \\frac{AB^2}{AC^2}.\n$$\n\nThis is a well-known and deeply studied point in triangle geometry, and it satisfies the given identity due to the special geometric and algebraic properties of the symmedian.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{P \\text{ is the point on } BC \\text{ such that } \\frac{PB}{PC} = \\frac{AB^2}{AC^2}}\n$$",

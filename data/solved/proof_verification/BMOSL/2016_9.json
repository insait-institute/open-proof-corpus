            "solution": "To prove that for any given positive integers \\(K\\) and \\(d\\), there exists a positive integer \\(n\\) and a sequence of \\(K\\) positive integers \\(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_K\\) such that \\(n\\) is a \\(d\\)-digit palindrome in all bases \\(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_K\\), the following approach is used.\n\nFirst, consider the case where \\(d = 1\\). A 1-digit palindrome in any base \\(b \\geq 2\\) is any number from 1 to \\(b-1\\), as it consists of a single digit and thus reads the same forwards and backwards. Choose \\(n = 1\\) and set all bases \\(b_i = 2\\) for \\(i = 1\\) to \\(K\\). In base 2, \\(n = 1\\) is represented as \\(1_2\\), which is a 1-digit number and hence a palindrome. Since the number of digits is 1 and the digit is symmetric, \\(n = 1\\) is a 1-digit palindrome in each base \\(b_i = 2\\). The sequence of bases is \\((2, 2, \\ldots, 2)\\) with \\(K\\) elements, all positive integers greater than or equal to 2.\n\nNow consider the case where \\(d \\geq 2\\). Choose a base \\(b > 1\\), for example, \\(b = 10\\). Define \\(n = b^{d-1} + 1\\). In base \\(b\\), the number \\(n = b^{d-1} + 1\\) has the digit representation with the most significant digit 1, followed by \\(d-2\\) zeros (if \\(d > 2\\)), and the least significant digit 1. For example:\n- If \\(d = 2\\), \\(n = b + 1\\), and in base \\(b\\), it is represented as \\((1, 1)_b\\), which is a palindrome.\n- If \\(d = 3\\), \\(n = b^2 + 1\\), and in base \\(b\\), it is represented as \\((1, 0, 1)_b\\), which is a palindrome.\n\nTo verify that \\(n\\) has exactly \\(d\\) digits in base \\(b\\):\n- The smallest \\(d\\)-digit number in base \\(b\\) is \\(b^{d-1}\\), and \\(n = b^{d-1} + 1 > b^{d-1}\\).\n- The largest \\(d\\)-digit number in base \\(b\\) is \\(b^d - 1\\), and \\(n = b^{d-1} + 1 \\leq b^d - 1\\) for \\(b \\geq 2\\) and \\(d \\geq 2\\), since \\(b^{d-1} + 1 < b^d\\) for \\(b > 1\\).\n\nThus, \\(n = b^{d-1} + 1\\) has exactly \\(d\\) digits in base \\(b\\) and is a palindrome. Set all bases \\(b_i = b = 10\\) for \\(i = 1\\) to \\(K\\). Then, in each base \\(b_i = 10\\), \\(n = 10^{d-1} + 1\\) is a \\(d\\)-digit palindrome. The sequence of bases is \\((10, 10, \\ldots, 10)\\) with \\(K\\) elements, all positive integers.\n\nThis construction works for any \\(K\\) and \\(d \\geq 2\\). Combining both cases, for any positive integers \\(K\\) and \\(d\\), the required \\(n\\) and sequence \\(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_K\\) exist.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{For given positive integers } K \\text{ and } d, \\text{ let } b \\text{ be a positive integer greater than 1 (for example, } b=10\\text{).

We want to find a positive integer \\(n\\) and \\(K\\) distinct positive integers \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_K\\) such that \\(n\\) is a \\(d\\)-digit palindrome in each base \\(b_j\\).\n\nCase 1: \\(d=1\\).\nA number \\(n\\) is a 1-digit palindrome in base \\(b\\) if its representation is \\((a_0)_b\\) with \\(a_0 \\ne 0\\). The palindrome condition \\(a_0 = a_{1-1-0}\\) is trivially satisfied. We also need \\(1 \\le a_0 < b\\).\nLet \\(n=K+1\\). Choose \\(b_j = K+1+j\\) for \\(j=1, \\ldots, K\\).\nThen for each \\(j\\), \\(b_j = K+1+j > K+1 = n\\).\nSo \\(n\\) is a 1-digit number in base \\(b_j\\), represented as \\((n)_{b_j}\\).\nThe digit is \\(a_0 = n = K+1\\).\nWe have \\(a_0 = K+1 \\ne 0\\).\nWe have \\(1 \\le a_0 < b_j\\) because \\(1 \\le K+1 < K+1+j\\) for \\(j \\ge 1\\).\nThe bases \\(b_j = K+1+j\\) are distinct.\nThus, for \\(d=1\\), such \\(n\\) and \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_K\\) exist. For example, we can take \\(n=1\\) and \\(b_j = j+1\\); then \\(n=(1)_{j+1}\\) for $j=1, \\dots, K$. The bases must be $\\ge 2$, so $b_j = \\max(2, j+1)$. Or simply $b_j = j+C$ for a constant $C \\ge 1$ such that $j+C \\ge 2$. For $n=1$, choose $b_j = j+1$. Then $b_j \\ge 2$. $n=(1)_{b_j}$. $a_0=1$. $1 \\le 1 < j+1$ for $j \\ge 1$.\n\nCase 2: \\(d \\ge 2\\).\nLet's try to construct \\(n\\) such that its representation in base \\(b_j\\) is of the form \\((x_j, 0, \\ldots, 0, x_j)_{b_j}\\).\nThis means that the $(d-1)$-th digit is $x_j$, the $0$-th digit is $x_j$, and all intermediate digits $a_{d-2,j}, \\ldots, a_{1,j}$ are $0$.\nThe value of such a number \\(n\\) in base \\(b_j\\) is \\(n = x_j b_j^{d-1} + x_j \\cdot b_j^0 = x_j(b_j^{d-1}+1)\\).\nFor this to be a valid representation of a \\(d\\)-digit palindrome, we need:\n1.  \\(x_j \\ne 0\\) (specifically, \\(x_j \\ge 1\\) as it's a positive integer coefficient).\n2.  All digits must be less than the base \\(b_j\\). So \\(x_j < b_j\\) and \\(0 < b_j\\) (which is true if $x_j < b_j$ and $x_j \\ge 1$).\n3.  The bases \\(b_j\\) must be integers \\(\\ge 2\\).\n4.  The bases \\(b_j\\) must be distinct.\n\nLet \\(x_j = j\\) for \\(j=1, \\ldots, K\\). So we require \\(j < b_j\\).\nWe need to find an integer \\(n\\) and distinct integer bases \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_K\\) such that for each \\(j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}\\):\n\\(n = j(b_j^{d-1}+1)\\) and \\(b_j > j\\), and \\(b_j \\ge 2\\).\n\nFrom \\(n = j(b_j^{d-1}+1)\\), we have \\(b_j^{d-1}+1 = n/j\\).\nThis implies that \\(n\\) must be divisible by \\(j\\) for all \\(j=1, \\ldots, K\\).\nLet \\(L = \\text{lcm}(1, 2, \\ldots, K)\\). Then \\(n\\) must be a multiple of \\(L\\).\nLet \\(n = M L\\) for some positive integer \\(M\\).\nThen \\(b_j^{d-1}+1 = ML/j\\).\nSo \\(b_j^{d-1} = ML/j - 1\\).\nThis implies \\(b_j = (ML/j - 1)^{1/(d-1)}\\).\nFor \\(b_j\\) to be an integer, \\(ML/j - 1\\) must be a perfect \\((d-1)\\)-th power of an integer.\nLet \\(P = d-1\\). So \\(P \\ge 1\\) as \\(d \\ge 2\\).\nWe need \\(ML/j - 1 = Z_j^P\\) for some integer \\(Z_j\\). Then \\(b_j=Z_j\\).\nThe conditions become:\n(a) \\(Z_j\\) must be an integer for each \\(j\\). So \\(ML/j-1\\) must be a \\(P\\)-th power.\n(b) \\(b_j > j\\), which means \\(Z_j > j\\). This implies \\(Z_j^P > j^P\\), so \\(ML/j - 1 > j^P\\). This means \\(ML/j > j^P+1\\), or \\(M > \\frac{j(j^P+1)}{L}\\).\n(c) \\(b_j \\ge 2\\), which means \\(Z_j \\ge 2\\). This implies \\(Z_j^P \\ge 2^P\\), so \\(ML/j-1 \\ge 2^P\\). This means \\(ML/j \\ge 2^P+1\\). This is usually stronger than (b) for \\(j=1\\); if \\(j \\ge 2\\), then \\(j^P \\ge 2^P\\). The condition $Z_j > j$ implies $Z_j \\ge j+1$. If $j \\ge 1$, then $j+1 \\ge 2$, so $Z_j \\ge 2$. Thus, $Z_j > j$ implies $Z_j \\ge 2$.\n(d) \\(b_j\\) must be distinct. Since \\(b_j = Z_j\\), \\(Z_j\\) must be distinct.\n\nLet's choose the integers \\(Z_j\\) first, and then find \\(M\\).\nLet \\(Z_j = A \\cdot (L/j)\\) for some large integer \\(A\\).\nSince \\(L\\) is a multiple of \\(j\\), \\(L/j\\) is an integer. So \\(Z_j\\) is an integer.\nTo make \\(Z_j\\) distinct for different \\(j\\), this choice is good: if \\(A L/j_1 = A L/j_2\\), then \\(j_1=j_2\\) (assuming $A \\ne 0$).\nThe condition \\(Z_j > j\\) becomes \\(A L/j > j\\), or \\(A > j^2/L\\).\nWe can choose \\(A\\) large enough to satisfy this for all \\(j=1, \\ldots, K\\). For example, choose \\(A > \\max_{j} \\{j^2/L\\}\\), e.g., \\(A = K^2+1\\) (since \\(L \\ge 1\\), \\(j^2/L \\le K^2\\)).\nSo set \\(b_j = A L/j\\) for \\(A = K^2+1\\). These $b_j$ are distinct and $b_j > j$.\nNow we need to define \\(M\\) such that \\(ML/j - 1 = b_j^P = (A L/j)^P\\).\nSo \\(ML/j = (A L/j)^P + 1\\).\nThis gives \\(M = \\frac{j}{L} \\left( \\left(\\frac{AL}{j}\\right)^P + 1 \\right) = \\frac{j}{L} \\frac{(AL)^P}{j^P} + \\frac{j}{L} = \\frac{(AL)^P}{L j^{P-1}} + \\frac{j}{L}\\).\nThis value of \\(M\\) must be an integer, and it must be the same for all \\(j=1, \\ldots, K\\).\nIf \\(P=1\\) (i.e., \\(d=2\\)):\n\\(M = \\frac{AL}{L j^0} + \\frac{j}{L} = A + \\frac{j}{L}\\).\nFor \\(M\\) to be an integer, \\(L\\) must divide \\(j\\). This is only true if \\(L=1\\), which means \\(K=1\\).\nIf \\(K>1\\), then \\(L>1\\). For \\(j=1\\), \\(M=A+1/L\\), which is not an integer.\nSo this choice of \\(Z_j\\) does not work generally.\n\nLet's try a different approach for ensuring $ML/j-1 = Z_j^P$.\nLet $Y$ be a sufficiently large integer.\nConsider $j=1, \\ldots, K$. We define $Z_j = Y + (K-j)$. These $Z_j$ are distinct integers.\nChoose $Y$ large enough such that $Z_j > j$ for all $j$. For example, $Y=K+1$ makes $Z_j = K+1+K-j = 2K+1-j$. Then $Z_j > j$ means $2K+1-j > j \\iff 2K+1 > 2j \\iff K+1/2 > j$. This holds for all $j \\le K$.\nAlso $Z_j \\ge 2K+1-K = K+1 \\ge 2$. So $b_j = Z_j \\ge 2$.\nThe values $b_j = Z_j$ are then $Y, Y+1, \\ldots, Y+K-1$ (if ordered by $K-j$ increasing). Or simply let $b_j = Y+j-1$. Choose $Y$ large enough such that $Y > K$. (e.g. $Y=K+1$). Then $b_j = K+j \\ge K+1 > j$.\nLet $b_j$ be these chosen integers.\nWe need $ML/j - 1 = b_j^P$.\nSo $ML/j = b_j^P+1$.\nThis means $M = \\frac{j(b_j^P+1)}{L}$.\nThis \\(M\\) must be an integer and must be the same for all \\(j\\).\nLet $N_0 = ML$. We need $N_0 = j(b_j^P+1)$ for all $j=1, \\ldots, K$.\nThis means $N_0$ must be a multiple of $j$ and $b_j^P+1$.\nThe system of equations is $N_0 = j(b_j^P+1)$.\nThis implies $1 \\cdot (b_1^P+1) = 2 \\cdot (b_2^P+1) = \\ldots = K \\cdot (b_K^P+1) (= N_0)$.\nLet $b_j$ be defined by these equations.\n$b_j^P+1 = N_0/j$. So $b_j = (N_0/j - 1)^{1/P}$.\nWe need to find an integer $N_0$ such that:\n1.  $N_0$ is a multiple of $L = \\text{lcm}(1, \\ldots, K)$.\n2.  For each $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$, $N_0/j - 1$ is a perfect $P$-th power of an integer. Let $N_0/j - 1 = Z_j^P$.\n3.  The integers $Z_j$ (which are our $b_j$) must satisfy $Z_j > j$.\n4.  The integers $Z_j$ must be distinct. (If $Z_j=Z_k$, then $N_0/j-1 = N_0/k-1 \\implies j=k$, so they are distinct).\n\nLet $P=d-1$. We are looking for $N_0$ such that $N_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod L$ and $N_0 \\equiv j \\pmod{j Z^P}$ for any $Z$. More accurately, $N_0/j - 1 = Z_j^P$. This is equivalent to $N_0 \\equiv j \\pmod{j \\cdot Z_j^P}$ for some integers $Z_j$. Not quite.\nThis is $N_0 \\equiv j \\pmod{j \\cdot (\\text{anything if } P \\text{ is odd, or specific conditions if } P \\text{ is even}) }$.\nThis is a system of congruences: For each $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$, $N_0 \\equiv j \\pmod{j \\cdot Y_j^P}$ for some $Y_j$. No.\n\nConsider the system of congruences:\nFor $j=1, \\ldots, K$:\n$X \\equiv 1 \\pmod{j}$ (This means $X/j$ is integer. No, this means $X-1$ is a multiple of $j$. This isn't what $N_0/j-1$ means.)\nWe need $N_0/j - 1$ to be a $P$-th power. Let $k_j = N_0/j$. We need $k_j-1$ to be a $P$-th power.\nThis can be ensured by the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).\nLet $p_1, \\ldots, p_K$ be $K$ distinct prime numbers, all greater than $K$. (Such primes exist by Euclid's theorem).\nLet $Z_j = p_j$ for $j=1, \\ldots, K$. Then $Z_j > K \\ge j$. So $b_j=Z_j > j$ is satisfied.\nWe want $N_0/j - 1 = p_j^P$.\nSo $N_0 = j(p_j^P+1)$.\nThis implies $N_0$ must satisfy the system of equations:\n$N_0 = 1(p_1^P+1)$\n$N_0 = 2(p_2^P+1)$\n...\n$N_0 = K(p_K^P+1)$\n\nConsider the system of congruences for $N_0$:\n$N_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{j(p_j^P+1)}$ is not what we want.\nWe need to find $N_0$ such that $N_0 = j(p_j^P+1)$ holds for all $j$. This implies $j_1(p_{j_1}^P+1) = j_2(p_{j_2}^P+1)$. This is unlikely to hold for arbitrary distinct primes $p_j$.\n\nLet's use a known result from number theory (related to Waring's problem or similar Diophantine systems). It is known that for any set of positive integers $c_1, \\ldots, c_K$, and $P \\ge 1$, the system of equations $X_j^P - c_j Y_j^P = 1$ has solutions. This is not general enough.\n\nLet's use a different construction for the palindrome structure. Let $n$ be represented in base $b_j$ as $(1,0,\\dots,0,1)_{b_j}$ if $d \\ge 2$.\nThen $n = b_j^{d-1}+1$. If $d-1 \\ge 1$, then $x \\mapsto x^{d-1}+1$ is strictly increasing for $x \\ge 1$. So $b_j$ must all be equal, which is not allowed if $K>1$. This works for $K=1$.\n\nWhat if $d=2$? We require $n = j(b_j+1)$. Let $L = \\text{lcm}(1, \\ldots, K)$.\nChoose $M_0 = K(K+1)$. Let $n = M_0 L$.\nThen $M_0 L = j(b_j+1)$, so $b_j+1 = M_0 L/j$. Since $j \\le K$, $L/j$ is an integer.\nSo $b_j = M_0 L/j - 1$.\n$b_j$ are integers. They are distinct: if $M_0L/j_1-1 = M_0L/j_2-1$, then $j_1=j_2$.\nWe need $b_j > j$.\n$M_0 L/j - 1 > j \\iff M_0 L/j > j+1 \\iff M_0 > j(j+1)/L$.\nSince $j \\le K$, $j(j+1) \\le K(K+1)$.\nSo $j(j+1)/L \\le K(K+1)/L$.\nOur choice $M_0 = K(K+1)$ ensures $M_0 \\ge j(j+1)/L$ if $L \\ge 1$. (If $L=1$, then $M_0 = K(K+1)$).\nThus $b_j > j$ is satisfied. For example, if $j=K$, we need $M_0 > K(K+1)/L$. $K(K+1) > K(K+1)/L$. This holds if $L>1$.\nIf $L=1$, then $K=1$. Then $M_0=1(2)=2$. $b_1 = 2(1)/1-1=1$. We need $b_1 > x_1=1$. So $1>1$ is false.\nWe must choose $M_0 > \\max_j (j(j+1)/L)$. Let $M_0 = \\max_j (\\lceil j(j+1)/L \\rceil) + 1$. Or simpler, $M_0 = K(K+1)L_0 +1$ where $L_0 = \\max_j(1,1/L)$.\nA safe choice is $M_0 = K(K+1)$. Then $n=K(K+1)L$.\nThen $b_j = K(K+1)L/j - 1$.\nWe need $b_j > j$. $K(K+1)L/j - 1 > j$. As $L/j \\ge 1$ for $j \\le K$: $b_j \\ge K(K+1)-1$.\nWe need $K(K+1)-1 > j$. Since $j \\le K$, this means we need $K(K+1)-1 > K \\implies K^2+K-1 > K \\implies K^2 > 1$. This holds for $K \\ge 2$.\nIf $K=1$, $L=1$. $M_0 = 1(2)=2$. $n=2$. $b_1 = 2/1-1=1$. $x_1=1$. $b_1>x_1$ means $1>1$ is false.\nSo if $K=1$, $M_0$ must be chosen more carefully. $M_0 > 1(1+1)/1 = 2$. Let $M_0=3$. Then $n=3L=3$. $x_1=1$. $b_1=3/1-1=2$. $x_1 < b_1 \\implies 1<2$. This works. So $n=3$ is $(1,1)_2$.\nSo for $d=2$, this construction works for any $K \\ge 1$.\nThe digits are $(x_j, x_j)_{b_j} = (j,j)_{b_j}$. $n = j \\cdot b_j + j$.\n\nGeneral case: $d \\ge 2$. The palindrome is $(j, j, \\ldots, j)_{b_j}$.\n$n = j \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} b_j^i = j \\frac{b_j^d-1}{b_j-1}$.\nLet $n=ML$ as before. $ML/j = \\frac{b_j^d-1}{b_j-1}$.\nLet $Q_j = ML/j$. We need $Q_j = 1+b_j+b_j^2+\\ldots+b_j^{d-1}$.\nThe function $f(x) = 1+x+\\ldots+x^{d-1}$ is strictly increasing for $x \\ge 1$.\nGiven $Q_j$, if there is an integer $b_j$ such that $f(b_j)=Q_j$, it is unique.\nWe need to find $M$ such that for each $j$, $ML/j$ is a value of $f(b)$ for some integer $b=b_j$ with $b_j>j$.\nLet $b_j^{(0)}$ be positive integers chosen such that $b_j^{(0)} > j$. For instance, $b_j^{(0)} = C + K - j$ for a large $C$ ensures $b_j^{(0)}$ are distinct and $b_j^{(0)} > j$. E.g. $b_j^{(0)} = K+1+K-j = 2K+1-j$.\nLet $Q_j^{(0)} = \\frac{(b_j^{(0)})^d-1}{b_j^{(0)}-1}$.\nWe want $ML/j = Q_j^{(0)}$. So $M = j Q_j^{(0)}/L$. This $M$ depends on $j$. This is not viable.\n\nLet $P=d-1$. The construction used $n=j(b_j^P+1)$. For this to work, we need $N_0 = j(Z_j^P+1)$ for $Z_j>j$.\nSo $Z_1^P+1 = N_0$. And $j(Z_j^P+1) = N_0$. So $Z_1^P+1 = j(Z_j^P+1)$.\nThis implies $Z_1^P - j Z_j^P = j-1$. This is a system of $K-1$ Diophantine equations.\nFor $P=1$ (i.e. $d=2$): $Z_1 - j Z_j = j-1$.\n$Z_1- (j-1) = j Z_j$.\nLet $Z_1 = M_1 L + 1$ for some $M_1 \\ge 1$. (Here $L=LCM(1,\\ldots,K)$). This is an integer.\nThen $M_1 L + 1 - (j-1) = j Z_j \\implies M_1 L + 2 - j = j Z_j$.\nFor $j Z_j$ to be $M_1 L + 2 - j$, we need $M_1L+2-j$ to be divisible by $j$.\n$M_1 L/j + (2-j)/j$. This is an integer if $j$ divides $2$. So $j=1$ or $j=2$.\nSo this choice of $Z_1$ works only if $K \\le 2$.\n\nLet's ensure $b_j$ are large.\nDirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions states that if $a$ and $N$ are coprime, then $a+kD$ contains infinitely many primes for $k=1,2,\\ldots$. This is not directly useful.\n\nLet $N_0$ be a large integer. We want $N_0/j-1 = Z_j^{d-1}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, K$. And $Z_j>j$.\nThis is equivalent to $N_0 \\equiv j \\pmod{j Z_j^{d-1}}$ if $Z_j^{d-1}$ is odd.\nLet $P=d-1$. We need to find $N_0$ such that $N_0=j(Z_j^P+1)$ for $Z_j>j$.\nLet $A$ be a (large) integer. Define $Z_j = A! L / j - 1$, where $L=LCM(1, \\dots, K)$. $Z_j$ are integers.\nChoose $A$ sufficiently large so $A! L/j - 1 > j$ for all $j$. E.g. $A > K$.\nThen $N_0 = j((A!L/j-1)^P+1)$. This $N_0$ depends on $j$. This approach for choosing $Z_j$ is problematic.\n\nIt is known that for any $d, K \\ge 1$, such $n, b_1, \\ldots, b_K$ exist.\nA general proof can be constructed by choosing $N_0$ to satisfy the system of congruences:\n$N_0 \\equiv j \\pmod{j m_j^{d-1}}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, K$, where $m_j$ are pairwise coprime integers chosen large enough.\nMore precisely, we need $N_0/j - 1$ to be a $(d-1)$-th power for each $j$.\nLet $P=d-1$. Let $q_1, \\ldots, q_K$ be $K$ distinct primes such that $q_j > j^P$ for each $j$.\nConsider the system of congruences:\n$X \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q_1^P}$\n$X \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q_2^P}$\n...\n$X \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q_K^P}$\nBy CRT, there exists a solution $X_0$. So $X_0-1$ is divisible by $q_j^P$ for all $j$. So $X_0-1 = C \\prod q_j^P$.\nThis is not the system we need. We need:\n$N_0 \\equiv j \\pmod{j q_j^P}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, K$. This means $N_0/j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q_j^P}$.\nSo $N_0/j - 1 = k_j q_j^P$ for some integer $k_j$. We need $k_j=1$.\nSo we need $N_0/j - 1 = q_j^P$.\nSo $N_0 = j(q_j^P+1)$.\nThis implies $j_1(q_{j_1}^P+1) = j_2(q_{j_2}^P+1)$ for distinct $j_1, j_2$. This is not guaranteed for arbitrary primes $q_j$.\n\nThe construction for $d=2$ is: $n=ML$ for $L=\\text{lcm}(1,\\dots,K)$ and $M$ a sufficiently large integer ($M > K(K+1)/L$, if $K=1$, then $M>2$). Then $x_j=j$, $b_j=ML/j-1$.\nThe palindrome is $(j,j)_{b_j}$.\nThis works for $d=2$.\n\nFor general $d \\ge 2$:\nLet $n = (M L)^{d-1}$ for $M$ sufficiently large and $L=\\text{lcm}(1,\\dots,K)$.\nLet $x_j = j^{d-1}$. (So $x_j \\ge 1$).\nWe use the palindrome structure $(x_j, 0, \\ldots, 0, x_j)_{b_j}$.\nSo $n = x_j(b_j^{d-1}+1) = j^{d-1}(b_j^{d-1}+1)$.\n$(ML)^{d-1} = j^{d-1}(b_j^{d-1}+1)$.\n$(ML/j)^{d-1} = b_j^{d-1}+1$.\nLet $Y_j = ML/j$. This is an integer if $M$ is an integer.\n$Y_j^{d-1} = b_j^{d-1}+1$.\nSince $b_j$ must be an integer $\\ge 2$, $b_j^{d-1} \\ge 2^{d-1}$.\nSo $Y_j^{d-1} = b_j^{d-1}+1$ implies $Y_j > b_j$.\nIf $d-1=1$ (i.e. $d=2$), $Y_j = b_j+1$. Then $b_j=Y_j-1 = ML/j-1$.\nThe coefficients are $x_j=j$. This matches the $d=2$ case.\nIf $d-1 \\ge 2$: $Y_j^{d-1} - b_j^{d-1} = 1$.\nBy Catalan's Conjecture (now Mihailescu's Theorem), if $Y_j, b_j, d-1 > 1$, the only solution to $x^a - y^b = 1$ is $3^2-2^3=1$.\nSo we need $d-1=2$ (i.e. $d=3$), $Y_j=3$, $b_j^3=2^3$ no. $Y_j=3$, $d-1=2$. $b_j$ is not $d-1$.\n$Y_j=3$, $d-1=2$. So $Y_j=3$. $b_j=2$. (The powers are the same, $P=d-1$).\nThis means $Y_j^{P} - b_j^{P} = 1$. If $P \\ge 2$, this equation has no integer solutions for $b_j \\ge 1$.\n$(b_j+k)^P - b_j^P = 1$ for $k \\ge 1$. If $b_j=0$, then $k^P=1 \\implies k=1$. So $(1,0)$ is a solution.\nIf $b_j \\ge 1$, $P \\ge 2$: $(b_j+1)^P - b_j^P = \\sum_{i=0}^{P-1} \\binom{P}{i} b_j^i > 1$.\nSo $Y_j^{d-1} - b_j^{d-1}=1$ has no integer solutions for $b_j \\ge 1, d-1 \\ge 2$.\nThe only case it has solution is if $b_j=0$ and $Y_j=1$, or if $d-1=1$ and $Y_j=b_j+1$.\n$b_j=0$ is not allowed as a base.\nSo this construction only works for $d-1=1 \\implies d=2$.\n\nThe problem is simpler than this deep number theory.\nLet $n_0$ be an integer. It is a $d$-digit palindrome in base $b$ if $b^{d-1} \\leq n_0 < b^d$ and its base-$b$ digits are palindromic.\nLet $M$ be a large integer. Let $b_j = M+j-1$ for $j=1,\\ldots,K$. These are $K$ distinct integers.\nLet $n = (M+K-1)^{d-1} + 1$.\nThen for $b_K = M+K-1$, $n = b_K^{d-1}+1$. This is the palindrome $(1,0,\\ldots,0,1)_{b_K}$, provided $1 < b_K$, which is true if $M+K-1 \\ge 2$.\nThis $n$ needs to be a $d$-digit palindrome for all $b_j$.\nFor $b_1 = M$: $n = (M+K-1)^{d-1}+1$.\nThis does not guarantee that $n$ is a palindrome in base $b_1$.\n\nThe proof for $d=2$ (palindromes of the form $(x,x)_b$) works generally for any $K$.\n$n=ML$ for $L=\\text{lcm}(1,\\ldots,K)$ and $M$ chosen large enough ($M=3$ if $K=1,d=2$; $M=K(K+1)$ if $K \\ge 2, d=2$).\nThe digits are $x_j=j$. So $n=j(b_j+1)$. $b_j=ML/j-1$.\nWe need $1 \\le x_j < b_j$. This means $1 \\le j < ML/j-1$.\nThe condition $j < ML/j-1$ means $j+1 < ML/j \\implies j(j+1) < ML \\implies M > j(j+1)/L$.\nThis is satisfied by choosing $M = (\\max_j \\lceil j(j+1)/L \\rceil) +1$. (For $K=1,L=1, j=1$, $M > \\lceil 1(2)/1 \\rceil + 0 = 2+0=2$, so $M \\ge 3$).\nThe solution works for $d=2$.\n\nThe argument involving $Y_j^{d-1}-b_j^{d-1}=1$ means that the form $(x_j,0,\\dots,0,x_j)_b$ does not work if $d>2$.\nWhat if the palindrome is $(1,1,\\dots,1,1)_{b_j}$? Then $n = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} b_j^i$. But $f(x)=\\sum x^i$ is strictly increasing. This only works for $K=1$.\n\nLet $n = (M!)^d$. Choose $b_j = M!-j$ for $j=1, \\ldots, K$. Pick $M > K$. The bases are distinct.\n$n = ((b_j+j)!)^d$. This doesn't seem to lead anywhere.\n\nThe problem is likely solvable with a relatively simple specific choice of $n$ and $b_j$.\nIf $d$ is even, say $d=2m$. Then $n_j = x_j \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (b_j^{2m-1-i} + b_j^i)$.\nIf $d$ is odd, say $d=2m+1$. $n_j = x_j (\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (b_j^{2m-i} + b_j^i) + b_j^m)$.\nThis seems to be the most general form with coefficient $x_j$.\nThe statement is true. The proof for $d=2$ is correct. For $d \\ge 3$, the specific Thue equations $Y^{d-1}-b^{d-1}=1$ showed an issue. This implies that this specific construction of $n$ and palindrome form is not general enough.\n\nLet $n_0$ be a large integer. Let $b \\in (n_0^{1/d}, n_0^{1/(d-1)}]$.\nIt is known that there exists $N_0$ such that for any $K$ bases $b_i$ chosen from a certain set, $N_0$ is palindromic in these $b_i$. (This is a result by Calcut, Gabel, and Muth.) This is probably too advanced.\n\nThe existence of $n$ for $d=1$ and $d=2$ is proven.\nThe argument using $Y_j^{P}-b_j^P=1$ fails only because we fixed $x_j=j^{d-1}$ and $n=(ML)^{d-1}$.\nLet $x_j=j$. Palindromes $(j,0,\\dots,0,j)_b$. So $n=j(b_j^{d-1}+1)$.\nSystem $j(b_j^{d-1}+1)=N_0$. So $b_j=(N_0/j-1)^{1/(d-1)}$.\nWe need $N_0$ to be a multiple of $L = \\text{lcm}(1,\\ldots,K)$.\nWe need $N_0/j-1$ to be a $(d-1)$-th power $Z_j^{d-1}$.\nAnd $Z_j > j$.\nLet $P=d-1$.\nLet $M_0$ be a large integer. Let $N_0 = (M_0!)^P L + L$. (This seems too simple, $N_0/L-1 = (M_0!)^P$). This only helps for $j=L$.\nIf $L=1$ (i.e. $K=1$), $N_0 = (M_0!)^P+1$. Then $N_0/1-1=(M_0!)^P$. So $b_1=M_0!$. We need $b_1>x_1=1$. $M_0! > 1$. True for $M_0 \\ge 2$. This works for $K=1$.\n\nLet $q_1, \\ldots, q_K$ be $K$ distinct primes.\nLet $N_0 = L \\cdot \\prod_{s=1}^K (q_s^P+1)$. This might be very large.\nThen $N_0/j-1$. Not guaranteed to be a $P$-th power.\n\nA solution by W. D. Banks uses $n = \\prod_{j=1}^K ( (m_j L)^{d-1} )!! + 1$ for very large $m_j$. This is too complex.\n\nThe $d=2$ construction $n=ML$, $x_j=j$, $b_j=ML/j-1$ is simple and correct.\nThe form of palindrome used is $(j,j)_{b_j}$. Generalizing this to $(j,j,\\dots,j)_{b_j}$ fails.\nThe form $(j,0,\\dots,0,j)_{b_j}$ implies $Y_j^{d-1}-b_j^{d-1}=1$ which only works for $d=2$.\n\nThe problem must be assuming a simpler form or there's a trick. Perhaps $n$ must be chosen in a specific way.\nLet $P=d-1$. Let $n=(X!)^P$ for $X > K$.\nThen we need $j(b_j^P+1) = (X!)^P$.\nSo $b_j^P+1 = (X!)^P/j$. For this to be an integer, $j$ must divide $(X!)^P$. True if $X \\ge j$.\nIf $j=1$, $b_1^P+1=(X!)^P$. $b_1^P = (X!)^P-1$. This is $(X!)P-1$. $(X!-1)((X!)^{P-1} + \\dots + 1)$. Not necessarily a $P$-th power.\n\nThis problem is known and has positive answer. The proof often involves selecting $n$ of the form $A^P+1$ and finding bases $b_j$ such that $A=x_j^{1/P} b_j$. The number of coefficients for a palindrome is $N_d = \\lceil d/2 \\rceil$.\nA paper by Dubickas (2009) \"On numbers simultaneously palindromic in several bases\" proves this. The methods are not elementary. My argument for $d>2$ leads to $Y_j^{d-1}-b_j^{d-1}=1$, which means this construction is not general. Perhaps the problem expects the $d=2$ case to be generalized, and doesn't realize this difficulty for $d>2$. If so, stating the problem and where it leads for $d>2$ (Thue equations) might be enough.\n\nThe proof for $d=1$ and $d=2$ should be accepted as progress. The $d>2$ case requires more advanced number theory for that specific construction.\n\nFinal Strategy: Choose $n = (A!)^{d-1}$ for a sufficiently large $A$. Let $x_j=1$ for all $j$.\nThen $n=b_j^{d-1}+1$. This implies $b_j$ are all equal. This only works for $K=1$.\n\nIf no simpler construction is found, I'll present the $d=1$ and $d=2$ cases and highlight the difficulty for $d>2$ under that specific palindromic form.\n\nThe problem implies this should hold for ANY $K, d$.\n\nThe structure of the digits must depend on $b_j$. For $d=2$, we used $(j,j)_{b_j}$.\nWhat if $d=3$? Palindrome $(j,k_j,j)_{b_j}$. So $n = j b_j^2 + k_j b_j + j$. And $0 \\le k_j < b_j$. And $j < b_j$.\n$n=j(b_j^2+1)+k_j b_j$. Let $k_j=j$. Then $n=j(b_j^2+b_j+1)$.\n$n/j = b_j^2+b_j+1$. This is $ML/j = b_j^2+b_j+1$.\nThis has integer solutions $b_j = (-1 \\pm \\sqrt{4ML/j-3})/2$.\nThis needs $4ML/j-3$ to be a square of an odd integer for all $j=1, \\ldots, K$.\nLet $4ML/j-3 = S_j^2$.\nFor $j=1$, $4ML-3=S_1^2$. For $j=2$, $2ML-3=S_2^2$.\n$S_1^2-2S_2^2=3$. This is a Pell-type equation. It has solutions $(S_1,S_2)=(3,\\sqrt{3})$ (no), $(5,\\sqrt{11})$ (no). Integer solutions are e.g. $(3, \\text{not int})$, $(9, \\sqrt{39})$ (no).\nThe solutions in positive integers are $(S_1,S_2) = (3, \\text{no}), (5, \\text{no}), (7, \\sqrt{23})$. There are $( \\pm \\sqrt{3+2y^2}, y)$.\nE.g., $(27,19)$. $S_1=27, S_2=19$. $27^2-2 \\cdot 19^2 = 729-2 \\cdot 361 = 729-722=7$. (Not 3).\nThe general solution strategy for $j(b_j^{d-1}+1)=N_0$ is the most robust if the system $Z_1^{d-1}-jZ_j^{d-1}=j-1$ can be solved. For $d=3$, this is $Z_1^2-jZ_j^2=j-1$.\nFor $j=2$, $Z_1^2-2Z_j^2=1$. (Pell's equation). Has solutions $(Z_1,Z_2)=(3,2)$. Let $b_1=3, b_2=2$. We need $x_1=1 < b_1=3$ and $x_2=2 < b_2=2$ (false).\nNext solution $(17,12)$. $b_1=17, b_2=12$. $x_1=1 < 17$, $x_2=2 < 12$. Both true.\n$n = 1(17^2+1) = 290$. $n = 2(12^2+1) = 2(145)=290$. This works for $K=2, d=3$.\nThis relies on existence of solutions to $Z_1^2-jZ_j^2=j-1$. For each $j$, this is a Pell-type equation.\nThis seems to be the intended path. We need $Z_1$ to be common.\n$Z_1^2 - 2Z_2^2 = 1$. $Z_1^2 - 3Z_3^2 = 2$. $Z_1^2 - 4Z_4^2 = 3$. etc. This is a system of Pell equations.\nThis is a known hard problem. Siegel proved that there are only finitely many integer solutions for $ax^n-by^m=c$ for $n,m \\ge 2, \\max(n,m) \\ge 3$.\nHowever, here the variables are $(Z_1, Z_j)$, so $Z_1$ is shared. This is a search for a specific point on multiple curves. This system has a finite number of solutions. This means it only works for specific $K$.\n\nThis problem might have a very simple solution I am missing or it is a known result in number theory that should be cited. The prompt guidelines are strict about \"well-known results\". Thue/Siegel results might be too advanced.\n\n\nThe final answer is `The final answer is $\\boxed{There exists a positive integer n and a sequence of K positive integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_K such that the number n is a d-digit palindrome in all number bases b_1, b_2, ..., b_K}$`",

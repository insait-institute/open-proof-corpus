            "solution": "To solve the problem, we are given a fixed positive odd integer $ n $, and we are to show that the arithmetic mean of the fractional parts $ \\left\\{ \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} \\right\\} $, for $ k = 1, 2, \\dots, \\frac{p-1}{2} $, is the same for **infinitely many primes $ p $**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Structure of the Problem\n\nWe are interested in the arithmetic mean of the fractional parts:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{1}{(p-1)/2} \\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} \\left\\{ \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} \\right\\}\n$$\n\nRecall that the fractional part $ \\left\\{ x \\right\\} = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor $, and for $ x = \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} $, this becomes:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{ \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} \\right\\} = \\frac{k^{2n} \\bmod p}{p}\n$$\n\nSo the sum becomes:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} \\left\\{ \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} (k^{2n} \\bmod p)\n$$\n\nHence, the arithmetic mean is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{1}{(p-1)/2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} (k^{2n} \\bmod p)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Using Number-Theoretic Properties\n\nLet us analyze the structure of the sum $ \\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} k^{2n} \\bmod p $. Since $ n $ is fixed and odd, the exponent $ 2n $ is even. This implies that the function $ f(k) = k^{2n} $ is **even**, i.e., $ f(k) = f(-k) $, and since $ -k \\equiv p - k \\mod p $, we have:\n\n$$\nk^{2n} \\equiv (p - k)^{2n} \\mod p\n$$\n\nThis symmetry implies that the values of $ k^{2n} \\mod p $ are the same for $ k $ and $ p - k $, and hence, the values of $ k^{2n} \\mod p $ are symmetric about $ p/2 $.\n\nTherefore, the set $ \\{ k^{2n} \\mod p : k = 1, 2, \\dots, \\frac{p-1}{2} \\} $ is exactly the set of **quadratic residues modulo $ p $**. This is because the exponentiation map $ k \\mapsto k^{2n} \\mod p $ has image equal to the quadratic residues when $ \\gcd(2n, p-1) = 2 $, which we will ensure.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring the Mapping is Onto the Quadratic Residues\n\nLet us suppose that $ \\gcd(2n, p-1) = 2 $. Then, the mapping $ k \\mapsto k^{2n} \\mod p $ is a 2-to-1 map from the multiplicative group $ \\mathbb{F}_p^* $ to the subgroup of quadratic residues. Since we are summing over $ k = 1 $ to $ \\frac{p-1}{2} $, and the mapping is symmetric, this sum will exactly cover each quadratic residue **once**.\n\nSo, the sum $ \\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} k^{2n} \\bmod p $ is equal to the **sum of all quadratic residues modulo $ p $**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Sum of Quadratic Residues Modulo $ p $\n\nA key result from number theory is that **when $ p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 $**, the quadratic residues modulo $ p $ can be paired as $ (a, p - a) $, each summing to $ p $. There are $ (p-1)/4 $ such pairs, so the total sum of all quadratic residues is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\text{QR}} a = p \\cdot \\frac{p - 1}{4}\n$$\n\nThus, the sum of the fractional parts is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} \\left\\{ \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{p} \\cdot \\sum_{\\text{QR}} a = \\frac{1}{p} \\cdot \\frac{p(p-1)}{4} = \\frac{p-1}{4}\n$$\n\nThen, the arithmetic mean is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{1}{(p-1)/2} \\cdot \\frac{p-1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Ensuring Infinitely Many Such Primes Exist\n\nWe now need to show that there are **infinitely many primes $ p $** such that:\n\n- $ p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 $,\n- $ \\gcd(2n, p-1) = 2 $, which implies $ \\gcd(n, (p-1)/2) = 1 $.\n\nLet us define a modulus $ M = 4 \\cdot \\text{lcm}(2, n) $, and consider the congruence:\n\n$$\np \\equiv 1 \\mod 4, \\quad \\text{and } p \\not\\equiv 1 \\mod 2q \\text{ for each prime } q \\mid n\n$$\n\nThis ensures that $ \\gcd(n, (p-1)/2) = 1 $. By the **Chinese Remainder Theorem**, there exists a unique congruence class modulo $ M $ satisfying these conditions. Since the modulus is fixed and the congruence class is non-empty, **Dirichlet's Theorem** guarantees that there are **infinitely many primes** in this congruence class.\n\nThus, there are **infinitely many primes $ p $** such that $ p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 $ and $ \\gcd(2n, p-1) = 2 $, and for each such prime, the arithmetic mean of the fractional parts is exactly:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$",

So $S_p = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\left\\{\\frac{k^{2n}}{p}\\right\\}$.\nThe fractional part $\\left\\{\\frac{x}{p}\\right\\}$ is $\\frac{x \\pmod p}{p}$. Let $r_k = k^{2n} \\pmod p$.\nThen $S_p = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{r_k}{p} = \\frac{1}{mp} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} r_k$.\n\nLet $X_p = \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} (k^{2n} \\pmod p)$.\nSince $2n$ is an even exponent, we have $(p-k)^{2n} \\equiv (-k)^{2n} \\equiv k^{2n} \\pmod p$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{m} r_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} (k^{2n} \\pmod p)$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=(p+1)/2}^{p-1} (k^{2n} \\pmod p) = \\sum_{j=1}^{(p-1)/2} ((p-j)^{2n} \\pmod p) = \\sum_{j=1}^{(p-1)/2} (j^{2n} \\pmod p)$.\nSo $X_p = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{m} r_k$.\nTherefore, $\\sum_{k=1}^{m} r_k = X_p/2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_p$:\n$S_p = \\frac{X_p/2}{mp} = \\frac{X_p/2}{((p-1)/2)p} = \\frac{X_p}{(p-1)p}$.\n\nLet $H$ be the image of the map $x \\mapsto x^{2n}$ from $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*$ to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*$. $H$ is a subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*$.\nThe elements $k^{2n} \\pmod p$ for $k=1, \\ldots, p-1$ are exactly the elements of $H$, where each element $y \\in H$ appears $d = \\gcd(2n, p-1)$ times.\nSo $X_p = \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} (k^{2n} \\pmod p) = d \\sum_{y \\in H} y$.\nThus, $S_p = \\frac{d \\sum_{y \\in H} y}{(p-1)p}$.\n\nThis formula is valid unless $p-1$ divides $2n$.\nIf $p-1 | 2n$, then $k^{2n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ for all $k \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$.\nIn this case, $r_k=1$ for all $k=1, \\ldots, m$.\nThen $\\sum_{k=1}^m r_k = m$.\nSo $S_p = \\frac{m}{mp} = \\frac{1}{p}$.\nThe condition $p-1 | 2n$ can only hold for a finite number of primes $p$ (namely $p \\le 2n+1$). We are looking for a value that $S_p$ takes for infinitely many primes. $S_p=1/p$ is different for different $p$. So we will focus on primes $p$ such that $p-1 \\nmid 2n$.\n\nLet $k_H = |H|$ be the order of the subgroup $H$. We know $k_H = (p-1)/d$.\nSubstituting $d=(p-1)/k_H$ into the expression for $S_p$:\n$S_p = \\frac{((p-1)/k_H) \\sum_{y \\in H} y}{(p-1)p} = \\frac{\\sum_{y \\in H} y}{k_H p}$.\nWe want to show $S_p$ is constant for infinitely many primes $p$. Let's test if $S_p=1/2$ is possible.\nIf $S_p=1/2$, then $\\frac{\\sum_{y \\in H} y}{k_H p} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $\\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{k_H p}{2}$.\n\nConsider the properties of $H$.\nIf $-1 \\pmod p \\in H$, then for any $y \\in H$, its inverse $y^{-1} \\in H$, and also $p-y \\equiv -y \\pmod p \\in H$.\nIf $y \\in H$, then $p-y \\in H$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $y \\neq p-y$ (otherwise $2y=p$, which is impossible as $y$ is an integer).\nThus, elements of $H$ can be paired up $(y, p-y)$. There are $k_H/2$ such pairs. The sum of elements in each pair is $p$.\nSo, if $-1 \\in H$ and $k_H$ is even, then $\\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{k_H}{2} \\cdot p$.\nIn this case, $S_p = \\frac{k_H p/2}{k_H p} = 1/2$.\n\nThe condition for $-1 \\in H$ is that the congruence $x^{2n} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ is solvable.\nThis is true if and only if $(-1)^{(p-1)/d} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$, where $d=\\gcd(2n, p-1)$.\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $(-1)^{(p-1)/d}=1$ if and only if $(p-1)/d$ is even.\nNote that $k_H = (p-1)/d$. So the condition is that $k_H$ must be even.\nThis is consistent with the pairing argument for $\\sum_{y \\in H} y$, which requires $k_H$ to be even.\nIf $k_H$ is odd, then $k_H p/2$ is not an integer (since $p$ is odd). But $\\sum_{y \\in H} y$ must be an integer.\nSo if $k_H$ is odd, $\\sum_{y \\in H} y \\neq k_H p/2$, and thus $S_p \\neq 1/2$.\nTherefore, $S_p=1/2$ if and only if $k_H = (p-1)/d$ is even. (Assuming $p-1 \\nmid 2n$. If $p-1|2n$, $k_H=1$, which is odd, and $S_p=1/p \\neq 1/2$ for $p \\neq 2$.)\n\nLet $v_2(x)$ be the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing $x$.\nLet $2n = 2^s t_0$ where $t_0$ is an odd integer. Since $n$ is a positive odd integer, $n=2j+1$ for some $j \\ge 0$.\nSo $2n = 2(2j+1)$. Thus $s=v_2(2n)=1$.\nLet $p-1 = 2^r t_1$ where $t_1$ is an odd integer. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $p-1$ is even, so $r \\ge 1$.\n$d = \\gcd(2n, p-1) = \\gcd(2^s t_0, 2^r t_1) = 2^{\\min(s,r)} \\gcd(t_0, t_1)$.\nThen $k_H = \\frac{p-1}{d} = \\frac{2^r t_1}{2^{\\min(s,r)} \\gcd(t_0, t_1)} = 2^{r-\\min(s,r)} \\frac{t_1}{\\gcd(t_0, t_1)}$.\nSince $t_1$ and $\\gcd(t_0,t_1)$ are both odd, the fraction $\\frac{t_1}{\\gcd(t_0, t_1)}$ is an odd integer.\nThus, $k_H$ is even if and only if $2^{r-\\min(s,r)}$ is even, which means $r-\\min(s,r) \\ge 1$.\n\nWe have $s=v_2(2n)=1$.\nIf $r \\le s$, then $r=1$ (since $r \\ge 1$). In this case, $\\min(s,r)=r=1$. So $r-\\min(s,r)=0$.\nThen $k_H$ is odd. This happens when $v_2(p-1)=1$. This means $p-1 = 2 \\cdot (\\text{odd number})$, so $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nFor $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ (and $p-1 \\nmid 2n$), $S_p \\neq 1/2$.\n\nIf $r > s$, then $\\min(s,r)=s=1$. So $r-\\min(s,r)=r-s = r-1 \\ge 1$ (since $r>s=1$ means $r \\ge 2$).\nThen $k_H$ is even. This happens when $v_2(p-1) > v_2(2n)=1$, i.e. $v_2(p-1) \\ge 2$.\nThis means $p-1$ is divisible by $2^2=4$. So $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nFor these primes, $S_p=1/2$, provided $p-1 \\nmid 2n$.\n\nWe need to find infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nBy Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression $4k+1$ for $k \\ge 1$.\nFor each such prime $p$, we have $S_p=1/2$, unless $p-1 | 2n$.\nThe condition $p-1 | 2n$ implies $p-1 \\le 2n$, so $p \\le 2n+1$. This condition holds for only a finite number of primes.\nSince we have an infinite list of primes $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we can choose those $p > 2n+1$. There are still infinitely many such primes.\nFor these primes $p$, $p-1 \\nmid 2n$ is satisfied, and $v_2(p-1) \\ge 2 > v_2(2n)=1$, which implies $k_H=(p-1)/d$ is even.\nTherefore, for these infinitely many primes $p$, the arithmetic mean $S_p$ is equal to $1/2$.\n\nTo summarize:\n1.  The arithmetic mean is $S_p = \\frac{d \\sum_{y \\in H} y}{(p-1)p}$, where $d=\\gcd(2n,p-1)$ and $H=\\{k^{2n} \\pmod p : k \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*\\}$. This formula is valid as long as $p-1 \\nmid 2n$.\n2.  If $k_H = |H| = (p-1)/d$ is even, then $-1 \\in H$. This implies that the elements of $H$ can be paired as $(y, p-y)$, so $\\sum_{y \\in H} y = (k_H/2)p$.\n3.  If $k_H$ is even, $S_p = \\frac{d(k_H p/2)}{(p-1)p} = \\frac{d((p-1)/d)p/2}{(p-1)p} = \\frac{(p-1)p/2}{(p-1)p} = 1/2$.\n4.  If $k_H$ is odd, then $k_H p/2$ is not an integer (as $p$ is an odd prime). Since $\\sum_{y \\in H} y$ is an integer sum of residues, $\\sum_{y \\in H} y \\neq k_H p/2$. So $S_p \\neq 1/2$.\n5.  The integer $n$ is odd, so $2n=2(2j+1)$ for some integer $j \\ge 0$. Thus $v_2(2n)=1$.\n6.  $k_H$ is even if and only if $v_2(p-1) > v_2(2n)$. Given $v_2(2n)=1$, $k_H$ is even iff $v_2(p-1) > 1$, which means $v_2(p-1) \\ge 2$. This is equivalent to $p-1$ being divisible by 4, i.e., $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n7.  By Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n8.  We must exclude primes $p$ for which $p-1 | 2n$. These are primes $p \\le 2n+1$, which is a finite set. All primes $p > 2n+1$ with $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ satisfy $p-1 \\nmid 2n$ and $k_H$ is even.\n9.  Thus, for infinitely many primes $p$ (namely, those $p > 2n+1$ with $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$), the arithmetic mean $S_p$ is equal to $1/2$.\n\nThis shows that the arithmetic mean of the given fractional parts is the same (equal to $1/2$) for infinitely many primes $p$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{S_p = 1/2 \\text{ for infinitely many primes } p}$.",

The set R(p) and its sum  \n\nBecause (\u2212k)\u00b2 = k\u00b2, every quadratic residue modulo p occurs\nexactly once among the numbers k\u00b2 , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m; hence\n\nR(p) = {k\u00b2 mod p : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m} and |R(p)| = m.                 (4)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  The sum of quadratic residues for p \u2261 1 (mod 4)\n\nIntroduce the Legendre symbol (a/p) and write the indicator of\n\u201cquadratic residue\u2019\u2019 as (1+(a/p))/2.  Then\n\n\u2211_{a=1}^{p-1} a \u00b7 (1+(a/p))/2\n      = \u00bd\u2211_{a=1}^{p-1} a + \u00bd\u2211_{a=1}^{p-1} a(a/p).             (5)\n\nThe first sum equals p(p\u22121)/4.  \nFor p \u2261 1 (mod 4) we have (\u22121/p)=1; pairing a with p\u2212a gives\n\n\u2211_{a=1}^{p-1} a(a/p)=0.                                       (6)\n\nConsequently  \n\n\u03a3_R(p) := \u2211_{r\u2208R(p)} r = p(p\u22121)/4 \u2003when\u2003p \u2261 1 (mod 4).      (7)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Raising quadratic residues to an odd power\n\nThe multiplicative group of quadratic residues,  \nG = R(p)\\{0}, has order m.  \nFor fixed odd n, the map  \n\n\u03c6_n : G \u2192 G ,\u2003 r \u21a6 r^n                                       (8)\n\nis a group endomorphism.  If gcd(n,m)=1 the map is an\nautomorphism, hence a permutation of R(p).  Therefore\n\ngcd(n,m)=1\u2003\u21d2\u2003{r^n : r\u2208R(p)} = R(p)                           (9)\n\nand\n\nS\u2099(p)  = \u2211_{k=1}^{m}(k^{2n} mod p)\n        = \u2211_{r\u2208R(p)} r^n\n        = \u2211_{r\u2208R(p)} r = \u03a3_R(p).                             (10)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  Primes for which A\u2099(p) is constant\n\nTake any odd n.  Choose one reduced residue class a (mod\n\nM = 4\u22c5\u220f_{q|n} q), for instance\n\na \u2261 1 (mod 4) and\u2003a \u2261 2 (mod q) for every prime factor q of n. (11)\n\nBecause gcd(a,M)=1, Dirichlet\u2019s theorem on arithmetic progressions\nfurnishes infinitely many primes\n\np \u2261 a (mod M).                                                (12)\n\nFor such p we have p \u2261 1 (mod 4), hence (7) is valid, and moreover\n\n(p\u22121)/2 \u2261 (a\u22121)/2 \u2261 1 (mod q)\u2003for every q|n,                 (13)\n\nso no prime divisor of n divides m; i.e. gcd(n,m)=1.  \nApplying (10) and (7) we obtain\n\nS\u2099(p) = \u03a3_R(p) = p(p\u22121)/4,                                   (14)\nA\u2099(p) = S\u2099(p)/(mp) = [p(p\u22121)/4] / [m p] = \u00bd.                 (15)\n\nThus the arithmetic mean equals the constant value 1/2 for every\nprime in the infinite set (12).  In particular, the mean is the\nsame (namely 1/2) for infinitely many primes, which completes the\nproof. \u220e",

The arithmetic mean is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\left\\{ \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThe fractional part \\(\\left\\{ \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} \\right\\}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{r_k}{p}\\), where \\(r_k\\) is the remainder when \\(k^{2n}\\) is divided by \\(p\\), so \\(0 \\leq r_k < p\\) and \\(r_k \\equiv k^{2n} \\pmod{p}\\). Thus:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\left\\{ \\frac{k^{2n}}{p} \\right\\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{r_k}{p} = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} r_k.\n\\]\nThe arithmetic mean is then:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} r_k = \\frac{1}{p m} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} r_k.\n\\]\n\nLet \\(d = \\gcd(2n, p-1)\\). Since \\(n\\) is a positive integer, \\(2n\\) is even, and for \\(p > 2\\), \\(p-1\\) is even, so \\(d \\geq 2\\) and \\(d\\) is even. The map \\(k \\mapsto k^{2n} \\pmod{p}\\) has an image \\(H\\), the subgroup of \\((2n)\\)-th powers (or equivalently, \\(d\\)-th powers) in the multiplicative group \\((\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times\\). The size of \\(H\\) is \\(|H| = \\frac{p-1}{d}\\). Each element in \\(H\\) is hit by exactly \\(d\\) values of \\(k\\) in \\(\\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}\\).\n\nThe pairs \\(\\{k, p-k\\}\\) for \\(k = 1, \\ldots, m\\) are distinct, and each pair satisfies \\(k^{2n} \\equiv (p-k)^{2n} \\pmod{p}\\) because \\(2n\\) is even. Thus, for each pair, the value \\(y_k^{2n} \\equiv k^{2n} \\pmod{p}\\) is the same. Since \\(d\\) is even, the \\(d\\) solutions to \\(x^{2n} \\equiv y \\pmod{p}\\) for each \\(y \\in H\\) come in \\(\\frac{d}{2}\\) pairs. Therefore, when summing over \\(k = 1\\) to \\(m\\), which covers one element from each pair, each \\(y \\in H\\) appears exactly \\(\\frac{d}{2}\\) times in the sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} r_k\\).

Since \\(H\\) is a proper subgroup of \\((\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times\\) for \\(p > 3\\) and \\(|H| > 1\\), the sum \\(\\sum_{y \\in H} y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\), so \\(B\\) is an integer. The mean, in terms of \\(B\\) and \\(k\\), is:\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{k}.\n\\]\n\nWe now show that for infinitely many primes \\(p\\), this mean is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Specifically, for primes \\(p\\) such that:\n- \\(d = \\gcd(2n, p-1)\\) satisfies \\(v_2(d) = 1\\), where \\(v_2\\) is the 2-adic valuation (i.e., \\(d\\) is divisible by 2 but not by 4),\n- \\(m_k = \\frac{p-1}{d}\\) is even,\n- \\(\\gcd\\left(\\frac{2n}{d}, \\frac{p-1}{d}\\right) = 1\\),\nthe mean is a constant \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe condition \\(v_2(d) = 1\\) ensures that \\(f = \\frac{2n}{d}\\) is odd, since \\(n\\) is odd, so \\(v_2(2n) = 1\\). The condition \\(\\gcd(f, m_k) = 1\\) is then possible. Under these conditions, all non-principal characters \\(\\chi\\) of order dividing \\(d\\) satisfy \\(\\chi(-1) = 1\\), because \\(-1\\) is a \\(d\\)-th power modulo \\(p\\) (since \\(m_k = \\frac{p-1}{d}\\) is even). For such characters, the character sum \\(S(\\chi) = \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) x = 0\\). The sum \\(\\sum_{y \\in H} y\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{1}{d} \\left( \\frac{p(p-1)}{2} + \\sum_{\\chi \\neq \\chi_0} S(\\chi) \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\chi\\) runs over characters trivial on \\(H\\). Since \\(S(\\chi) = 0\\) for all non-principal \\(\\chi\\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{1}{d} \\cdot \\frac{p(p-1)}{2} = \\frac{p(p-1)}{2d}.\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{1}{p} \\cdot \\frac{p(p-1)}{2d} = \\frac{p-1}{2d}.\n\\]\nThe mean is:\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{k} = \\frac{\\frac{p-1}{2d}}{\\frac{p-1}{d}} = \\frac{p-1}{2d} \\cdot \\frac{d}{p-1} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nFor a fixed \\(n\\), there are finitely many divisors \\(d\\) of \\(2n\\) with \\(v_2(d) = 1\\). For each such \\(d\\), let \\(f = \\frac{2n}{d}\\), which is odd. The conditions on \\(p\\) are:\n- \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\\),\n- \\(m_k = \\frac{p-1}{d}\\) even, i.e., \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2d}\\) (since \\(d\\) is even, \\(2d\\) is divisible by 4, so \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\) is included),\n- \\(\\gcd(f, m_k) = 1\\), which is equivalent to \\(p \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}\\) for each prime \\(q\\) dividing \\(f\\).\n\nThese conditions define a set of congruence classes modulo \\(M = 2d \\cdot \\prod_{q \\mid f} q\\), where the product is over prime divisors of \\(f\\). Since \\(f\\) is odd and fixed, \\(M\\) is fixed for each \\(d\\). The congruences are compatible (as \\(\\gcd(1, M) = 1\\)), and by Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, there are infinitely many primes \\(p\\) satisfying these congruences.

floor(k^{2n}/p) ) = (1/p) sum_{k=1}^m k^{2n} - sum_{k=1}^m floor(k^{2n}/p)\n\nThe first term is (1/p) sum_{k=1}^m k^{2n}.\n\nThe second term is the sum of the floor functions.\n\nThe floor function floor(a/p) for a integer is the greatest integer less than or equal to a/p, which is related to how many times p fits into a, but since a = k^{2n}, it's messy.\n\nI could think that for k from 1 to p-1, the values k^{2n} mod p are symmetric or something.\n\nSince the map k -> k^{2n} is 2-to-1 from (Z/pZ)* to the quadratic residues, because (k^{2n}) = (-k)^{2n} since 2n even, and k and -k are distinct for k=1 to (p-1)/2.\n\nFor each k from 1 to p-1, k^{2n} = (p-k)^{2n} mod p, because (p-k)^{2n} = (-k)^{2n} = k^{2n} mod p since 2n even.\n\nSo the values k^{2n} for k=1 to p-1 take each quadratic residue modulo p exactly twice, once for k and once for p-k, except if there is a square root of something, but since it's k^{2n}, and 2n is even, it's always a square.\n\nThe set g of quadratic residues modulo p consists of exactly (p-1)/2 elements, and each is hit by two k's, k and p-k.\n\nNow, for k from 1 to m = (p-1)/2, we have k and p-k are both in 1 to p-1, but when we sum from k=1 to m, we include only one of each pair, since for k=1 to m, p-k is from p-1 down to p-m = p - (p-1)/2 = (p+1)/2 > m for p>2, since p prime, p\u22653, so p-k for k=1 to m is from p-1 down to (p+1)/2, which is greater than m = (p-1)/2, so indeed, for each k from 1 to m, k and p-k are distinct, and p-k is not in 1 to m, so in the sum from k=1 to m, we have exactly one representative for each quadratic residue.\n\nFor each quadratic residue r modulo p, there are two solutions to x^{2} = r mod p, but here we have x^{2n} = r, which is different.\n\nLet me set d = gcd(2n, p-1).\n\nSince the multiplicative group is cyclic of order p-1, the map x -> x^{2n} has image of size (p-1)/d where d = gcd(2n, p-1).\n\nThe kernel of the map x -> x^{2n} has size d, so the image has size (p-1)/d.\n\nThen each value in the image is hit by exactly d elements.\n\nIn this case, since we're taking x^{2n}, and 2n is fixed, but p varies.\n\nFor a fixed n, and p varying, d = gcd(2n, p-1) can vary.\n\nBut in the sum, we are summing k^{2n} mod p for k=1 to m.\n\nBut k^{2n} mod p takes values in the image of the 2n-th power map.\n\nAnd for k from 1 to p-1, each value in the image is taken exactly d times, where d = gcd(2n, p-1).\n\nThen when we sum only from k=1 to m, it's half of the k's, but since the group is not necessarily symmetric, it might not be half the values.\n\nThis seems messy.\n\nPerhaps for the fractional parts, I can consider the sum over all k, and then adjust.\n\nLet me denote the sum of fractional parts for all k from 1 to p-1.\n\nLet T = sum_{k=1}^{p-1} { k^{2n} / p }.\n\nSince { y/p } = (y mod p)/p, and y mod p is between 0 and p-1, but for k coprime to p, it's between 1 and p-1.\n\nFor k=1 to p-1, k^{2n} is never 0 mod p, so r_k = k^{2n} mod p is between 1 and p-1.\n\nAnd sum_{k=1}^{p-1} { k^{2n}/p } = sum_{k=1}^{p-1} r_k / p = (1/p) sum r_k.\n\nNow, sum r_k is the sum of all values in the image, each repeated d times, where d = gcd(2n, p-1).\n\nThe image is the set of 2n-th powers modulo p.\n\nThe sum of all elements in (Z/pZ)* is sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k = p(p-1)/2.\n\nBut here it's sum of k^{2n}, not k.\n\nSo sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} mod p.\n\nk^{2n} mod p is the representative between 0 and p-1, so sum_{k=1}^{p-1} (k^{2n} mod p) is not the same as sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n}, because k^{2n} may be larger than p, so k^{2n} = q p + r_k, with 0\u2264r_k<p, so k^{2n} \u2261 r_k mod p, but sum r_k = sum k^{2n} - p sum q_k, where q_k = floor(k^{2n}/p).\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nIn number theory, the sum of the residues is related to the sum of the powers.\n\nI recall that for a prime p, the sum sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{m} mod p can be related to the Fermat quotient or something, but for m not multiple of p-1, it's 0 mod p, but here it's the sum of the residues, not the sum modulo p.\n\nLet's think.\n\nThe sum S = sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} .\n\nSince p is prime, by Fermat's little theorem, k^{p-1} \u2261 1 mod p for k not divisible by p, but here the exponent is 2n, not p-1.\n\nThe sum sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{m} for m not divisible by p-1, this sum is divisible by p, because the map k -> k is a permutation, and if m not multiple of p-1, the sum is 0 mod p.\n\nMore precisely, if m is not a multiple of p-1, then sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{m} \u2261 0 mod p.\n\nThis is a standard result, since the multiplicative group is cyclic, and the sum of all m-th powers is 0 if m not divisible by p-1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut here, we have the sum of k^{2n}, which is a number, not modulo p.\n\nk^{2n} is large, so sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} is a large number, and we are interested in sum r_k, where r_k = k^{2n} mod p.\n\nSince k^{2n} \u2261 r_k mod p, and 0 \u2264 r_k < p, so k^{2n} = q_k p + r_k for some integer q_k, so sum k^{2n} = p sum q_k + sum r_k.\n\nTherefore, sum r_k = sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} - p sum q_k.\n\nNow, sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} is the sum of powers.\n\nFor large p, this sum is approximately integral of x^{2n} from 1 to p-1, but that might not help for exact value.\n\nSince sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} \u2261 0 mod p if p-1 does not divide 2n, which is usually the case.\n\nBut even if it does, we can handle it.\n\nBut in any case, sum r_k = sum k^{2n} - p A for some integer A, so sum r_k \u2261 sum k^{2n} mod p.\n\nAnd if p-1 does not divide 2n, then sum k^{2n} \u2261 0 mod p, so sum r_k \u2261 0 mod p.\n\nSince each r_k is between 1 and p-1, sum r_k is between p-1 and (p-1)^2, so if sum r_k \u2261 0 mod p, and 0 < sum r_k < p(p-1), so sum r_k is a multiple of p between p and p(p-2), so it could be p,2p, ..., up to (p-2)p or something.\n\nBut this is for the full sum from 1 to p-1.\n\nBut we need only from 1 to m.\n\nFirst, let's go back to our sum.\n\nRecall that for our mean, we have sum from k=1 to m of { k^{2n}/p } = (1/p) sum_{k=1}^m r_k, where r_k = k^{2n} mod p.\n\nAnd m = (p-1)/2.\n\nNow, the values k^{2n} mod p for k=1 to m are exactly the values that are quadratic residues? Not necessarily, because it's 2n-th powers, not squares.\n\nFor example, if 2n=2, it's squares, then for k=1 to m, it's the quadratic residues between 1 and (p-1)/2 or something.\n\nLet's consider the case when 2n is divisible by p-1 or not.\n\nBut p varies, so for most p, p-1 does not divide 2n, since n is fixed.\n\n2n is fixed, p-1 grows, so for p > 2n+1, p-1 does not divide 2n, since 2n < p-1 for large p.\n\nSimilarly, gcd(2n, p-1) can be various values.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the average of the fractional parts.\n\nAnother idea: the fractional part { k^{2n}/p } is the same as the fractional part when k^{2n} is divided by p, which depends on the residue.\n\nBut since k^{2n} mod p is periodic or something, but k is from 1 to p-1.\n\nNotice that for each k, { k^{2n}/p } = { r/p } where r is the residue, but r is between 1 and p-1.\n\nThe sum S = sum_{k=1}^m { k^{2n}/p } = sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{ r_k}{p}\n\nThe arithmetic mean is (1/m) S.\n\nBut S = (1/p) sum r_k.\n\nSo mean = (1/m) * (1/p) sum r_k = (2/(p-1)) * (1/p) sum r_k = 2 sum r_k / [p (p-1)]\n\nNow, sum r_k is the sum of the 2n-th powers modulo p for k=1 to m.\n\nAs I thought earlier, for the full sum from 1 to p-1, sum r_k = sum_{k=1}^{p-1} (k^{2n} mod p).\n\nAnd as above, sum r_k = sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} - p A for some A.\n\nAnd sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} is a polynomial in p of degree 2n+1, but it's sum from 1 to p-1 of k^{2n}, which is a polynomial of degree 2n+1 with rational coefficients.\n\nIn fact, sum_{k=1}^N k^{2n} = (1/(2n+1)) N^{2n+1} + (1/2) N^{2n} + lower terms, by Bernoulli polynomials or Faulhaber's formula.\n\nFor N = p-1, sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{2n} = (1/(2n+1)) (p-1)^{2n+1} + (1/2) (p-1)^{2n} + \\sum_{j=1}^{2n} c_j (p-1)^j for some coefficients c_j.\n\nBut this is messy, and we have to subtract p A.\n\nBut A is sum q_k, which is sum floor(k^{2n}/p), which is approximately (1/p) sum k^{2n} = (1/p) * [ (1/(2n+1)) (p-1)^{2n+1} + ... ] , but it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way.\n\nLet's consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^m { k^{2n}/p }.\n\nSince {x} = x - floor(x), so S = sum_{k=1}^m ( k^{2n}/p - floor(k^{2n}/p) ) = (1/p) sum_{k=1}^m k^{2n} - sum_{k=1}^m floor(k^{2n}/p)\n\nNow, the first term is (1/p) sum_{k=1}^m k^{2n}.\n\nThe second term is the sum of floor functions.\n\n floor(k^{2n}/p) is the number of multiples of p up to k^{2n}, but since k^{2n} is large, it's roughly k^{2n}/p.\n\nBut to be precise, for each k, floor(k^{2n}/p) = (k^{2n} - r_k)/p, where r_k = k^{2n} mod p.\n\nBut that's circular.\n\nI recall that for sums of floor functions, there are formulas involving the fractional parts, but it's tricky.\n\nAnother idea: the values k^{2n} mod p are uniformly distributed modulo p if the exponent is coprime to p-1, but here it's 2n, which may not be coprime.\n\nBut for the mean of fractional parts, if the values are uniformly distributed in 0 to 1, then the mean would be 1/2, but here it's not uniform because we're taking powers, and also only for k=1 to m.\n\nIn this case, for large p, if the map is random, then k^{2n} mod p is uniform, so { k^{2n}/p } is uniform on [0,1), so mean should be 1/2, but the problem says it's the same for infinitely many p, which might be different from 1/2, or perhaps it is 1/2, but for all p, it might not be exactly 1/2, but the problem says it's the same for infinitely many p, so perhaps for those p with the same gcd or something.\n\nPerhaps the mean depends only on d = gcd(2n, p-1).\n\nLet me try to compute the sum.\n\nLet d = gcd(2n, p-1).\n\nThen the image of the map k -> k^{2n} mod p has size (p-1)/d.\n\nFor each value in the image, it is taken by exactly d values of k in 1 to p-1.\n\nNow, when we sum over k=1 to m = (p-1)/2, how many times do we hit each value in the image?\n\nThe group (Z/pZ)* is cyclic, say generated by g.\n\nLet G = (Z/pZ)*, cyclic of order p-1.\n\nLet H be the subgroup of 2n-th powers, which is also the subgroup of d-th powers, since d = gcd(2n, p-1), and the map x -> x^{2n} has kernel of size d, image size (p-1)/d.\n\nThe values k^{2n} for k in G are exactly the elements of H, and each element of H is hit exactly d times as k runs through G.\n\nNow, when we sum over k=1 to m, which is half of G.\n\nSince G is cyclic, and m = (p-1)/2, the set {1,2, ..., m} is not necessarily a subgroup, but it is an interval.\n\nIn a cyclic group, the distribution of powers in an interval might be uniform if the interval is large, but here the interval is half the group, so it might be symmetric.\n\nFor a cyclic group of odd order, but p-1 is even since p odd prime, so order is even.\n\nThe set {1,2, ..., (p-1)/2} modulo p.\n\nThis set is not a subgroup, but it is symmetric in some way.\n\nNote that for each k in 1 to m, there is p-k in m+1 to p-1, and k^{2n} \u2261 (p-k)^{2n} mod p, as established earlier.\n\nSo the values k^{2n} for k=1 to p-1 are paired: for each k, k and p-k give the same value.\n\nAnd in the sum from k=1 to p-1, each value in the image is hit exactly d times, and since d may be even or odd, but the pairing is between k and p-k, which are different for k \u2260 p-k, i.e., when 2k \u2260 p, which is always true since p odd, so no fixed points.\n\nSo the values are 2-to-1 in the sense that each value is hit by a pair {k, p-k}, but since each value is hit d times, and d may vary.\n\nFor a fixed value y in the image, the number of k with k^{2n} \u2261 y mod p is d.\n\nThese k come in pairs if d is even, or there might be a k with 2k\u22610, but impossible, so all k come in distinct pairs {k, p-k}, and each such pair gives the same y.\n\nFor each pair {k, p-k}, they both give the same y = k^{2n} = (p-k)^{2n} mod p.\n\nAnd there are (p-1)/2 such pairs.\n\nEach pair corresponds to one y, but each y is hit by d values, so each y is hit by d/2 pairs? No.\n\nLet's think.\n\nThere are (p-1)/2 pairs of the form {k, p-k} for k=1 to m.\n\nEach pair  {k, p-k} gives the same value y_k = k^{2n} mod p.\n\nFor a fixed y, how many pairs give that y?\n\nSince each y is hit by d values of k, and these d values come in pairs because if k is a solution, so is p-k, and k \u2260 p-k, so the d values come in d/2 pairs, since d must be even? Not necessarily.\n\nFor example, if d is odd, then the solutions to k^{2n} \u2261 y mod p might not come in pairs, but since if k is a solution, so is p-k, and k \u2260 p-k, so the solutions come in pairs, so d must be even.\n\nIs that true?\n\nSuppose k is a solution to x^{2n} \u2261 y mod p.\n\nThen p-k is also a solution, as (p-k)^{2n} \u2261 (-k)^{2n} \u2261 k^{2n} \u2261 y mod p.\n\nAnd k \u2260 p-k since p odd.\n\nMoreover, if k is a solution, p-k is different.\n\nNow, is it possible that k = p-k? Only if 2k=p, impossible.\n\nSo the set of solutions is union of pairs {k, p-k}.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions d must be even, because they come in pairs.\n\nd is the number of solutions to x^{2n} \u2261 y mod p, for each y in the image.\n\nSince the group is cyclic, and the equation x^{2n} = y has solutions if y^{(p-1)/d} = 1, and then there are d solutions.\n\nBut in this case, for each y, the number of solutions is d, and since the solutions come in pairs {k, p-k}, and each pair has two distinct elements, so d must be divisible by 2, so d is even.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nFor example, take p=7, n=1, so 2n=2, d = gcd(2,6)=2.\n\nImage of x^2 mod 7: 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=2, 4^2=2, 5^2=4, 6^2=1, so values 1,4,2 each with multiplicity 2, d=2.\n\nPairs: {1,6} both give 1, {2,5} both give 4, {3,4} both give 2. Each y is hit by one pair, d=2.\n\nAnother example, p=13, n=1, 2n=2, d=gcd(2,12)=2.\n\nx^2 mod 13: 1,4,9,3,12,10,10,12,3,9,4,1? k=1 to 12: 1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16\u22613,5^2=25\u226112,6^2=36\u226110,7^2=49\u226110? 49-3*13=49-39=10, 8^2=64\u226112? 64-4*13=64-52=12,9^2=81\u22613? 81-6*13=81-78=3,10^2=100\u22619?100-7*13=100-91=9,11^2=121\u22614?121-9*13=121-117=4,12^2=144\u22611?144-11*13=144-143=1. So values: 1,4,9,3,12,10,10,12,3,9,4,1. So residues: 1,3,4,9,10,12 each appear twice. d=2.\n\nNow, suppose n=1, p=5, 2n=2, d=gcd(2,4)=2. x^2 mod 5:1,4,4,1, so 1 and 4, each twice.\n\nd=2 even.\n\nCan d be odd? Suppose p-1 divisible by 2n, but 2n even, p-1 even, but d=gcd(2n,p-1), if 2n divides p-1, then d=2n, which is even since n\u22651.\n\n2n is always even for n\u22651, since n integer, 2n even.\n\nn is positive integer, so 2n \u22652, even.\n\ngcd(2n,p-1) is always at least 2? No, gcd could be 1.\n\nFor example, p=3, n=1, 2n=2, p-1=2, d=gcd(2,2)=2.\n\np=7, n=1, d=2.\n\nBut suppose p=11, n=1, d=gcd(2,10)=2.\n\nWhen is d odd? But 2n is even, so gcd with p-1 could be odd only if 2n has odd divisor, but gcd is always a divisor of 2n, which is even, so d is always even for n\u22651.\n\n2n is even, so any divisor is even or odd? 2n could have odd divisors.\n\nFor example, n=1, 2n=2, divisors 1,2. d could be 1 or 2.\n\nd=1 if gcd(2,p-1)=1, i.e., p-1 odd, but p-1 even for p>2, so for p>2, p-1 even, so gcd(2,p-1) \u22652? No, gcd(2,p-1) is 1 if p-1 odd, but p-1 is always even for p>2, so gcd(2,p-1) \u22652? No, gcd(2, even number) is at least 2? For example p=3, p-1=2, gcd(2,2)=2. p=5, p-1=4, gcd(2,4)=2. p=7, p-1=6, gcd(2,6)=2. p=11, p-1=10, gcd(2,10)=2. Always 2 for n=1? But if n is larger.\n\nSuppose n=2, so 2n=4. p=5, p-1=4, d=gcd(4,4)=4. p=7, p-1=6, d=gcd(4,6)=2. p=11, p-1=10, d=gcd(4,10)=2. p=13, p-1=12, d=gcd(4,12)=4. All even.\n\nCan d be odd? Suppose d divides 2n, and 2n is even, so if d is odd, it must divide the odd part of 2n. But since 2n is even, d could be odd. For example, let n=3, 2n=6. p=7, p-1=6, d=gcd(6,6)=6 even. p=13, p-1=12, d=gcd(6,12)=6 even. p=19, p-1=18, d=gcd(6,18)=6 even. p=5, p-1=4, d=gcd(6,4)=2 even. p=11, p-1=10, d=gcd(6,10)=2 even. p=17, p-1=16, d=gcd(6,16)=2 even. p=31, p-1=30, d=gcd(6,30)=6 even. Seems always even. Why?\n\nSince p-1 is even, and 2n is even, but gcd could be odd. For example, suppose p-1 divisible by an odd number, but 2n also divisible by that odd number. For example, let n=1, 2n=2, but 2 has no odd divisors. Let n=2, 2n=4, divisors 1,2,4. d=1 if gcd(4,p-1)=1, but p-1\u22652 for p\u22653, and even, so gcd at least 2, so d\u22652. Similarly for any n, 2n \u22652, and p-1\u22652, even, so gcd(2n,p-1) \u22652? Not necessarily, if p-1 is not divisible by 2, but it is. Minimum gcd is 2 if 2 divides both, which it does. Since both even, gcd is at least 2. Yes, because 2 divides 2n and 2 divides p-1 for p>2, so gcd is at least 2, and since 2 is even, d is always even for p>2.\n\nSo d is always even.\n\nTherefore, for each y in the image, the number of solutions to x^{2n} \u2261 y mod p is d, and d is even, and solutions come in pairs {k, p-k}, so there are d/2 such pairs that give the same y.\n\nThe pairs are {1,p-1}, {2,p-2}, ..., {m, p-m} but p-m = p - (p-1)/2 = (p+1)/2, and m = (p-1)/2, so for k=1 to m, we have the first elements of each pair.\n\nThere are m = (p-1)/2 pairs: pair i for i=1 to m, consisting of i and p-i.\n\nFor each pair, both give the same value y_i = i^{2n} mod p.\n\nNow, for a fixed y, how many pairs give that y? Since each y is hit by d values of k, and each pair corresponds to two k's, so number of pairs that hit y is d/2.\n\nSince d is even, d/2 is integer.\n\nNow, the image has size |H| = (p-1)/d.\n\nEach y in H is hit by exactly d/2 pairs.\n\nNow, when we sum over k=1 to m, we sum over the first element of each pair, i.e., over i=1 to m, and for each i, we have r_i = y_i, the value for that pair.\n\nThe sum S = sum_{i=1}^m { i^{2n}/p } = sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{ y_i }{p}\n\nSince y_i is the residue for pair i.\n\nThe values y_i are exactly the values in H, but each y in H appears exactly d/2 times in the list y_1 to y_m, because there are d/2 pairs for each y.\n\nThe list y_i for i=1 to m: there are m = (p-1)/2 values, each y_i is in H, and since each y in H is represented by d/2 pairs, and each pair contributes one y_i (since we take one per pair), so each y in H appears exactly d/2 times in the sum.\n\nTherefore, sum_{i=1}^m y_i = sum_{y \\in H} (d/2) y = (d/2) sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nNow, H is the subgroup of d-th powers, since d = gcd(2n,p-1), and the d-th powers are the same as the 2n-th powers.\n\nIn the multiplicative group, H is the set of elements that are d-th powers.\n\nNow, sum_{y \\in H} y, where y is considered as integer between 1 and p-1.\n\nSince H is a subgroup, and the group is cyclic, the sum of all elements in a subgroup.\n\nIn a cyclic group of order m, the sum of elements in a subgroup of index k.\n\nSpecifically, G is cyclic of order p-1, H is subgroup of index d, since |H| = (p-1)/d, so index d.\n\nThe sum of all elements in G is sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k.\n\nSince G is cyclic, and H is a subgroup, the sum over H.\n\nNote that the elements of H are the solutions to x^{(p-1)/d} \u2261 1 mod p, but as integers.\n\nThe sum sum_{y \\in H} y.\n\nSince H is a subgroup, and G is cyclic, the sum can be computed.\n\nNote that the elements of H are equally spaced in some sense, but modulo p.\n\nFor example, if d=1, but d\u22652, so not.\n\nA standard result is that for a subgroup H of (Z/pZ)*, the sum of its elements is congruent to 0 mod p if H is proper, but not necessarily.\n\nFor example, p=7, H = {1,2,4} which are quadratic residues, sum 1+2+4=7\u22610 mod 7.\n\np=13, quadratic residues: 1,4,9,3,12,10? Earlier: 1,3,4,9,10,12, sum=1+3+4+9+10+12=39\u22610 mod 13? 13*3=39, yes.\n\nIs this always true?\n\nIn general, for the subgroup of d-th powers, which has index d, and since d \u22652 (for p>2), the subgroup is proper.\n\nIn a cyclic group of order m, the sum of elements in a subgroup of index k.\n\nThe sum is zero if the subgroup does not contain -1 or something? Not necessarily.\n\nSince the subgroup H is closed under multiplication, and if it contains -1, but not always.\n\nFor example, p=5, d=gcd(2n,p-1), say n=1, d=2, H = {1,4}, since 1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=4,4^2=1, so elements 1 and 4. Sum=5\u22610 mod 5.\n\np=11, n=1, d=2, quadratic residues:1,4,9,5,3? k=1,2,3,4,5:1,4,9\u2261 -2\u22619? 9, 16\u22615, 25\u22613, and k=6\u2261-5,36\u22613, same as 5? Earlier: values 1,3,4,5,5,9? List:1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16\u22615,5^2=25\u22613,6^2=36\u22613,7^2=49\u22615,8^2=64\u22619,9^2=81\u22614,10^2=100\u22611. So residues:1,3,4,5,9 each appear? 1 twice,3 twice,4 twice,5 twice,9 twice? From above:1,4,9,5,3,3,5,9,4,1. So distinct residues 1,3,4,5,9. Sum=1+3+4+5+9=22\u22610 mod 11.\n\nAnother example, p=17, n=1, d=2, quadratic residues: squares mod 17:1,4,9,16\u2261-1,16, 8^2=64\u226113, 7^2=49\u226115\u2261-2, better: 1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16,5^2=25\u22618,6^2=36\u22612,7^2=49\u226115,8^2=64\u226113,9^2^2=81\u226113? 81-4*17=81-68=13, 10^2=100\u226115?100-5*17=100-85=15,11^2=121\u22612?121-7*17=121-119=2,12^2=144\u22618?144-8*17=144-136=8,13^2=169\u226116?169-9*17=169-153=16,14^2=196\u22619?196-11*17=196-187=9,15^2=225\u22614? 225-13*17=225-221=4,16^2=256\u22611?256-15*17=256-255=1. So values:1,4,9,16,8,2,15,13,13,15,2,8,16,9,4,1. So distinct quadratic residues:1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16. Sum=1+2+4+8+9+13+15+16. Calculate:1+2+3? 1+2=3,+4=7,+8=15,+9=24,+13=37,+15=52,+16=68. Now 68 mod 17:17*4=68, so \u22610 mod 17.\n\nSo it seems that sum of quadratic residues is multiple of p.\n\nIn general, for the subgroup of d-th powers, sum of its elements is \u22610 mod p.\n\nWhy? Because the subgroup H is a group, and if it doesn't contain 0, and is proper, but sum may not be zero.\n\nIn the examples it is zero mod p.\n\nReason: the sum S = sum_{x \\in H} x.\n\nSince H is a subgroup, for any h in H, h S = sum_{x \\in H} h x.\n\nAs h runs through H, h x runs through H, so h S = S for each h in H.\n\nThus S (h - 1) \u2261 0 mod p for each h in H.\n\nIf H has more than one element, then unless S\u22610, this would imply that h-1 \u22610 for all h, contradiction.\n\nSince H has |H| = (p-1)/d \u22651, and for p>2, |H| \u2264 (p-1)/2 < p-1, so H is proper, so |H| \u22652? For p=3, |H|=(3-1)/d, d=gcd(2n,2), for n=1, d=2, |H|=1, only {1}, sum=1 not \u22610 mod 3? But earlier for p=3, n=1, d=2, H={1}, since only quadratic residue is 1. Sum=1, not divisible by 3? But in our earlier calculation for sum over k=1 to p-1, but here for the subgroup sum.\n\nFor p=3, |H|=1, only element 1, sum=1.\n\nBut in our case, for the mean, we need to see.\n\nIn this case, for p=3, m=(3-1)/2=1, k=1, {1^{2n}/3} = {1/3}=1/3.\n\nMean is 1/3.\n\nNow, for other primes, but p=3 is small.\n\nBut in general, when |H|>1, S \u22610 mod p.\n\nFor p=3, |H|=1, S=1 not \u22610.\n\nBut in our sum, for the fractional parts, it might be ok.\n\nBack to the sum.\n\nWe have sum_{i=1}^m y_i = (d/2) sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nNow, sum_{y \\in H} y \u2261 0 mod p if |H| >1, i.e., if (p-1)/d >1, i.e., p-1 > d.\n\nSince d = gcd(2n,p-1) \u2264 p-1, and for p > 2n+1, d \u2264 2n < p-1, so |H| = (p-1)/d >1, so sum_{y \\in H} y \u2261 0 mod p.\n\nMoreover, since each y is between 1 and p-1, sum y is at least 1+2+...+(|H|) = |H|(|H|+1)/2, and at most (p-1) + (p-2) + ... but since |H| elements, each \u2264 p-1, so sum, and since \u22610 mod p, and 0 < sum < |H| p, so sum is multiple of p, and since |H| \u22652, sum \u2265 1+2=3, so for p>3, sum \u22653 >0, so sum is at least p, and less than |H| p \u2264 (p-1)p / d < p^2, so sum = c p for some integer c with 1 \u2264 c \u2264 |H| -1 < p-1.\n\nBut anyway, sum_{y \\in H} y \u2261 0 mod p, so sum y = p B for some integer B.\n\nTherefore, sum_{i=1}^m y_i = (d/2) p B\n\nNow, recall that S = sum_{k=1}^m { k^{2n}/p } = sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{ y_k }{p} = \\frac{1}{p} sum_{k=1}^m y_k = \\frac{1}{p} \\cdot (d/2) p B = (d/2) B\n\nSince the p cancels.\n\nSo S = \\frac{d}{2} B\n\nNow, B is an integer, as above.\n\nNow, the arithmetic mean is \\frac{1}{m} S = \\frac{1}{(p-1)/2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{2} B = \\frac{2}{p-1} \\cdot \\frac{d}{frac{2} B} = \\frac{d B}{p-1}\n\nBut d = gcd(2n, p-1), and p-1 is in the denominator.\n\nNow, since d | p-1, let p-1 = d m, but m here is different.\n\nSet e = p-1.\n\nThen d = gcd(2n, e), and mean = \\frac{d B}{e}\n\nB depends on p, or on e.\n\nWhat is B? B = \\frac{1}{p} sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nSince sum y \u22610 mod p, B is integer.\n\nB = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nH is the subgroup of d-th powers, and |H| = e / d, since e = p-1, |H| = e / d.\n\nThe sum \\sum_{y \\in H} y is the sum of the d-th powers modulo p, but as integers.\n\nSince the elements are symmetric or something.\n\nNote that the set H is a complete set of residues modulo |H| or something, but not necessarily.\n\nIn the cyclic group, the subgroup of index d consists of elements that are constant on the cosets, but sum might be computable.\n\nSince H is a subgroup, and the sum is over H, and we have that B = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\mathbf{1}_{x \\in H} x\n\nBut \\mathbf{1}_{x \\in H} is 1 if x is a d-th power residue.\n\nBut perhaps we can write it as a character sum.\n\nRecall that the indicator function of H can be written using characters.\n\nSpecifically, since G is cyclic, the characters are multiplicative characters.\n\nThe subgroup H of index d is the kernel of the quotient map to G/H, which is cyclic of order d.\n\nThe sum \\sum_{x \\in G} \\mathbf{1}_H (x) x\n\n\\mathbf{1}_H (x) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{\\chi} \\chi(x) where the sum is over characters \u03c7 that are trivial on H, i.e., characters of order dividing d.\n\nMore precisely, the characters that are trivial on H correspond to characters of G/H, which has order d, so there are d such characters.\n\nThe principal character and others.\n\nThe sum \\sum_{x \\in G} \\mathbf{1}_H (x) x = \\sum_{x \\in G} \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{\\chi} \\chi(x) x\n\nWhere \u03c7 runs over characters of G that are trivial on H, i.e., characters of order dividing d.\n\nSince G is multiplicative, and we are summing over x, which are residues.\n\nSo \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\mathbf{1}_H (x) x = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{\\chi} \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) x\n\nFor the principal character \u03c7_0, \\sum_{x} \\chi_0(x) x = \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} x = \\cdot \\frac{p(p-1)}{2}\n\nFor non-principal characters \u03c7, the sum \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) x is a Gauss sum or something.\n\nIn general, for a non-principal character \u03c7, \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x is bounded, but actually, it can be computed.\n\nI recall that \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) e^{2\\pi i a x / p} is a Gauss sum, but here it's without exponential, just \u03c7(x) x.\n\nSo it's \\sum \\chi(x) x.\n\nThis is similar to the Jacobi sum or something.\n\nNote that \\sum_{x=0}^{p-1} \\chi(x) x, but \u03c7(0) is usually undefined, so we sum from 1 to p-1.\n\nSet S(\u03c7) = \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) x\n\nFor \u03c7 non-principal, this sum can be evaluated.\n\nI recall that for \u03c7 non-principal, |S(\u03c7)| \u2264 \\sqrt{p} or something, but actually, it can be computed exactly.\n\nNote that \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) (x) = \\chi(-1) \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) (p - x) if we change variable, but not helpful.\n\nA standard result is that S(\u03c7) = - \\frac{\\tau(\\chi,1)}{ \\overline{\\chi}(1) } or something, but complicated.\n\nI recall that \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x = - \\tau(\\chi) if \u03c7 is primitive, but \u03c4(\u03c7) is the Gauss sum.\n\nThe Gauss sum is g(\u03c7) = \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) e^{2\\pi i x / p}\n\nThen \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x is related to the derivative or something.\n\nNote that \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) x = \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) \\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} k \\delta_{x,k} , not helpful.\n\nAnother way: since the characters are multiplicative, and x is additive, but in finite fields, such sums can be bounded.\n\nBut for our purpose, perhaps we don't need the exact value.\n\nBack to the mean.\n\nWe have mean = \\frac{d B}{e} where e = p-1, d = gcd(2n, e), and B = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nNow, \\sum_{y \\in H} y is an integer between 1 and (p-1)|H|, and since |H| = e / d, and e = p-1, so |H| = (p-1)/d.\n\nAnd as we saw, \\sum y \u2261 0 mod p, so B is integer, and 1 \u2264 B \u2264 |H| - 1 < |H| = (p-1)/d\n\nSince sum y \u2265 1+2+...+ |H| = |H|(|H|+1)/2, and |H| \u22652 for p>3, so B \u2265 \\frac{ |H|(|H|+1) }{2p} \n\nSimilarly, upper bound.\n\nBut mean = d B / e\n\ne = p-1, d | e, so d/e = d / (p-1)\n\nBut B depends on p.\n\nThe key point is that for primes p such that gcd(2n, p-1) = d is fixed, and p-1 is multiple of d, but d is fixed, but p-1 varies.\n\nd = gcd(2n, p-1), so for different p, d can be different.\n\nBut if we fix d, and require that gcd(2n, p-1) = d, then d | 2n, since d | 2n, and d | p-1.\n\nMoreover, for such p, the mean might be the same.\n\nIn the expression mean = d B / (p-1)\n\nB = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nH is the subgroup of d-th powers.\n\nFor a fixed d, and for primes p such that gcd(2n, p-1) = d, which implies that d | 2n, and that the multiplicative order modulo d or something.\n\nCondition gcd(2n, p-1) = d means that d | p-1, and d | 2n, and that gcd(2n / d, (p-1)/d) = 1.\n\nThat is, 2n / d and (p-1)/d are coprime.\n\nNow, for such p, |H| = (p-1)/d\n\nNow, sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nH is cyclic of order m = (p-1)/d\n\nSince it's a subgroup of (Z/pZ)*, cyclic of order m.\n\nThe elements of H can be written as g^{k d} for k=0 to m-1, where g is a primitive root modulo p.\n\ng^{k d} for k=0,1,...,m-1, and since g^m = g^{(p-1)/d} has order d, and the elements are distinct.\n\nNow, sum_{y \\in H} y = sum_{k=0}^{m-1} g^{k d} \\pmod{p}, but as integers, it's the representative.\n\nSo sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (g^{k d} \\mod p)\n\nWhere the representative is chosen between 1 and p-1.\n\nThis sum depends on the primitive root g, but since the sum is symmetric, it might be independent of g.\n\nNote that the set { g^{k d} \\mod p \\mid k=0,1,...,m-1} is just the set of d-th powers, which is independent of g.\n\nBut the sum as integers depends on the representatives.\n\nHowever, since the sum is congruent to 0 modulo p, as we established, and in fact, for the fractional part sum, we already have S = (d/2) B, and mean = d B / (p-1)\n\nBut B = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum y, and \\sum y is the sum of the d-th powers.\n\nTo make mean constant, we need that for fixed d, and for primes with gcd(2n,p-1)=d, the mean is the same.\n\nBut mean = d B / (p-1)\n\np-1 = d m, where m = (p-1)/d, so mean = d B / (d m) = B / m\n\nSince m = (p-1)/d\n\nNow B = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\n\\sum_{y \\in H} y is the sum of the d-th power residues.\n\nB / m = \\frac{1}{m p} \\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{d}{p (p-1)} \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nBut\n\nmean = B / m\n\nm = |H| = (p-1)/d\n\nB is integer, and mean = B / m\n\nm depends on p, so for mean to be constant, B must be proportional to m.\n\nBut m changes with p, so unless B is proportional to m, which may not be.\n\nBut for fixed d, and fixed n, but n is fixed, d is fixed, but m varies with p.\n\nIn mean = B / m, and B and m depend on p.\n\nBut perhaps for primes with the same m, but m = (p-1)/d, so p = d m + 1, so for fixed d fixed m, p is determined, but we need infinitely many p.\n\nFor fixed d, as p varies with gcd(2n,p-1)=d, then m = (p-1)/d varies.\n\nNow, mean = B / m\n\nB = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\n\\sum_{y \\in H} y is approximately the sum of |H| numbers each about p/2, so sum about |H| p / 2, so B about |H| / 2 = m / 2, so mean about (m/2)/m = 1/2, which makes sense.\n\nBut for it to be constant, we need B / m to be constant.\n\nBut B / m = \\frac{1}{m p} \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nThe sum \\sum_{y \\in H} y can be expressed as the sum over the d-th powers.\n\nSince the d-th powers are uniformly distributed modulo p, for large p, the average should be about p/2, so B \u2248 (m p / 2) / p = m/2, so mean \u2248 1/2.\n\nBut for it to be exactly constant for infinitely many p, perhaps it is 1/2, but for small p it's not, as in p=3, mean=1/3.\n\nBut for larger p with fixed d, it may vary.\n\nPerhaps for fixed d, and fixed n, the mean depends only on d and n, not on p, for such p.\n\nBut from mean = B / m, and B depends on p, so probably not.\n\nUnless B is proportional to m.\n\nBut from the character sum, we can find B.\n\nRecall that \\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\mathbf{1}_H (x) x = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{\\chi} \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x\n\nWhere \u03c7 runs over characters of order dividing d.\n\n\\sum_{\\chi} S(\\chi) where S(\\chi) = \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) x\n\nFor \u03c7 principal, S(\u03c7_0) = \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} x = \\frac{p(p-1)}{2}\n\nFor \u03c7 non-principal, S(\u03c7) = \\sum \\chi(x) x\n\nNow, this sum is known to be related to the Gauss sum.\n\nI recall that for a non-principal character \u03c7, |S(\u03c7)| \u2264 \\sqrt{p} (p-1) or something, but actually it can be bounded.\n\nA standard result is that S(\u03c7) = - \\tau(\\chi) \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\bar{\\chi}(k) k or something, but it's messy.\n\nNote that \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x = \\chi(-1) \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) (p - x) = \\chi(-1) p \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) - \\chi(-1) \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x\n\nSo \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x = \\chi(-1) p \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) - \\chi(-1) \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x\n\nThus [1 + \\chi(-1)] \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x = \\chi(-1) p \\sum_{x} \\chi(x)\n\nNow, \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\chi(x) = 0 for \u03c7 non-principal, since it's the sum of a non-principal character over the group.\n\nSo if \u03c7(-1) = 1, then 2 \\sum \\chi(x) x = 0, so \\sum \\chi(x) x = 0\n\nIf \u03c7(-1) = -1, then [1 + (-1)] \\sum = 0, which is always true, so no information.\n\nFor characters with \u03c7(-1) = 1, S(\u03c7) = 0.\n\nFor those with \u03c7(-1) = -1, it may not be zero.\n\nIn our case, the characters \u03c7 that are trivial on H, i.e., order dividing d.\n\n\u03c7(-1) = 1 if -1 is a d-th power modulo p, which depends on p.\n\nSpecifically, -1 is a d-th power iff (-1)^{(p-1)/d} = 1, since the order of -1 is 2, so if 2 divides (p-1)/d, i.e., if (p-1)/d is even, i.e., if m is even.\n\nOtherwise, if m odd, then -1 is not a d-th power, so \u03c7(-1) = -1 for all \u03c7 that are non-principal and trivial on H.\n\nThe characters \u03c7 of order dividing d correspond to characters of the quotient group, which has order d.\n\nThe principal character has \u03c7(-1) =1.\n\nOther characters may have \u03c7(-1) = \u00b11.\n\nIn the sum, \\sum_{\\chi} S(\\chi) = S(\\chi_0) + \\sum_{\\chi \\neq \\chi_0} S(\\chi)\n\nS(\\chi_0) = \\frac{p(p-1)}{2}\n\nFor non-principal \u03c7, if \u03c7(-1) =1, S(\u03c7)=0.\n\nIf \u03c7(-1) = -1, S(\u03c7) may not be zero.\n\nThe number of such \u03c7 depends on whether -1 is in H.\n\nBut for our purpose, perhaps we can write.\n\nSo \\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{1}{d} \\left[ \\frac{p(p-1)}{2} + \\sum_{\\chi \\neq \\chi_0} S(\\chi) \\right]\n\nWhere the sum is over non-principal characters of order dividing d.\n\nFor each such \u03c7, if \u03c7(-1)=1, S(\u03c7)=0, so only when \u03c7(-1)=-1, S(\u03c7) contributes.\n\nThe characters with \u03c7(-1)=-1 are those for which the order is odd or something, but it's complicated.\n\nNote that S(\u03c7) for \u03c7 non-principal is bounded by C \\sqrt{p} for some C, by Polya-Vinogradov or something.\n\n| \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) x | \u2264 \\ | \\sum_{x} \\chi(x) | \\max |x| but not helpful.\n\nActually, it's known that |S(\u03c7)| \u2264 \\sqrt{p} \\log p or something, but for simplicity, |S(\u03c7)| = O(\\sqrt{p}) as p\u2192\u221e.\n\nIn fact, for primitive characters, |S(\u03c7)| = \\sqrt{p} |L(1,\\chi)| or something, but bounded.\n\nSo \\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{1}{d} \\left[ \\frac{p(p-1)}{2} + O(\\sqrt{p} \\cdot d) \\right] since there are at most d characters, each S(\u03c7) = O(\\sqrt{p})\n\nThe number of non-principal characters is d-1, and for each, |S(\u03c7)| \u2264 C \\sqrt{p} for some constant C depending on d or n, but d is fixed, so C can be fixed for fixed d.\n\nActually, the constant may depend on the character, but since there are finitely many characters for fixed d, and each is fixed, but as p varies, the character depends on p, so it's not fixed.\n\nThe characters are defined modulo p, so for different p, they are different, so the bound |S(\u03c7)| may not be uniform.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nFor a fixed character order, the sum can be bounded.\n\nBut to be precise, for our purpose, we have B = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{1}{p} \\cdot \\frac{1}{d} \\left[ \\frac{p(p-1)}{2} + O(\\sqrt{p}) \\right] = \\frac{1}{d} \\left[ \\frac{p-1}{2} + O(p^{-1/2}) \\right]\n\nThe O(\\sqrt{p}) term divided by p is O(p^{-1/2}), so B = \\frac{p-1}{2d} + O(p^{-1/2})\n\nThen mean = B / m = B / ( (p-1)/d ) = \\frac{ B d }{p-1}\n\nNow B = \\frac{p-1}{2d} + O(p^{-1/2})\n\nSo mean = \\frac{ d }{p-1} \\left( \\frac{p-1}{2d} + O(p^{-1/2}) \\right) = \\frac{d}{p-1} \\cdot \\frac{p-1}{2d} + \\frac{d}{p-1} O(p^{-1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + O( p^{-1/2} )\n\nAs p\u2192\u221e, for fixed d, the mean approaches 1/2.\n\nBut this is asymptotic, and for large p, it's close to 1/2, but the problem asks for exactly the same for infinitely many p.\n\nMoreover, for small p, it may be different.\n\nBut in the expression, the mean is B/m, and B is integer, m is integer, so mean is rational, and for large p, close to 1/2, so perhaps for those p where the error is small, but we need exactly the same.\n\nPerhaps for primes p such that p\u22611 mod d, and gcd(2n/d, (p-1)/d)=1, and also that -1 is a d-th power or something, so that the sum S(\u03c7)=0 for all non-principal \u03c7, then B = \\frac{1}{d} \\frac{p(p-1)}{2} / p = \\frac{p-1}{2d}\n\nThen mean = B / m = \\frac{p-1}{2d} / \\frac{p-1}{d} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\nSo if all non-principal characters with order dividing d have \u03c7(-1)=1, which implies S(\u03c7)=0, then mean =1/2.\n\nThis happens when for all such \u03c7, \u03c7(-1)=1, which means that -1 is in the kernel of all such \u03c7, i.e., -1 is a d-th power modulo p.\n\nAs earlier, -1 is a d-th power iff (-1)^{(p-1)/d} =1, iff (p-1)/d is even, i.e., m is even.\n\nSo if m is even, then mean =1/2.\n\nBut m = (p-1)/d, so if (p-1)/d is even, then mean=1/2.\n\nOtherwise, it may be different.\n\nBut for the mean to be the same, perhaps it is always 1/2 when possible, but for p=3, n=1, d=2, m=(3-1)/2=1, odd, mean=1/3 \u22601/2.\n\nFor p=5, n=1, d=2, m=(5-1)/2=2, even, then should be 1/2.\n\nCompute: k=1,2 (since m=2), k^{2} /5: k=1, 1/5, frac=0.2, k=2,4/5=0.8, sum frac=0.2+0.8=1, mean=1/2=0.5, yes.\n\nFor p=7, n=1, d=2, m=3, odd. Quadratic residues for k=1,2,3: 1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9\u22612 mod7, so frac parts: 1/7\u22480.1429, 4/7\u22480.5714, 2/7\u22480.2857, sum\u22480.1429+0.5714+0.2857=1.0000? 1/7+4/7+2/7=7/7=1, so sum=1, mean=1/3\u22480.333, not 1/2.\n\nBut according to above, if m odd, not necessarily 1/2.\n\nIn this case mean=1/3.\n\nFor p=13, n=1, d=2, m=6, even. k=1 to 6, squares mod13:1,4,9,3,12,10? Earlier:1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16\u22613,5^2=25\u226112,6^2=36\u226110. Frac parts:1/13,4/13,9/13,3/13,12/13,10/13. Sum= (1+4+9+3+12+10)/13 = 39/13=3, so sum=3, mean=3/6=0.5, yes.\n\nFor p=11, n=1, d=2, m=5, odd. k=1 to5, squares:1,4,9\u2261 -2\u22619?9,16\u22615,25\u22613, so 1,4,9,5,3. Frac:1/11,4/11,9/11,5/11,3/11. Sum= (1+4+9+5+3)/11=22/11=2, mean=2/5=0.4.\n\nNot 1/2.\n\nNow, for fixed n, say n=1, we have for different p, mean is 1/2 when (p-1)/2 is even, i.e., p\u22611 mod 4, and 1/3,1/5,2/5, etc otherwise.\n\nBut the problem is to show it's the same for infinitely many p, which for n=1, when p\u22611 mod 4, mean=1/2, and there are infinitely many such primes by Dirichlet, since 4 and 1 coprime.\n\nFor p\u22613 mod 4, mean is not 1/2, but varies, like for p=3,1/3; p=7,1/3; p=11,2/5=0.4; p=19, n=1, d=2, m=9, odd. k=1 to9, squares mod19:1,4,9,16,6,17,11,7,5? Compute:1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16,5^2=25\u22616,6^2=36\u226117,7^2=49\u226111,8^2=64\u22617 (64-3*19=64-57=7),9^2=81\u22615 (81-4*19=81-76=5). Sum frac= (1+4+9+16+6+17+11+7+5)/19. Sum numerator:1+4=5,+9=14,+16=30,+6=36,+17=53,+11=64,+7=71,+5=76. 76/19=4, so sum=4, mean=4/9\u22480.444.\n\nDifferent from previous.\n\nBut for p\u22611 mod 4, mean=1/2 for n=1.\n\nNow for other n.\n\nSuppose n=3, 2n=6.\n\nd=gcd(6,p-1).\n\nFor example, p=13, p-1=12, d=gcd(6,12)=6.\n\nm=(13-1)/2=6.\n\nH is 6th powers,6th powers mod13.\n\nSince d=6, |H|=(13-1)/6=2.\n\n6th powers: since (Z/13Z)* cyclic order 12, 6th powers are elements with x^{6}\u22611? Order dividing 6.\n\nElements: g^k for k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,... but g primitive, say g=2, 2^0=1,2^6\u2261 (2^6=64\u226112\u2261-1? 64-5*13=64-65=-1\u226112), better: order 12, elements of order dividing 6: solutions to x^6\u22611 mod13.\n\nx^6 -1=0, (x^3-1)(x^3+1)=0, so x^3\u22611 or x^3\u2261-1.\n\nx^3\u22611: x=1,3,9 (since 3^3=27\u22611? 26=2*13,27-26=1, yes; 1,3,9? 9^3=729, 13*56=728,729-728=1. Also 3^3=27\u22611, etc. Solutions to x^3\u22611: since cyclic, elements with order dividing 3: 1,3,9? 1^3=1,3^3=27\u22611,9^3=729\u22611? 13*56=728, yes. Also 10? 10^3=1000,13*76=988,1000-988=12\u22601. So 1,3,9.\n\nx^3\u2261 -1\u226112: x=2, since 8\u22618\u226012, 2^3=8, 8\u226012. 4^3=64\u226112?64-5*13=64-65=-1\u226112, yes. 5^3=125\u2261125-9*13=125-117=8\u226012. 6^3=216\u2261216-16*13=216-208=8\u226012. 7^3=343\u2261343-26*13=343-338=5\u226012. 8^3=512\u2261512-39*13=512-507=5\u226012. 10^3=1000\u22611000-76*13=1000-988=12\u2261-1, yes. 11^3=1331\u22611331-102*13=1331-1326=5\u226012. 12^3=1728\u22611728-132*13=1728-1716=12\u2261-1. So x=4,10,12.\n\nSo 6th powers are solutions to x^6\u22611, which are 1,3,9,4,10,12. But |H| should be (p-1)/d=12/6=2. Contradiction.\n\nd=gcd(2n,p-1)=gcd(6,12)=6, |H|= (p-1)/d=12/6=2.\n\nBut above I have six elements satisfying x^6\u22611. Mistake.\n\nx^{6} \u22611 mod p means that the order divides 6.\n\nThe subgroup of elements of order dividing 6 has size gcd(6,p-1)=gcd(6,12)=6, yes, but H is the image of x^{2n}=x^6, not the kernel.\n\nI confused.\n\nH is the set of values that are 2n-th powers, i.e., { y | y = x^{6} for some x}, so the image of the map x -> x^6.\n\nSince the group has order 12, map x -> x^6, kernel has size gcd(6,12)=6, so image has size 12/6=2.\n\nWhat are the 6th powers? Since the group is cyclic, the image is { g^{6k} for k}, but since g^{12}=1, so g^0=1, g^6, g^{12}=1, so only two elements: 1 and g^6.\n\ng primitive, g^6 has order 2, since (g^6)^2=g^{12}=1, so H = {1, g^6}.\n\nFor p=13, g=2, 2^6=64\u226112\u2261 -1 mod13.

Since each residue appears, and sum of all residues is 31*30/2=465, and each quadratic residue appears twice in the sum over k, so sum_{k=1}^{30} k^{2} = 2 \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nBut sum_{k=1}^{30} k^{2} is a number, not mod p.\n\nk^{2} mod p is the residue, but sum of residues r_k.\n\nFrom earlier, sum_{k=1}^{p-1} r_k = sum k^{2n} - p A\n\nFor n=1, sum_{k=1}^{30} k^2 = \\frac{30*31*61}{6} = 30/6=5, 5*31*61=5*1891=9455\n\nNow modulo 31, but we need the sum of r_k, where r_k = k^2 mod 31.\n\nSince k^2 \u2261 r_k mod  mod 31, and 0\u2264r_k<31, so sum r_k = sum k^2 - 31 A for some A.\n\nsum k^2 =9455, divisible by 31? 31*305=31*300=9300,31*5=155, total 9455, yes 31*305=9455, so sum k^2 =31*305, so sum r_k =31*305 -31 A =31(305-A)\n\nBut also, since each quadratic residue y appears twice in the sum r_k, so sum_{k=1}^{30} r_k = 2 \\sum_{y \\in H} y\n\nSo 2 sum_{y \\in H} y =31(305-A)\n\nThus sum_{y \\in H} y = \\frac{31}{2} (305-A)\n\nBut sum y is integer, so 31/2 times integer, so 31 must divide the integer, but 31 odd, so 305-A must be even, and sum y = 31 * \\frac{305-A}{2}\n\nSo B = sum y / p = \\frac{31 * k}{31} = k, where k= \\frac{305-A}{2}\n\nFrom above, sum y = 31 * \\frac{305-A}{2}\n\nBut for |H|=15, sum y should be around 15*15.5 or something, but anyway, B is integer, as expected.\n\nTo find A, sum floor(k^2 /31)\n\nFor k=1 to30, k^2 /31, floor when k^2 <31, k=1 to5, k^2=1,4,9,16,25 <31, floor=0\n\nk=6,36>31,36/31=1+5/31, floor=1\n\nk=7,49>31,49/31=1+18/31, floor=1\n\nk=8,64/31=2+2/31? 31*2=62,64-62=2, so floor=2\n\nSimilarly, k=9,81/31=2+19/31? 31*2=62,81-62=19, floor=2\n\nk=10,100/31=3+7/31?31*3=93,100-93=7, floor=3\n\nk=11,121/31=3+28/31?31*3=93,121-93=28, floor=3\n\nk=12,144/31=4+20/31?31*4=124,144-124=20, floor=4\n\nk=13,169/31=5+14/31?31*5=155,169-155=14, floor=5? 31*5=155<169,31*6=186>169, so 169-155=14, yes floor=5\n\nk=14,196/31=6+10/31?31*6=186,196-186=10, floor=6\n\nk=15,225/31=7+8/31?31*7=217,225-217=8, floor=7\n\nk=16,256/31=8+8/31?31*8=248,256-248=8, floor=8\n\nk=17,289/31=9+10/31?31*9=279,289-279=10, floor=9\n\nk=18,324/31=10+14/31?31*10=310,324-310=14, floor=10\n\nk=19,361/31=11+20/31?31*11=341,361-341=20, floor=11\n\nk=20,400/31=12+28/31?31*12=372,400-372=28, floor=12\n\nk=21,441/31=14+7/31?31*14=434,441-434=7, floor=14\n\nk=22,484/31=15+19/31?31*15=465,484-465=19, floor=15\n\nk=23,529/31=17+2/31?31*17=527,529-527=2, floor=17\n\nk=24,576/31=18+18/31?31*18=558,576-558=18, floor=18\n\nk=25,625/31=20+5/31?31*20=620,625-620=5, floor=20\n\nk=26,676/31=21+25/31?31*21=651,676-651=25, floor=21\n\nk=27,729/31=23+16/31?31*23=713,729-713=16, floor=23\n\nk=28,784/31=25+9/31?31*25=775,784-775=9, floor=25\n\nk=29,841/31=27+4/31?31*27=837,841-837=4, floor=27\n\nk=30,900/31=29+1/31?31*29=899,900-899=1, floor=29\n\nNow sum floor: k=1-5:0\n\nk=6,7:1+1=2\n\nk=8,9:2+2=4\n\nk=10,11:3+3=6\n\n6-11: k=6,7,8,9,10,11: floors 1,1,2,2,3,3 sum=1+1+2+2+3+3=12\n\nk=12:4, k=13:5, sum+9\n\nList: k1:0,k2:0,k3:0,k4:0,k5:0,k6:1,k7:1,k8:2,k9:2,k10:3,k11:3,k12:4,k13:5,k14:6,k15:7,k16:8,k17:9,k18:10,k19:11,k20:12,k21:14,k22:15,k23:17,k24:18,k25:20,k26:21,k27:23,k28:25,k29:27,k30:29\n\nSum: group or calculate.\n\n0 for k=1-5: sum0\n\nk6-7:1+1=2\n\nk8-9:2+2=4\n\nk10-11:3+3=6\n\nk12:4\n\nk13:5\n\nk14:6\n\nk15:7\n\nk16:8\n\nk17:9\n\nk18:10\n\nk19:11\n\nk20:12\n\nk21:14\n\nk22:15\n\nk23:17\n\nk24:18\n\nk25:20\n\nk26:21\n\nk27:23\n\nk28:25\n\nk29:27\n\nk30:29\n\nNow sum: let's add sequentially.\n\nStart with 0.\n\nk6:1, total1\n\nk7:1, total2\n\nk8:2, total4\n\nk9:2, total6\n\nk10:3, total9\n\nk11:3, total12\n\nk12:4, total16\n\nk13:5, total21\n\nk14:6, total27\n\nk15:7, total34\n\nk16:8, total42\n\nk17:9, total51\n\nk18:10, total61\n\nk19:11, total72\n\nk20:12, total84\n\nk21:14, total98\n\nk22:15, total113\n\nk23:17, total130\n\nk24:18, total148\n\nk25:20, total168\n\nk26:21, total189\n\nk27:23, total212\n\nk28:25, total237\n\nk29:27, total264\n\nk30:29, total293\n\nSo sum floor =293\n\nThen sum r_k = sum k^2 - p sum floor = 9455 - 31*293\n\n31*293=31*300-31*7=9300-217=9083\n\n9455-9083=372\n\nThen sum_{y \\in H} y = (1/2) sum r_k = 372 / 2 = 186, since each y appears twice.\n\n186 / 31 =6, since 31*6=186, so B=6.\n\nThen for the mean of fractional parts for k=1 to m=15.\n\nBut we need only up to (p-1)/2=15.\n\nNow sum S = sum_{k=1}^{15} { k^2 /31 } = sum r_k /31 for k=1 to15, but r_k is the residue for k^2, which is the same as for the pair.\n\nFrom earlier, sum_{i=1}^m y_i = (d/2) sum_{y \\in H} y = (2/2) * 186 = 186? d=2, d/2=1, sum y in H=186, so sum y_i =1*186=186\n\nThen S = sum frac = (1/p) sum y_i =186/31=6\n\nThen mean = S / M =6 /15=0.4\n\nB=6, k=|H|=15, mean=B/k=6/15=0.4\n\nNow, is this constant for fixed d? d=2 for n=1.\n\nFor different p with d=2, i.e., p odd prime, since d=gcd(2,p-1)=2 for p>2.\n\nFor p=5,=2.5/2?

So for d=3, there are no primes in this set, but that's fine.\n\nSimilarly for d=1.\n\nSo for each such d with v_2(d)=1, and for primes p with gcd(2n,p-1)=d, and (p-1)/d even, and gcd(2n/d, (p-1)/d)=1, then mean=1/2.\n\nAnd since for fixed n, there are finitely many such d (divisors of 2n with v_2(d)=1), and for each d, the set of p is defined by congruence conditions, and by Dirichlet, there are infinitely many such primes, as long as the modulus is coprime, which it is.\n\nFor example, for each d, the conditions are p\u22611 mod d, and p\u22611 mod 4? But (p-1)/d even, and gcd(f,m)=1 with f=2n/d.\n\nSince f is fixed for fixed d and n, and gcd(f,m)=1 is equivalent to p not congruent to certain values modulo the prime factors of f.\n\nSince f is odd (as v_2(d)=1), and the conditions are congruence conditions modulo some modulus, and since the density is positive, infinitely many primes.\n\nMoreover, for all such p, the mean is exactly 1/2.\n\nIn the case where |H|=1, like p=3, but for p=3, n=1, d=2, m=1 odd, and we didn't include it, but for larger p, |H|>1.\n\nSo for infinitely many primes, the mean is 1/2.\n\nBut is it always 1/2? For example, in p=11, n=1, mean=0.4<0.5, but for other p with same n, it can be 0.5.\n\nBut the problem says \"the same\", but not necessarily 1/2; it could be different for different n, but for fixed n, it should be the same for infinitely many p.\n\nIn this case, for each fixed n, and for primes in the set above, mean=1/2.\n\nMoreover, for different d, but all give mean=1/2.\n\nSo for infinitely many primes, the mean is 1/2.\n\nBut is it the same? Yes, always 1/2 for those primes.\n\nNow, what about when n is fixed, but for primes not in this set, mean may be different, but we only need infinitely many where it is the same.\n\nMoreover, for those primes, it is indeed the same, namely 1/2.\n\nTo confirm, for p=3, n=1, but p=3 small, and not in the set since for d=2, m=(3-1)/2=1 odd, not even.\n\nBut for p=5, n=1, d=2, m=2 even, and p\u22611 mod 4? 5\u22611 mod 4, yes, mean=1/2.\n\np=13, n=1, d=2, m=6 even, p\u22611 mod 4, mean=1/2.\n\np=17, n=1, d=2, m=8 even, p\u22611 mod 4, quadratic residues:1,4,9,16,8,2,15,13? Sum should be multiple of p? |H|=8, sum y, B=sum y /p, mean=B/8.\n\nBut since m even, mean=1/2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFor n=3, p=13, d=6, m=2 even, mean=1/2.\n\np=37, say, d=6? gcd(6,36)=6, p=37\u22611 mod 12? 37-36=1, yes, so should be mean=1/2.\n\nm=(37-1)/2=18.\n\n|H|=(37-1)/d=36/6=6.\n\nSum S = sum_{k=1}^{18} \\{ k^{6} /37 \\}\n\nBut since mean should be 1/2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, for any fixed odd positive integer n, there are infinitely many primes p (specifically, those satisfying the form above) such that the arithmetic mean is 1/2.\n\nAnd it is the same for all such primes.\n\nSo the proof is complete.\n",

Writing \\(d=\\gcd(2n,p-1)\\) and letting \\(H\\) be the subgroup of \\(d\\)th-powers in \\((\\Bbb Z/p)^{\\times}\\), it shows that each \\(y\\in H\\) occurs exactly \\(d/2\\) times among the \\(r_k\\).  Hence the mean equals \\(\\frac1{pk}\\sum_{y\\in H}y\\), where \\(k=|H|=(p-1)/d\\).  Under congruence conditions on \\(p\\) (in particular forcing \\(v_2(d)=1\\), \\(m_k\\) even and \\(\\gcd(2n/d,(p-1)/d)=1\\)), character-sum arguments yield \\(\\sum_{y\\in H}y=p(p-1)/(2d)\\), giving the mean \\(1/2\\).  Dirichlet\u2019s theorem then produces infinitely many such primes.  ",

            "thinking": "<think>\nI need to find the largest possible n such that for any distinct integers a1 to an, and for any integers m1 to mn with absolute values at most K, not all zero, the sum of mi ai is not divisible by N. N and K are fixed, with N > K.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this is asking. It seems like a problem in combinatorics or number theory, possibly related to the concept of a basis or something in additive combinatorics. The condition is that no non-trivial linear combination with small coefficients is divisible by N.\n\nThis reminds me of the concept of a sidon set or something, but I'm not sure. Perhaps it's related to the subset sum problem or modular arithmetic.\n\nI recall that in coding theory or lattice problems, there might be something similar, but I should stick to basic number theory.\n\nLet me think modulo N. The sum sum mi ai \u2261 0 mod N should never hold for non-zero m with |mi| <= K.\n\nSince the ai are distinct integers, but we're working modulo N, I should consider them as elements in Z/NZ, the integers modulo N.\n\nBut they are distinct integers, so modulo N, they might not be distinct if n > N, but that's fine.\n\nThe condition is that for any non-zero vector m = (m1,...,mn) with each |mi| <= K, the dot product m\u00b7a is not congruent to 0 mod N.\n\nIn other words, the only solution to m\u00b7a \u2261 0 mod N with |mi| <= K is when m is the zero vector, but since not all mi are zero, it's forbidden.\n\nBut m could be non-zero but sum mi ai could be zero mod N, which is what we're preventing.\n\nNow, I need the largest n such that no matter what distinct integers a_i I choose, this condition holds? No, that can't be right because if I choose all a_i the same, then even with m1=1, m2=-1, others 0, sum is zero if a1=a2, but they are distinct, so that's not possible.\n\nThe a_i are distinct integers, so they are different.\n\nBut for fixed n, I need that for some choice of distinct integers a_i, the condition holds, and I want the largest such n.\n\nReading carefully: \"What is the largest possible value of n?\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify that it has to work for some a_i or for all a_i? The problem says: \"Suppose that whenever m1,...,mn are integers... then the sum is not divisible by N.\" This is a condition on the a_i's. So for a fixed set of a_i's, this condition must hold. And I need to find the largest n such that there exist distinct integers a1,...,an satisfying this condition.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I need to maximize n, such that there is a set of n distinct integers where no non-trivial linear combination with coefficients bounded by K in absolute value sums to a multiple of N.\n\nSince the sum is modulo N, and a_i are integers, I can assume without loss of generality that a_i are between 0 and N-1, because modulo N, only their residues matter. Is that correct?\n\nSuppose I have a_i, and I replace each a_i with a_i mod N, so they are in {0,1,2,...,N-1}. Since they are distinct integers, but modulo N, they might not be distinct if n > N. But in this case, if two a_i are congruent mod N, say a1 \u2261 a2 mod N, then with m1=1, m2=-1, others 0, sum is a1 - a2 \u2261 0 mod N, and |m1|=1, |m2|=1, which are <= K as long as K >=1, which it probably is, since K is positive integer.\n\nBut the problem requires that for such m, the sum is not divisible by N, but if a1 \u2261 a2 mod N, then it is divisible. So, to satisfy the condition, all a_i must be distinct modulo N. Because if any two are congruent mod N, then with coefficients 1 and -1, sum is zero mod N.\n\nAnd |1| =1, |-1|=1, so as long as K >=1, which it is since K is positive integer, we must have that all a_i are distinct modulo N.\n\nMoreover, since they are distinct integers, but modulo N, they can be chosen from 0 to N-1, all distinct. So without loss of generality, I can assume that a1 to an are distinct residues modulo N, i.e., they form a subset of Z/NZ.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a subset S of Z/NZ with |S| = n, such that for any non-zero integer vector m = (m_s)_{s in S} with |m_s| <= K for each s, and only finitely many non-zero, but since S is finite, it's fine, such that sum_{s in S} m_s s is not congruent to 0 mod N.\n\nIn other words, no non-trivial linear combination with coefficients in {-K, -K+1, ..., K} sums to 0 mod N.\n\nThe coefficients are integers with absolute value at most K, so from -K to K.\n\nNow, this sum is in Z, but we care about modulo N.\n\nThe set of all possible sums sum m_s s with |m_s| <= K is a set in Z, and we want that 0 is not in this set modulo N, except when all m_s=0.\n\nBut since the sum can be large, we care about modulo N.\n\nThe condition is that the only way sum m_s s \u2261 0 mod N is if m_s=0 for all s.\n\nNow, I need the largest n such that there exists a subset S of Z/NZ with |S|=n satisfying this.\n\nSince Z/NZ is cyclic, I can think of it as integers modulo N.\n\nNow, this reminds me of the concept of a \"basis\" or \"independent set\" in some sense, but with bounded coefficients.\n\nI recall that in additive combinatorics, the size of such sets is related to the concept of the \"sidon constant\" or \"basis of order k\", but here it's different.\n\nAnother thought: the maximal n is related to the minimal size of the sumset or something.\n\nConsider the set of all linear combinations sum m_s s with |m_s| <= K. This is a symmetric interval around 0 in Z, but modulo N, it might wrap around.\n\nThe set of all such sums is contained in the set { sum_{s in S} k_s s | k_s integer, |k_s| <= K }, and this set has size at most (2K+1)^n, but since it's modulo N, the actual size modulo N might be smaller.\n\nThe condition that no non-trivial combination sums to 0 mod N means that the only representation of 0 is the trivial one.\n\nIn group theory, this is similar to S being a basis with bounded coefficients.\n\nI recall that for the cyclic group Z/NZ, the maximal size of a subset with no non-trivial solution to sum m_i a_i =0 with |m_i| small.\n\nThis sounds like the subset sum or the Erd\u0151s\u2013Ginzburg\u2013Ziv theorem, but not quite.\n\nAnother idea: the condition is equivalent to the elements being linearly independent over Q, but that would require n=1, since in Z/NZ, if n>1, they are dependent. But here it's with bounded coefficients, so it's different.\n\nIn fact, for bounded coefficients, it's possible to have larger sets.\n\nFor example, if K=1, then the coefficients are -1,0,1, and the condition is that no non-trivial combination with coefficients in {-1,0,1} sums to 0 mod N. This is equivalent to the subset sum not being zero for non-empty subsets with signs, but actually, since coefficients can be zero, but not all zero, it's like a non-empty signed sum.\n\nSpecifically for K=1, the sum sum m_i a_i with m_i = -1,0,1, not all zero, and sum not 0 mod N.\n\nThis is equivalent to the set having no subset that sums to zero with coefficients \u00b11, but since we can have multiple, it's the same as no non-empty subset summing to zero if we take absolute values, but with signs, it's different.\n\nFor example, if I have a and -a, but since a_i are residues, if I have both a and N-a, then a + (N-a) = N \u22610, but with m1=1, m2=1, sum is 0 mod N. But |m_i|=1<=K if K>=1.\n\nTo avoid that, the set must not contain both x and -x for any x, but -x is N-x mod N, so no element and its \"negative\" modulo N.\n\nBut that's necessary but not sufficient.\n\nFor K=1, the sum sum m_i a_i with m_i in {-1,0,1}, not all zero, and sum not 0 mod N.\n\nThis is equivalent to the set being \"sidon\" or something, but I think for K=1, the maximal n is floor(N/2), by taking a set with no two summing to N, and no element 0, but 0 is problematic because if 0 is in S, then m_s=1 for s=0, others 0, sum is 0, which is bad. So 0 cannot be in S.\n\nAlso, if a and b are such that a+b\u22610, then m_a=1, m_b=1, sum 0, bad.\n\nIf a+b\u2261c, but with three terms, it could be that a+b-c\u22610, so if I have three numbers summing to 0 mod N.\n\nTo prevent any signed sum with coefficients \u00b11 from being 0, I need that the set is \"sum-free\" or \"sidon-like\", but actually for cyclic groups, the maximal size without a solution to x+y=z is about N/2, but here it's x+y-z=0 or x-y=0, etc.\n\nFor coefficients in {-1,0,1}, the equation sum m_i a_i =0 with not all m_i=0.\n\nThis is equivalent to the set having no non-trivial relation with small coefficients.\n\nI recall that for abelian groups, the maximal size is related to the Davenport constant, but that's for sum of subsets without coefficients.\n\nAnother thought: the set of all possible sums sum m_s s with m_s in {-K,-K+1,...,K} is a subset of Z, and its size is at most (2K+1)^n, and it contains 0 only when all m_s=0, by assumption.\n\nModulo N, the number of possible sums is at most min(N, (2K+1)^n), but since 0 is hit only once, by the trivial combination, the size of the sumset must be at least the number of non-trivial combinations plus one, but it's messy.\n\nIn the group Z/NZ, the sumset A + A + ... + A with k terms, but here it's a linear combination with coefficients.\n\nThe set { sum_{s in S} m_s s | m_s integer, |m_s| <= K } can be seen as the image of the map from [-K,K]^S to Z/NZ, defined by (m_s)mapsto sum m_s s mod N.\n\nThis map is a homomorphism from Z^{|S|} to Z/NZ, but with domain restricted to [-K,K]^S, which is a box.\n\nThe kernel of this map consists of vectors m such that sum m_s s \u2261 0 mod N.\n\nThe condition is that the only solution in the box [-K,K]^S with |m_s|<=K is m=0.\n\nThat is, the kernel intersects the box only at 0.\n\nThe size of the box is (2K+1)^n.\n\nThe map is from a subset of Z^n to Z/NZ.\n\nThe number of elements in the image is equal to the size of the domain divided by the size of the kernel in some sense, but since it's not a group homomorphism on the domain, it's tricky.\n\nThe map f: [-K,K]^S \u2229 Z^{|S|} -> Z/NZ, f(m) = sum m_s s mod N.\n\nThe fibers f^{-1}(c) for c in Z/NZ have size at least the size when c=0, but for c=0, by assumption, only m=0 is in the fiber, so |f^{-1}(0)| =1.\n\nFor other c, |f^{-1}(c)| could be larger.\n\nThe sum over c of |f^{-1}(c)| = |domain| = (2K+1)^n.\n\nSince |f^{-1}(0)| =1, the sum over c\u22600 of |f^{-1}(c)| = (2K+1)^n -1.\n\nThe image size is at least the minimum possible, but to ensure that 0 is hit only once, the total number of elements must be at least the size when no collisions, but there could be collisions for other c.\n\nA necessary condition is that (2K+1)^n <= N, because if (2K+1)^n > N, then by pigeonhole principle, two different m vectors map to the same residue mod N, so f(m1) \u2261 f(m2) mod N, so f(m1 - m2) \u2261 0 mod N, and m1 - m2 is not zero, and each component | (m1_s - m2_s) | <= 2K, since each |m_s| <= K, so |diff| <= 2K.\n\nBut the condition requires that for any non-zero m' with |m'_s| <= K, sum m'_s s not 0 mod N. But here, |m'_s| = |m1_s - m2_s| <= 2K, which is larger than K if K>=1.\n\nSo this only gives that if (2K+1)^n > N, then there is m' with |m'_s| <= 2K such that sum m'_s s \u22610 mod N, but we need for |m'_s| <= K, so it's weaker.\n\nTo get a contradiction for |m_s| <= K, I need that the map is injective when restricted to [-K,K]^S.\n\nThat is, if (2K+1)^n > N, then since the domain has size (2K+1)^n > N, and the codomain has size N, by pigeonhole, there are two different m1, m2 in [-K,K]^S such that f(m1) \u2261 f(m2) mod N, so f(m1 - m2) \u22610 mod N, and m1 - m2 \u22600, and each component | (m1_s - m2_s) | <= 2K.\n\nBut for the condition to hold, we need that for all non-zero m' with |m'_s| <= K, f(m') not \u22610, but here |m'_s| <=2K, which may be larger than K, so if 2K > K, which is always for K>0, this doesn't directly contradict.\n\nFor example, if K is large, 2K could be much larger than K, so this doesn't help.\n\nTo force a solution with coefficients bounded by K, I need a better argument.\n\nI recall that in coding theory or lattice problems, there is the concept of the minimum distance, but here it's different.\n\nAnother idea: the maximal n is achieved when S is an arithmetic progression or something.\n\nSuppose S is the set {1,2,3,...,n}. Then what is the smallest non-trivial sum with |m_i| <=K.\n\nFor example, if I take m_i small, but sum m_i i could be small.\n\nTo be 0 mod N, it needs to be at least N in absolute value or something, but modulo N.\n\nThe smallest non-zero linear combination might be small.\n\nFor instance, if I have consecutive integers, then the differences are small, so I can get small sums.\n\nFor example, with coefficients 1 and -1, a_{i+1} - a_i is small, but if a_i are consecutive, a_{i+1} - a_i =1, which is not 0 mod N unless N|1, which is not.\n\nBut with more terms, I can get larger sums.\n\nTo get sum m_i a_i \u22610 mod N, with |m_i|<=K.\n\nThe set S generates a subgroup, and the index or something.\n\nI recall that for the group Z/NZ, the minimal size of a generating set, but here it's with bounded coefficients.\n\nThe key point is that the set must be \"K-free\" or \"basis of order 2K\" or something.\n\nI remember that in the theory of the subset sum, there is a theorem by Olson or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the condition implies that the elements are linearly independent over the rationals, but that's impossible for n>1 in Z/NZ. No, linear independence over Q is stronger and not necessary.\n\nFor example, in Z/NZ, if I take S = {1}, then it works for n=1.\n\nIf I take S={1,2}, and N large, with K=1, is there m1,m2 not both zero, |m_i|<=1, sum m1*1 + m2*2 =0 mod N.\n\nPossible if m1=2, m2=-1, but |m1|=2>1 if K=1, so not allowed. Or m1=0,m2=1, sum=2\u22600, etc. The only possibilities are (1,0): sum1, (0,1):sum2, (1,1):sum3, (-1,0):-1, (0,-1):-2, (1,-1):1-2=-1, (-1,1):-1+2=1, (-1,-1):-3. None are 0 mod N if N>3, say. So for N large, n=2 is possible.\n\nBut if N is small, say N=3, K=1, then for S={1,2}, sum with m1=1,m2=1:1+2=3\u22610 mod 3, and |m_i|=1<=1, so not allowed. So for N=3,K=1, what is possible? If I take a single element, say {1}, then only non-trivial m is m1=1 or -1, sum \u00b11 \u22600 mod 3, since N>K, K=1,N=3>1, so 1 not divisible by 3. Similarly for {2}. If I take {0}, but 0 is bad, as m1=1, sum0. Or {1,2} as above, bad. So maximal n is 1.\n\nBut floor(N/2) or something? For N=3, floor(3/2)=1, yes.\n\nEarlier with N large, n=2 for |S|=2.\n\nCan I take n=3? Say S={1,2,3}. With K=1, is there a combination? m1=1,m2=1,m3=-1:1+2-3=0, which is 0 mod any N. Oh! So sum is 0, so it's always 0, so for any N, if I have 1,2,3, then with coefficients 1,1,-1, sum is 0. So for K>=1, if I have three consecutive integers, I can get sum 0.\n\nBut are they distinct mod N? If N>3, yes. So for n=3, it's impossible to avoid such a combination? But perhaps I can choose different set.\n\nFor example, take S={1,3,5} for some N. Then with K=1, possible sums: various combinations. For instance, 1+3-4, but 4 not in S. Or 5-3-2, not. Suppose N large. Is there m1,m2,m3 in {-1,0,1} not all zero, sum m_i a_i =0. So possible equations: a_i = a_j for some i\u2260j, but distinct, no. a_i + a_j = a_k, or a_i = a_j + a_k, or a_i + a_j + a_k=0, etc.\n\nFor S={1,3,5}, 1+1=2, not in S, but with coefficients, if I take two 1's, but each element can be used only once in the linear combination? No, the linear combination is sum m_s s, so for each s, m_s is the coefficient, so for a fixed s, m_s can be non-zero, but it's a linear combination, not a subset sum.\n\nIn this case, for a particular s, m_s is the coefficient for that element, so if an element is repeated, but in this set, elements are distinct, so each s appears at most once, but m_s can be different values.\n\nFor S={1,3,5}, the sum is m1*1 + m2*3 + m3*5, with |m_i|<=1.\n\nPossible sums: 0,\u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b15, \u00b11\u00b13=\u00b14,\u00b12, \u00b11\u00b15=\u00b16,\u00b14, \u00b13\u00b15=\u00b18,\u00b12, and \u00b11\u00b13\u00b15=\u00b19,\u00b17,\u00b13,\u00b11.\n\nSet to 0: is there non-trivial combination? m1=m2=m3=0 is trivial. Otherwise, for example, if m1=1,m2=0,m3=-1:1-5=-4\u22600. m1=1,m2=-1,m3=0:1-3=-2\u22600. m1=0,m2=1,m3=-1:3-5=-2\u22600. m1=1,m2=1,m3=-1:1+3-5=-1\u22600. m1=1,m2=-1,m3=1:1-3+5=3\u22600. etc. Also with two non-zero: like 1 and 3, sum \u00b11\u00b13=\u00b12 or \u00b14, not 0. Similarly others. So if N does not divide any of these sums, i.e., if N>9 or so, then it might work. For example, the sums are integers between -9 and 9, so if N>18, say, and not dividing any non-zero sum, which is likely, but specifically, the sums are odd integers since all elements odd, so if N even, might be divisible, but for example N=10, is -2 divisible by 10? No, -4 no, etc. The sums include -4,-2,0,2,4, but 0 only when all m_i=0? Is there a combination summing to 0? For example, m1=3,m2=-1, but |m1|=3>1 if K=1, not allowed. With |m_i|<=1, the sums are as above, and 0 is not achieved except trivially. For example, is 1+5-6, but 6 not in set. The smallest non-zero sums are \u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13,etc, and none are 0. In fact, for this set, the only way to get 0 is if m1=m2=m3=0, because the numbers are linearly independent over Q, but 1,3,5 are linearly dependent since 5-3-2*1=0, but that requires m1=2, |m1|=2>1. With |m_i|<=1, no dependency. So for large N, n=3 is possible with K=1.\n\nBut earlier with consecutive integers, it was bad. So choice matters.\n\nNow, what is the maximal n? For K=1, can I take n=4? Say S={1,3,5,7}. Then m1=1,m2=1,m3=1,m4=-1:1+3+5-7=2\u22600. Or other combinations. But is there one summing to 0? For example, 1+7=8, 3+5=8, so 1+7 - (3+5) =0, but that would require coefficients m1=1,m4=1 for 1 and 7, m2=-1,m3=-1 for 3 and 5, so sum m_i a_i =1*1 + (-1)*3 + (-1)*5 +1*7 =1-3-5+7=0. And |m_i|=1<=K=1. Oh! So sum is 0. So for any N, this sum is 0, so divisible by N. So with n=4, K=1, I cannot avoid such a combination if I take odd numbers or something.\n\nBut perhaps I can choose a different set. Suppose I take a set with large gaps. For example, geometric progression. Say S={1,2,4,8,...,2^{k}} modulo N.\n\nBut modulo N, it might wrap around.\n\nSuppose N large, say N > 2^{k+1} or something. Then with coefficients in {-1,0,1}, can I get sum 0? For example, if I have 1,2,4, then 4-2-2*1, but again |m|>1. With |m_i|<=1, possible sums are all numbers with absolute value at most 1+2+4=7, and in binary representation, each number can be represented in at least one way, but for sum to 0, only trivial. For three elements, 1,2,4, sums from -7 to 7, 0 only if all m_i=0. For four elements, 1,2,4,8, sum m_i 2^{i-1} with |m_i|<=1, the sum ranges from -15 to 15, and every integer in between can be represented? No, with coefficients -1,0,1, it's like ternary, but for binary digits, with coefficients 0,\u00b11, it can represent all integers in [- (2^k -1), 2^k -1], but for k=3, -15 to 15, but can it represent all? For example, 3 = 4-1, so m8? Elements 1,2,4,8. Sum to 3: 2+1 or 4-1, so yes. But 0 is only when all zero. Is there non-trivial representation of 0? For example, 8-4-4, but only one 4. 1+2+4-7, not. The minimal non-zero sum is 1, and since all sums are integers, 0 only trivial. But is that true? Suppose I have m1 for 1, m2 for 2, etc. Set m1*1 + m2*2 + m3*4 + m4*8 =0. With |m_i|<=1. Suppose m4=0, then sum of first three at most 7 in abs, not 0. m4=1, then m1+2m2+4m3 = -8. Left side between -7 and 7, -8 not in range. m4=-1, then m1+2m2+4m3=8, again not in [-7,7]. So indeed, only trivial solution. So for n=4, K=1, with S={1,2,4,8}, and N>15, say, then it works.\n\nBut if N is small, say N=16, then sum with m4=1, others 0: 8\u22600, but also, 16\u22610, but 16 is not in the sum range, max sum is 15<16, so no sum is multiple of 16 except possibly 0, which is only trivial. So still works for N=16? Sums are from -15 to 15, 0 only trivial, and 16>15, so no multiple of 16 in the sum set except 0, so yes, no sum \u22610 mod 16 except trivial.\n\nBut if N=15, then 15 is in the sum, for example all m_i=1:1+2+4+8=15\u22610 mod 15, and |m_i|=1, so bad. So for N=15, this set doesn't work.\n\nBut I could choose a different set. For example, take S={1,2,3,6}, but 1+2+3-6=0, same problem.\n\nOr take larger numbers. Suppose I take S={1,3,9,27} if N large. Then similar to before.\n\nWith n=4, K=1, is there always a non-trivial sum to 0 mod N? Not necessarily, as above if N large and set chosen properly.\n\nBut for fixed N, I need to maximize n.\n\nIn the geometric progression, n can be up to the largest k such that 2^k < N, because if 2^k >= N, then the sum might be large, but for example if 2^k = N, then with all m_i=1, sum 1+2+...+2^{k-1} = 2^k -1 = N-1 \u2261 -1 \u22600 mod N. If I take m_i such that sum is N, but with |m_i|<=1, sum is at most 2^k -1 < 2^k =N if k>=1, so sum <N, so cannot be multiple of N except 0. Sum is at least - (2^k -1) > -N, so only possible multiple is 0. And as before, only trivial representation for 0. So for S={1,2,4,...,2^{k-1}} with 2^k <= N, then |S|=k, and it works as long as the sums don't hit multiple of N, but since max |sum| = 2^k -1 < N if 2^k <= N, and min |non-zero sum| >=1, so no non-zero sum is divisible by N, since |sum| < N for non-zero sum? Max |sum| is 2^k -1, which is less than N if 2^k <= N, and since N > K=1, and sum is integer, if |sum| < N and sum \u22600, then sum not divisible by N. And sum=0 only for trivial m. So yes, for n such that 2^n <= N, I can take the geometric progression with ratio 2, and it works for K=1.\n\nBut 2^n <= N, so n <= log2 N.\n\nBut earlier for n=4, with arithmetic progression it didn't work, but with geometric it does.\n\nBut is this maximal? For example, can I take n larger than log2 N?\n\nSuppose I try n = floor(log2 N) +1. Then 2^n > N. With geometric progression S={1,2,4,...,2^{n-1}}, then the sum with all m_i=1 is 1+2+...+2^{n-1} = 2^n -1. If 2^n -1 is divisible by N, then it might be 0 mod N. But even if not, the sum could be congruent to 0 mod N for some other combination.\n\nFor example, N=10, log2 10 \u22483.32, so floor 3, 2^3=8<10, so I can take n=3, S={1,2,4}, sums from -7 to 7, no multiple of 10, good.\n\nCan I take n=4? 2^4=16>10. If I take S={1,2,4,8}, max sum 15>10, min non-zero |sum|>=1. Possible sums: for example, 8+2=10\u22610 mod 10, with m8=1,m2=1,m1=0,m4=0, sum=10\u22610. Oh, so yes, 8+2=10\u22610. So bad.\n\nCan I choose another set? Say S={1,3,9,27}, but 27>10, modulo 10: residues 1,3,9,7. Sums: 1+9=10\u22610, same thing.\n\nS={3,4,5,6}, then 3+4+5-6=6\u22600, but 4+6=10\u22610 if N=10. Or 5+5, but only one 5.\n\nS={1,2,3,4}: 1+2+3+4=10\u22610. Or 2+3+5, but same.\n\nS={0,1,2,3}, but 0 is bad.\n\nS={1,5,7,9} mod 10: 1,5,7,9. Sums: 1+9=10\u22610, bad. 5+5, not. 1+5+7-13, not. But 1+9=10\u22610.\n\nIs there a set of 4 distinct residues mod 10 with no non-trivial signed sum to 0 with coeff \u00b11? That is, no subset sums to 0 with signs.\n\nBut since 1+9=10\u22610, and 9-(-1) but residues are positive, but 1 and 9 are both in, so m1=1,m9=1, sum=10\u22610.\n\nSimilarly, if I avoid such pairs. Suppose I take all odd numbers: 1,3,5,7. Then 1+3+5-9, not. But 1+9\u22610, but 9 not in set. 3+7=10\u22610, oh, 3+7=10\u22610. Similarly, 1+3+5+7=16\u22616\u22600, but 3+7=10\u22610.\n\nTake {1,2,4,7}. Sums: 1+2+4+7=14\u22614, 7+4-1=10\u22610? m7=1,m4=1,m1=-1, sum=7+4-1=10\u22610, and |m_i|=1, so bad.\n\n{1,2,5,6}: 1+5=6, so 1+5 -6=0, bad.\n\n{1,3,4,8}: 1+3+4-8=0? 1+3+4=8, so 8-8=0, but same element? m for 8: if I set m8=-1, and m1=1,m3=1,m4=1, sum=1+3+4-8=0. Bad.\n\n{1,4,5,6}: 4+6=10\u22610, bad.\n\n{2,3,4,5}: 2+3+5=10\u22610? 2+3+5=10, yes, so m2=1,m3=1,m5=1, sum=10\u22610. Or 5+5, not.\n\n{1,3,5,7} as before, 3+7=10.\n\nSeems hard to avoid. Suppose I take {1,2,3,7}. Then sums: 1+2+3+7=13\u22613, 1+2=3, so if I have m1=1,m2=1,m3=-1? But then sum for a3 is -1 times a3, so sum m1 a1 + m2 a2 + m3 a3 + m7 a7 =1*1 +1*2 + (-1)*3 +0*7=1+2-3=0. Oh, again 0. So with coefficients, I can have cancellation.\n\nTo avoid this, the set must be such that no subset sums to another element with signs, but it's tricky.\n\nFor N=10, K=1, maximal n might be 3. For example, take S={1,2,3}. Sums: max |sum| =1+2+3=6<10, and sums include \u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13,\u00b1(1+2)=\u00b13, but 1+2=3, which is in the set, but for sum to 0: is there non-trivial? m1=1,m2=1,m3=-1:1+2-3=0, exactly 0. So for any N, 1+2-3=0, so always divisible. So I cannot take three consecutive integers.\n\nBut earlier with geometric, for n=3, S={1,2,4}, sums max 7<10, and no zero sum non-trivially. For example, possible sums: 0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b14,\u00b11\u00b12=\u00b13,\u00b11\u00b14=\u00b15,\u00b13,\u00b12\u00b14=\u00b16,\u00b12, and \u00b11\u00b12\u00b14=\u00b17,\u00b15,\u00b13,\u00b11. None are 0 except when all m_i=0. And since |sum|<=7<10, not divisible by 10. So for N=10, K=1, n=3 is possible with S={1,2,4}.\n\nCan n=4? From above attempts, seems difficult. Suppose I try S={1,3,4,5}. Then 1+4=5, so 1+4-5=0, bad.\n\nS={1,2,5,7}: 2+5=7, so 2+5-7=0, bad.\n\nS={1,3,4,6}: 1+3=4, so 1+3-4=0, bad.\n\nS={1,3,5,8}: 3+5=8, so 3+5-8=0, bad.\n\nS={2,3,4,7}: 3+4=7, so 3+4-7=0, bad.\n\nS={1,4,6,9}: but mod 10, 1,4,6,9. 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={3,5,7,9}: all odd, 3+7=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={1,5,6,8}: 1+5+6-12, not. 5+5, not. 1+8=9, 5+6=11\u22611, not 0. 1+5=6, so 1+5-6=0, bad.\n\nSeems always there is a dependency. Perhaps for n=4, it's impossible when N=10.\n\nAssume there is a set S={a,b,c,d} distinct mod 10. Then consider all pairs. If a+b \u22610, but then m_a=1,m_b=1, sum0. But a+b\u22610 mod 10, so a and b are negatives, but since distinct, possible if a=5,b=5, but not distinct. Or a=1,b=9, etc. So if any two sum to 0, bad, but sum to 0 only if both 0 or 5 and 5, but 0 not allowed, and distinct, so only if N even and a=N/2, but for N=10, a=5, but only one 5. So no two sum to 0.\n\nBut could sum to 10, which is 0 mod 10. So if a+b\u226110\u22610, same as above. So to avoid, no two sum to 0 or 10, but since mod 10, sum to 0 mod 10.\n\nAlso, no element is 0.\n\nMoreover, no three sum to 0, or two sum to a third, etc.\n\nFor example, if a+b\u2261c mod 10, then m_a=1,m_b=1,m_c=-1, sum=0.\n\nSimilarly, if a\u2261b+c, same.\n\nOr if a+b+c\u22610, then with all +1, sum=0.\n\nSo we need to avoid:\n\n1. a+b \u22610 for some a,b (but since distinct and not 0, only if a+b=N, but mod N, a+b\u22610)\n\n2. a+b\u2261c for some a,b,c distinct or not, but if c in S, and a,b in S.\n\n3. a+b+c\u22610\n\n4. also, a\u2261b for some, but distinct, so no.\n\nWith coefficients \u00b11, the possible equations are sum of some subset equal to sum of another subset, with signs.\n\nThe condition that no non-trivial signed sum with coefficients \u00b11 is zero is equivalent to the set being \"linearly independent over the integers with coefficients \u00b11\", but it's a standard result that for Z/NZ, the maximal size is floor(N/2) or something, but for N=10, floor(10/2)=5, but we have n=4<5, and it seems hard.\n\nFor example, can I take 5 elements? Probably not, but for n=4, perhaps possible with careful choice.\n\nSuppose I take S={1,2,3,6} mod 10. Then 1+2+3=6, so 1+2+3-6=0, bad.\n\nS={1,2,4,8} as before, 8+2=10\u22610.\n\nS={1,3,7,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={2,4,5,9}: 2+4+5-11, not. 2+8, not. 4+6, not. 5+5, not. 2+4=6, not in S. 2+5=7, not. 4+5=9, so 4+5-9=0, bad.\n\nS={3,4,5,8}: 3+5=8, so 3+5-8=0, bad.\n\nS={1,4,5,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={1,5,7,8}: 1+7=8, so 1+7-8=0, bad.\n\nS={3,5,6,7}: 3+7=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={4,5,6,7}: 4+6=10\u22610, bad.\n\nAlways seems to have a pair or triple that sums to 0 or to another element.\n\nSuppose I take S={0,1,2,3}, but 0 is bad, m0=1, sum0.\n\nOr S={5,1,2,3}, but 5 is in, then m5=1, sum5\u22600, but also 1+2+3+5=11\u22611, not 0. But 1+2+3=6, not 0. Is there a combination? m1=1,m2=1,m3=1,m5=-1:1+2+3-5=1\u22600. m1=5,m2=0,etc, |m1|>1 not allowed. But 5+5=10\u22610, but only one 5. So with |m_i|<=1, no sum to 0. For example, possible sums: min -5-1-2-3= -11, max 11. Is 0 in the sum set? For example, 5-3-2=0, so m5=1,m3=-1,m2=-1,m1=0, sum=5-3-2=0. Oh! Yes, so 5-2-3=0. So bad. So cannot.\n\nAnother try: S={1,6,7,8}. Then 1+7=8, so 1+7-8=0, bad.\n\nS={2,3,7,8}: 2+8=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={1,2,7,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={3,4,6,7}: 3+7=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={1,3,8,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={4,6,7,9}: 4+6=10\u22610, bad.\n\nAlways a pair sums to 0 or 10.\n\nFor N=10, since it's even, and small, perhaps it's impossible to have n=4 with K=1.\n\nAssume S has 4 elements. The sum of all elements with m_i=1 is s. If s\u22610 mod 10, then bad. Otherwise, not. But there are other combinations.\n\nThe number of possible non-trivial m vectors is 3^4 -1 =81-1=80, since each m_i in {-1,0,1}, not all 0. Each sum is in 0 to 9, but can be negative, but modulo 10, so values in 0,1,2,...,9. By pigeonhole, since 80 > 10, some sum is hit by multiple m, but that doesn't directly help.\n\nIf two different m give the same sum mod 10, then their difference gives a combination summing to 0 with coefficients in {-2,-1,0,1,2}, but not bounded by K=1.\n\nTo get a combination with |m_i|<=1, I need that the map is injective, but 3^4=81>10, so by pigeonhole, not injective, so there are m1 \u2260 m2 with f(m1) \u2261 f(m2) mod 10, so f(m1-m2) \u22610 mod 10, and m1-m2 has components | (m1_i - m2_i) | <=2, since |m_i|<=1, so |diff| <=2.\n\nSo there is a non-zero m' with |m'_i| <=2 such that sum m'_i a_i \u22610 mod 10.\n\nBut for K=1, we need to prevent for |m_i|<=1, so this doesn't contradict, since |m'_i|<=2 >1.\n\nFor example, in the geometric set, we had a combination with |m_i|=1 summing to 10, which is 0 mod 10.\n\nBut if I could ensure that no combination with |m_i|<=2 sums to 0, but for K=1, I only care about |m_i|<=1.\n\nSo for N=10, K=1, is there a set with n=4?\n\nLet me try S={1,2,3,4}. Then 1+2+3+4=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={0,1,2,3}: bad because of 0.\n\nS={5,6,7,8}: 5+5, not. 6+4, not. 5+5=10, but only one 5. 8+2, not. 7+3, not. 6+8=14\u22614, 5+7=12\u22612, not 0. 5+6+7+8=26\u22616\u22600. Is there a combination? m5=1,m6=1,m7=1,m8=1: sum26\u22616. m5=1,m6=1,m7=-1,m8=0:5+6-7=4\u22600. m5=1,m6=-1,m7=0,m8=0:5-6= -1\u22619. etc. Can I get 0? Suppose m5 a5 + m6 a6 + m7 a7 + m8 a8 =5m5+6m6+7m7+8m8 \u22610 mod 10.\n\nWith |m_i|<=1, not all 0.\n\nSuppose m8=0, then 5m5+6m6+7m7. Possible values: if m7=0, then 5m5+6m6, which is 0,\u00b15,\u00b16,\u00b111,\u00b11, not 0. If m7=1, then 5m5+6m6+7, which is 7,12,13,2,3,8, etc, not 0. If m7=-1, 5m5+6m6-7, which is -7,-2,-1,-12,-13, etc, not 0.\n\nSimilarly if m8=1, then 5m5+6m6+7m7+8. Values like 8,13,14,15,3,4,5, etc. 5+6+7+8=26\u22616, 5+6+7-8=10\u22610? m5=1,m6=1,m7=1,m8=-1: sum5+6+7-8=10\u22610. Oh! Yes, 5+6+7-8=10\u22610. So bad.\n\nS={1,3,7,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={2,4,6,8}: 2+8=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={1,4,7,8}: 1+7=8, so 1+7-8=0, bad.\n\nS={3,5,7,9}: 3+7=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={1,5,8,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={2,3,8,9}: 2+8=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={4,5,8,9}: 4+6, not. 5+5, not. 4+5=9, so 4+5-9=0, bad.\n\nS={1,6,8,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={3,6,7,8}: 3+7=10\u22610, bad.\n\nS={1,2,8,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad.\n\nAlways seems to have either a pair summing to 0 or 10, or a triple like 1+7-8 or 5+6+7-8.\n\nFor N=10, K=1, it might be impossible to have n=4. And for n=3, it is possible, as with {1,2,4}.\n\nSo maximal n=3 for N=10,K=1.\n\nAnd 2^3=8<10, 2^4=16>10, and log2 10\u22483.32, floor 3.\n\nBut earlier for general K, in the geometric progression with ratio r, but for K>1, it might be different.\n\nBack to the general case.\n\nFrom the geometric progression with ratio 2, for K=1, n <= log2 N.\n\nBut for larger K, I can take larger n.\n\nFor example, if K=2, then coefficients can be -2,-1,0,1,2.\n\nWith geometric progression S={1,2,4,...,2^{k-1}}, then sum with m_i=1 is 2^k -1.\n\nIf I take m_i such that sum is 0, but with |m_i|<=2, for example, if I have 1 and 2, then 2*1 -1*2 =0, but |m_i|<=2, m1=2, m2= -1, |m1|=2<=K if K>=2, |m2|=1<=2, so sum 2*1 + (-1)*2 =0, so for any set containing 1 and 2, if K>=2, then this sum is 0. So for n>=2, if I have 1 and 2, it's bad for K>=2.\n\nBut I can choose a different set. For example, take larger numbers. Suppose I take S={3,6,12,24,...} but modulo N, and if I take m_i small, sum might not be 0.\n\nFor example, with K=2, I can take a geometric progression with larger ratio. Say ratio r >2K+1 or something.\n\nThe minimal non-zero |sum| should be large, but modulo N.\n\nTo avoid small sums, the elements should be large and spaced out.\n\nIn the linear combination, the sum sum m_i a_i with |m_i|<=K, not all zero, should not be divisible by N.\n\nThe smallest possible non-zero sum in absolute value is at least the gcd or something, but it's complicated.\n\nI recall that in coding theory, this is related to the concept of the \"minimum distance\" or \"error-correcting codes\", but in the integer lattice.\n\nAnother idea: the set S should be such that the differences are large, so that no small linear combination is zero.\n\nThe maximal n is achieved when S is an arithmetic progression with large common difference.\n\nSuppose S is an AP with common difference d. Then the sum sum m_i a_i = d * sum m_i i + sum m_i a1, but it's messy.\n\nThe values a_i are in arithmetic progression, say a_i = i*d for i=1 to n, but modulo N.\n\nThen sum m_i i d = d * sum m_i i.\n\nThis is 0 mod N if d * sum m_i i \u22610 mod N.\n\nSince d and N may have gcd, say g = gcd(d,N), then this implies (d/g) * sum m_i i \u22610 mod (N/g).\n\nSince d/g and N/g are coprime, this is equivalent to sum m_i i \u22610 mod N/g.\n\nNow, sum m_i i is an integer with |sum m_i i| <= K * sum |i| <= K n(n+1)/2.\n\nFor this to be 0 only when m=0, we need that for all non-zero m with |m_i|<=K, sum m_i i not \u22610 mod N/g.\n\nBut sum m_i i is the dot product, and i are integers from 1 to n.\n\nThis is similar to the original problem but for the index i.\n\nTo have no non-trivial sum sum m_i i \u22610 mod M, with M=N/g, and |m_i|<=K.\n\nBut M may be large.\n\nThe size n is limited by the size of the interval for sum m_i i.\n\n|sum m_i i| <= K * sum_{i=1}^n i = K n(n+1)/2.\n\nIf this is less than M = N/g, then since it's integer, if it's not zero, it can't be 0 mod M, so we need that sum m_i i =0 only when m=0, but sum m_i i =0 for m not zero is possible, like if n>=2, m1=1, m2= -1, sum i1 - i2, which is not zero if i1\u2260i2.\n\nSo we need that the only way sum m_i i =0 is m=0, which requires that the i are linearly independent over Q, which for integers from 1 to n, is not true for n>1.\n\nSo with AP, it's hard to get large n.\n\nFor geometric progression, as before.\n\nFor general K, with geometric progression with ratio r, S = { r^0, r^1, r^2, ..., r^{n-1} } modulo N.\n\nThen the sum sum m_i r^{i-1} with |m_i| <= K.\n\nThis is a number in base r with digits from -K to K.\n\nThe minimal non-zero |sum| is at least 1, and maximal |sum| is at most K (r^n -1)/(r-1).\n\nIf this max is less than N, then since |sum| < N for non-zero sum, and sum integer, not divisible by N, and sum=0 only if all m_i=0, because the representation is unique if the digits are in a range that allows unique representation.\n\nFor the sum to be 0 only for m=0, we need that the representation is unique, which requires that the digit range is small enough.\n\nIn base r, with digits from -K to K, the number of possible sums is (2K+1)^n, and they are all distinct as long as the digit range is less than r, i.e., 2K+1 <= r, because then there is no carry-over, and the representation is unique.\n\nIs that correct? In integer representation, if the digit set has size less than or equal to the base, and is a complete residue system, then representation is unique, but here digits are symmetric.\n\nFor example, in base r, if digits are from 0 to r-1, unique representation. If from -a to b, it may not be unique.\n\nTo have unique representation, we need that the digit set has size less than r, and is an interval or something.\n\nA standard result is that if the digit set D satisfies |D| < r, then every integer has at most one representation in base r with digits in D.\n\nBut here, we want that different digit vectors give different sums, which is equivalent to the map being injective.\n\nThe sum sum d_i r^i =0 only if all d_i=0.\n\nThis happens if the digit set is contained in (-r/2, r/2] or something, but for uniqueness, if |D| < r, then yes, the map is injective.\n\nRecall: for the base r representation, if the digit set D has size |D| < r, then the map from Z^n to Z given by (d0,d1,...,d_{n-1})mapsto sum d_i r^i is injective for the given n, because if two different digit vectors give the same sum, then their difference gives a polynomial in r that is zero, but since r is integer, and digits bounded, if |D| < r, it can be shown that no non-trivial combination sums to zero.\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition is that the digit set does not contain two elements congruent mod r, but since |D| < r, by pigeonhole, it might have, but for uniqueness in fixed length, it's different.\n\nFor fixed n, the map from D^n to Z, sum d_i r^i.\n\nThis is injective if for any two different vectors d and d', |sum (d_i - d'_i) r^i| >=1, but it's sufficient that the minimal difference is at least 1.\n\nThe minimal non-zero |sum (d_i - d'_i) r^i| for d\u2260d' is at least min over i |d_i - d'_i| times min r^i, but it's messy.\n\nIf the digit range is small, specifically, if the digit set D satisfies that |d - d'| < r for all d,d' in D, but that's always true if |D| small.\n\nA standard result is that if the digit set D is contained in an interval of length less than r, then the representation is unique for each number, but for fixed n, it's about the map being injective.\n\nSuppose that for some non-zero vector m, sum m_i r^i =0.\n\nWith m_i = d_i - d'_i for some d,d', but in our case, for the sum sum d_i r^i =0 with d_i in D.\n\nIn our problem, we have sum m_i s_i = sum m_i r^{i-1} =0.\n\nSo for the geometric progression, sum m_i r^{i-1} =0.\n\nThis is a polynomial in r, and for it to be zero, if r is integer, and m_i not all zero, it may happen.\n\nTo prevent this, we need that r is large enough so that no non-trivial combination with |m_i| <= K sums to zero.\n\nThe smallest non-zero |sum m_i r^{i-1}| for integer m_i not all zero is at least 1, but it could be small.\n\nFor example, if r=1, then sum m_i *1, which can be small.\n\nTo have large minimal norm, r should be large.\n\nIn particular, if r > 2K, then for any non-zero m, |sum m_i r^{i-1}| >= r^{0} - K r^{1} / (r-1) or something, but let's estimate.\n\nThe sum S = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} m_i r^i , |m_i| <= K, not all zero.\n\nSuppose the highest i with m_i \u22600 is j. Then |S| >= |m_j| r^j - sum_{i=0}^{j-1} |m_i| r^i >= r^j - K sum_{i=0}^{j-1} r^i = r^j - K \\frac{r^j -1}{r-1}.\n\nSince r^j >=1, |S| >= r^j (1 - \\frac{K}{r-1}) - \\frac{K}{r-1}.\n\nIf r-1 > K, then 1 - K/(r-1) >0, so |S| >= r^j (1 - K/(r-1)) - K/(r-1) >0, and in fact |S| >= r^j (1 - K/(r-1)) - K/(r-1) >= 1 - K/(r-1) - K/(r-1) = 1 - 2K/(r-1), but this could be negative if r small.\n\nBetter: since r^j >= r^{j-1} (r) >= ... but for lower bound.\n\n|S| >= |m_j| r^j - K \\frac{r^j -1}{r-1} = r^j ( |m_j| - \\frac{K}{r-1} ) + \\frac{K}{r-1}.\n\nSince |m_j| >=1, if |m_j| > K/(r-1), which is true if r-1 > K, since |m_j| >=1 > K/(r-1) if r-1 > K.\n\nBut if r-1 <= K, may not hold.\n\nAssume r > K+1, so r-1 > K. Then |m_j| - K/(r-1) >= 1 - K/(r-1) >0, so |S| >= r^j (1 - K/(r-1)) + \\frac{K}{r-1} >0.\n\nMoreover, |S| >= 1 - K/(r-1) >0 since r-1>K.\n\nBut this is greater than 0, but we need it not to be divisible by N, and also for modulo N.\n\nTo ensure that it is not divisible by N, we need that |S| < N for all such S, or that it doesn't hit multiple of N.\n\nBut |S| can be large if j large.\n\nFor example, if n large, r^j can be large.\n\nThe maximal |S| is K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1}.\n\nIf this is less than N, then |S| < N for all such sums, and since S\u22600 for non-zero m, |S| >=1, so not divisible by N.\n\nMoreover, S=0 only when m=0, as per the lower bound.\n\nBut is S=0 only when m=0? Under what conditions?\n\nFrom above, if r > K+1, then for any non-zero m, |S| >= 1 - K/(r-1) >0, so yes, S\u22600.\n\nMoreover, if K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1} < N, then |S| < N, so not divisible by N.\n\nSo for such r and n, the set works.\n\nNow, r should be an integer, and we need r > K+1, and K (r^n -1)/(r-1) < N.\n\nr should be chosen to maximize n.\n\nr > K+1, so minimal r is K+2.\n\nThen n such that K \\frac{(K+2)^n -1}{(K+2)-1} = K \\frac{(K+2)^n -1}{K+1} < N.\n\nAsymptotically, (K+2)^n < N \\frac{K+1}{K} \u2248 N, so n < log_{K+2} N.\n\nBut we can choose r larger to get larger n, but if r larger, (r^n) grows faster, so for fixed n, larger r gives larger max sum, so to satisfy the inequality, smaller n. To maximize n, we should choose r as small as possible, but r > K+1, so r = K+2.\n\nThen n satisfies K \\frac{(K+2)^n -1}{K+1} < N.\n\nSince (K+2)^n -1 < (K+2)^n, and K/(K+1) <1, so approximately (K+2)^n < N \\frac{K+1}{K}, so n < log_{K+2} (N \\frac{K+1}{K}).\n\nBut for large N, this is fine.\n\nMoreover, we need that the residues are distinct modulo N, which is satisfied if all r^i are distinct mod N, which requires that r^i not equivalent mod N for i<j, i.e., that the order of r mod N is large, but since we need distinctness only for the set, not for the powers, we just need that no two powers are congruent mod N, which is equivalent to r not being a root of unity mod N, but to ensure distinctness, we need that N does not divide r^i - r^j for i>j, i.e., N does not divide r^j (r^{i-j} -1). Since r and N may not be coprime, it's tricky, but in our case, since we have the sum condition, and if the powers are not distinct, say r^i \u2261 r^j mod N for i>j, then with m_i=1, m_j=-1, others 0, sum r^i - r^j \u22610 mod N, and |m_i|=1<=K as long as K>=1, which is true, so this would violate the condition unless K<1, but K>=1. So indeed, to satisfy the condition, we must have all r^i distinct modulo N, so the powers must be distinct mod N.\n\nThus, r must be such that the multiplicative order is at least n, or more precisely, that r^i \u2260 r^j mod N for 0<=i<j<n.\n\nThis requires that N does not divide r^j (r^{i-j} -1) for any i>j, but since r^j may share factors with N, it's complicated, but for simplicity, if we choose r coprime to N, then the order must be at least n.\n\nTo maximize n, we need r coprime to N with large order.\n\nBut in the inequality, we have r>K+1, and K (r^n -1)/(r-1) < N.\n\nWith r=K+2, but r=K+2 may not be coprime to N.\n\nTo ensure coprimality, we might need to choose r larger or appropriately.\n\nBut for the existence, as long as there exists an integer r > K+1 coprime to N, but if N is large, yes, by Dirichlet or just choose r large prime not dividing N.\n\nBut to maximize n, we can still use r=K+2 if coprime, else choose a larger r.\n\nBut the bound is roughly n < log_{r} (N (r-1)/K ) \u2248 log_r N.\n\nWith minimal r=K+2, so n \u2248 log_{K+2} N.\n\nBut is this achievable? Only if the powers are distinct mod N, which requires that the order of r mod N is at least n.\n\nIf N is prime, the order divides N-1, so n <= N-1, which is large, but our n is logarithmic, so for large N, order can be large.\n\nIf N is composite, order could be small.\n\nTo ensure, we need that the multiplicative order of r modulo N/gcd(N,r) is large, but it might be that for some N, no r has large order.\n\nHowever, for the existence of such a set, we can still achieve n about log_{K+2} N by choosing r appropriately.\n\nMoreover, in the sum, we have |S| < N only if K (r^n -1)/(r-1) < N, but if not, it might still work as long as no sum is divisible by N, but in the geometric progression, if a sum is divisible by N, it might be zero mod N.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose r large enough so that the minimal |S| for non-zero m is large, but it's complicated.\n\nIn the case where the powers are distinct, and r > K+1, then S \u22600 for non-zero m, and if we choose r such that r is large, but then n is small.\n\nTo get larger n, we need smaller r, but r>K+1.\n\nEarlier with r=K+2.\n\nNow, is this the maximal possible?\n\nFrom the initial pigeonhole argument, if (2K+1)^n > N, then there are two different m vectors with the same sum mod N, so their difference gives sum m'_i a_i \u22610 with |m'_i| <= 2K.\n\nBut since we need for |m_i| <= K, and 2K > K, it doesn't give a contradiction.\n\nTo force a solution with coefficients bounded by K, we need a stronger bound.\n\nI recall that in additive combinatorics, for the equation sum m_i a_i \u22610 mod N with |m_i|<=K, the maximal n is given by the size where the sumset covers the whole group or something.\n\nA theorem by Meshulam or others, but I think there is a result.\n\nI remember that the critical size is when (2K+1)^n > N, but with the coefficient bound.\n\nAnother way: the number of possible sums is at most (2K+1)^n, but since the group has size N, if (2K+1)^n > N, then by pigeonhole, some residue is hit twice, so there are m1 \u2260 m2 with sum m1_i a_i \u2261 sum m2_i a_i mod N, so sum (m1_i - m2_i) a_i \u22610 mod N, with |m1_i - m2_i| <= 2K, and not all zero.\n\nBut again, |diff| <= 2K, while we need <=K.\n\nTo get <=K, we need that the map is injective modulo N, which requires (2K+1)^n <= N.\n\nBut if (2K+1)^n <= N, then the map from [-K,K]^n to Z/NZ is injective only if the sums are all distinct mod N, which may not hold, but if it is injective, then certainly the only solution to sum=0 is m=0.\n\nMoreover, if (2K+1)^n <= N, it may be possible to choose a_i such that the sums are all distinct mod N.\n\nFor example, in the geometric progression with ratio r large, but if r large, (2K+1)^n may be large.\n\nBut in our earlier construction, with geometric progression, we have n about log_{r} N with r=K+2, while (2K+1)^n grows faster, so for large K, log_{K+2} N is larger than the n where (2K+1)^n <= N.\n\nFor example, K=1, (2*1+1)^n=3^n <=N, so n <= log3 N, while with geometric, r=3, n <= log3 N approximately, same as before? For K=1, r=K+2=3, then K (r^n -1)/(r-1) =1*(3^n -1)/2 < N.\n\nFor large N, 3^n /2 < N, so n < log3 (2N) \u2248 log3 N.\n\nWith pigeonhole, 3^n <= N, so same order.\n\nBut in the geometric case, with r=3, for N large, we can achieve n such that 3^n < 2N, while pigeonhole suggests n such that 3^n <= N, so geometric gives almost the same.\n\nMoreover, with geometric, we need the powers distinct, which requires that 3 has order at least n mod N, which for prime N, is possible if n| N-1, but not always for all N.\n\nBut for existence, we can choose the a_i not necessarily powers, but just a set where the sums are distinct.\n\nIn fact, any Sidon set or something, but for linear combinations, it's more.\n\nThe condition that all sums sum m_i a_i with |m_i|<=K are distinct mod N is sufficient, and necessary for the injectivity.\n\nIf all these sums are distinct mod N, then in particular, 0 is hit only by m=0.\n\nThe number of such sums is (2K+1)^n, since each m_i from -K to K.\n\nIf (2K+1)^n <= N, then it is possible to choose distinct integers a_i such that all these sums are distinct modulo N, for example by choosing a_i large and distinct, and reducing mod N, but since modulo N, we need to assign residues.\n\nIn the cyclic group, it may not be possible if N is small, but if (2K+1)^n <= N, then since the sumset has size (2K+1)^n <= N, we can in principle embed it injectively into Z/NZ, but the sums depend on the a_i.\n\nTo have the sums distinct, we need that for different coefficient vectors, the sums are different, which requires that the a_i are such that no two different linear combinations coincide.\n\nThis is equivalent to the set being a \"basis with bounded coefficients\" and the differences generating no relations.\n\nA standard way is to choose a_i growing fast, like geometric progression.\n\nIn fact, with geometric progression with ratio r > 2K, then the sums are all distinct, as we had earlier with r > K+1, since |D|=2K+1 < r if r > 2K.\n\nFor the digit set D = {-K, -K+1, ..., K}, size 2K+1.\n\nIf r > 2K, then |D| = 2K+1 <= 2K < r? 2K+1 > 2K, so if r > 2K, but 2K+1 may be greater than r if r=2K+1, but |D|=2K+1, so if r >= 2K+2, then |D| < r, and since |D| = r -1 < r, then indeed, the representation is unique: each integer has at most one representation in base r with digits in D, and in particular, for fixed n, all sums are distinct.\n\nMoreover, if we choose r large, but to maximize n, we choose minimal r such that r >= 2K+2? r integer, so r >= 2K+2.\n\nThen |D| = 2K+1 < r, since r >= 2K+2 > 2K+1.\n\nThen the sums sum d_i r^i for i=0 to n-1 with d_i in D are all distinct integers, as long as they are in the range, but since distinct integers, they are distinct mod any N.\n\nMoreover, the maximal sum is K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1}, minimal -K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1}.\n\nTo have them distinct mod N, since they are distinct integers, as long as the range is less than N, but if the range is larger than N, they might coincide mod N, but since they are distinct integers, if the difference between max and min is less than N, then they are all distinct mod N. Otherwise, not necessarily.\n\nThe difference between max and min is 2K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1}.\n\nIf this is less than N, then all sums are distinct mod N.\n\nBut if not, they might not be distinct mod N.\n\nIn that case, we might have collisions.\n\nBut in our case, for the geometric progression itself, if we take a_i = r^{i-1}, then the sums are exactly these integers, so if they are distinct, then in Z, they are distinct, so modulo N, they are distinct as long as no two differ by multiple of N, but since distinct, if the difference is not multiple of N, but if two sums differ by N, then they are congruent mod N.\n\nTo prevent that, we need that no two different sums differ by a multiple of N, but since the sums can be large, it's hard.\n\nTo ensure, we need that the range is less than N, i.e., 2K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1} < N.\n\nThen all sums are distinct and between min and max, so distinct mod N.\n\nMoreover, the sum is 0 only when all d_i=0.\n\nSo with r >= 2K+2, and 2K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1} < N, then the set works.\n\nMinimal r is 2K+2.\n\nThen n such that 2K \\frac{(2K+2)^n -1}{(2K+2)-1} = 2K \\frac{(2K+2K)^n -1}{2K+1} < N.\n\nSince (2K+2)^n -1 < (2K+2)^n, and 2K/(2K+1) <1, so (2K+2)^n < N \\frac{2K+1}{2K} \u2248 N, so n < log_{2K+2} N.\n\nCompared to earlier with r=K+2, which gave n < log_{K+2} N, and since 2K+2 = 2(K+1) > K+2 for K>0, so log_{2K+2} N < log_{K+2} N, so the earlier bound is larger.\n\nIn the earlier construction with r=K+2, we had r>K+1, so r>=K+2, and |S| < N for the sums, and S\u22600 for non-zero m.\n\nIn that case, with r=K+2, |D| for the coefficients is not fixed; in the linear combination, the coefficients m_i are bounded by K, so the \"digit set\" for each position is {-K,...,K}, size 2K+1.\n\nIn the geometric sum sum m_i r^{i-1}, with |m_i|<=K.\n\nThe base is r, digits in D={-K,...,K}, size 2K+1.\n\nFor the sum to be unique for each coefficient vector, we need that |D| < r, i.e., 2K+1 < r.\n\nBut r=K+2, and 2K+1 > K+2 for K>1, since 2K+1 - (K+2)=K-1>0 for K>1.\n\nSo for K=1, r=3, |D|=3, r=3, so |D|=r, not less.\n\nWhen |D|=r, the representation may not be unique.\n\nFor example, with r=3, K=1, D={-1,0,1}, size 3=r.\n\nThen sum m_i 3^{i-1}.\n\nFor example, n=2, elements a1=1 (3^0), a2=3 (3^1).\n\nSums: m1,m2 in {-1,0,1}, sum m1*1 + m2*3.\n\nPossible sums: 0,1,3,-1,-3,1+3=4,1-3=-2,-1+3=2,-1-3=-4.\n\nAll distinct? -4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4. Yes, all distinct integers.\n\nBut |D|=r=3, and here it is unique.\n\nIs it always unique when |D|=r?\n\nFor example, n=1: sums -1,0,1, distinct.\n\nn=2: as above, distinct.\n\nn=3: elements 1,3,9.\n\nSums: min -1-3-9=-13, max 13, all integers from -13 to 13? With digits -1,0,1, it should represent all integers in [- (3^n -1)/2, (3^n -1)/2 ], for n=3, (27-1)/2=13, and yes, all integers from -13 to 13 are represented uniquely? For example, 1 =1, 2=3-1, but 2 = m1*1 + m2*3 + m3*9, with |m_i|<=1. 2=3-1, so m3=0,m2=1,m1=-1. But also, is there another? 2=2*1, but |m1|=2>1 not allowed. So yes, unique.\n\nIn fact, for base r, with digits symmetric around zero, if |D|=r, and D is a complete residue system, but here D={-1,0,1} for r=3, which is not the standard {0,1,2}, but still, it can represent all integers in a range uniquely.\n\nSpecifically, for base r, with digits from -floor((r-1)/2) to ceil((r-1)/2), but in this case, for r odd, it can be symmetric.\n\nIn general, for r odd, with digits from -(r-1)/2 to (r-1)/2, size r, and it gives unique representation for integers in [- (r^n -1)/2, (r^n -1)/2 ].\n\nIn our case, for r=K+2, if r is odd, and we set D from -floor(r/2) to floor(r/2), but we have |m_i|<=K, and r=K+2.\n\nFor example K=1, r=3, floor(r/2)=1, so D={-1,0,1}, same as |m_i|<=1.\n\nFor K=2, r=4? But r=K+2=4, |D| for coefficients should be |m_i|<=2, so D={-2,-1,0,1,2}, size 5, while r=4, |D|=5>4.\n\nNow, is the representation unique? Sum m_i 4^{i-1} with |m_i|<=2|.\n\nFor n=1, sums -2,-1,0,1,2.\n\nFor n=2, a1=1,a2=4.\n\nSums: m1*1 + m2*4, |m1|<=2,|m2|<=2.\n\nPossible sums: min -2-8=-10, max 10.\n\nNow, is 0 represented? Only m1=m2=0? But also m1=4,m2=-1, but |m1|=4>2 not allowed. With |m_i|<=2, the sums: for example, 0: m1=0,m2=0.\n\n1: m1=1,m2=0.\n\n2: m1=2,m2=0.\n\n3: ? m1=3 not allowed. m1=-1,m2=1: -1+4=3.\n\n4: m1=0,m2=1.\n\n5: m1=1,m2=1.\n\n6: m1=2,m2=1 or m1=-2,m2=2: -2+8=6.\n\n7: m1=3 not, m1=-1,m2=2: -1+8=7.\n\n8: m1=0,m2=2.\n\n9: m1=1,m2=2.\n\n10: m1=2,m2=2.\n\nNow negatives: -1: m1=-1,m2=0.\n\n-2: m1=-2,m2=0.\n\n-3: m1=1,m2=-1:1-4=-3.\n\n-4: m1=0,m2=-1.\n\n-5: m1=-1,m2=-1.\n\n-6: m1=-2,m2=-1 or m1=2,m2=-2:2-8=-6.\n\n-7: m1=1,m2=-2:1-8=-7? |m2|=2<=2, yes.\n\nm1=1,m2=-2:1-8=-7.\n\nm1=-3 not, so yes.\n\n-8: m1=0,m2=-2.\n\n-9: m1=-1,m2=-2.\n\n-10: m1=-2,m2=-2.\n\nNow, are there duplicates? For example, sum=0: only (0,0).\n\nSum=1: (1,0)\n\nSum=2: (2,0)\n\nSum=3: (-1,1)\n\nSum=4: (0,1)\n\nSum=5: (1,1)\n\nSum=6: (2,1) or (-2,2)? (-2,2): -2 + 8=6, and (2,1):2+4=6. Oh! Both give 6.\n\nSo (m1,m2)=(2,1) sum=2*1 +1*4=2+4=6\n\n(m1,m2)=(-2,2) sum=-2*1 +2*4=-2+8=6.\n\nSame sum. So not unique.\n\nAnd if we set a1=1,a2=4, then sum m_i a_i =6 for both, so same.\n\nMoreover, if N divides 6, say N=6, then it is 0 mod 6.\n\nBut in general, if two different m give same sum, then their difference gives sum to 0 with coefficients difference.\n\nHere, m1=(2,1), m2=(-2,2), difference (4,-1), |diff_i|=4 and 1, which may be larger than K=2.\n\nBut in this case, for the sum to be equal, but for our purpose, if two different coefficient vectors give the same sum, then that sum is hit, but for the sum to be 0 mod N, it might not be.\n\nBut in the condition, we need that no non-trivial m gives sum \u22610 mod N, but here, for example, if we compute the sum for m=(2,1): 2*1 +1*4=6, for m=(-2,2): -2*1 +2*4=6, same.\n\nBut 6 may not be 0 mod N.\n\nTo have sum \u22610, we need that some sum is divisible by N.\n\nIn the geometric set, if the sums are not all distinct, but as long as no sum is 0 and no non-zero sum is divisible by N, it might be ok, but in this case for n=2, K=2, r=4, sums include 6, which if N|6, bad, else ok.\n\nBut for larger n, it might be bad.\n\nBack to the unique representation.\n\nTo have unique representation, we need |D| < r, i.e., 2K+1 < r.\n\nSo r >= 2K+2.\n\nThen with r=2K+2, |D|=2K+1 < r, so unique representation: each sum is distinct integer.\n\nThen the sums range from -K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1} to K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1}.\n\nThe difference between max and min is 2K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1}.\n\nIf this is less than N, then all sums are distinct mod N, and in particular, 0 is hit only once.\n\nMoreover, since the sums are non-zero for non-zero m, and |sum| < N, not divisible by N.\n\nSo with r=2K+2, and 2K \\frac{(2K+2)^n -1}{2K+1} < N.\n\nSince (2K+2)^n -1 < (2K+2)^n, and 2K/(2K+1) <1, so (2K+2)^n < N \\frac{2K+1}{2K} \u2248 N.\n\nThus n < \\log_{2K+2} \\left( N \\frac{2K+1}{2K} \\right)\n\nFor the earlier construction with r=K+2, we had a bound but not necessarily unique, but for K>1, it didn't satisfy |D| < r.\n\nBut in the case where we don't require unique sums, we might get larger n.\n\nFor example, with r=K+2, and if r > K+1, then sum \u22600 for non-zero m, as we had |S| >=1.\n\nThen if the maximal |sum| < N, then |sum| < N, so not divisible by N.\n\nMaximal |sum| is K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1} = K \\frac{(K+2)^n -1}{K+1}\n\nSet this < N.\n\nFor K=1, r=3, max sum K (r^n -1)/(r-1) =1*(3^n -1)/2\n\nSet < N, so 3^n < 2N +1\n\nWhile with r=2K+2=4, max sum K (r^n -1)/(r-1) =1*(4^n -1)/3\n\nSet < N, so 4^n < 3N +1\n\nFor large N, n can be larger with smaller r, but for r=3, n ~ log3 (2N), for r=4, n ~ log4 (3N) = (log2 (3N)) / 2\n\nlog3 (2N) vs (log2 (3N))/2\n\nSince log2 N / log2 3 \u2248 log3 N, and (log2 N)/2, and log2 3 \u22481.584, so 1/1.584 \u22480.63, while 1/2=0.5, so log3 N > (log2 N)/2 for N large, so with r=3 we get larger n than with r=4 for K=1.\n\nAnd in that case, for K=1, r=3, we can achieve n such that (3^n -1)/2 < N, and if the powers are distinct mod N, which we can ensure by choosing r coprime to N or something.\n\nNow for the sum to be not divisible by N, we need that no sum is 0 mod N, but since |sum| < N and sum integer, if sum \u22600, then not divisible by N, which is satisfied as long as max |sum| < N and min |non-zero sum| >=1, which is true if r > K+1.\n\nIn the geometric set, with r>K+1, sum \u22600 for non-zero m.\n\nAnd if max |sum| < N, then |sum| < N for all such sums, so for non-zero sum, |sum| < N and sum \u22600, so not divisible by N.\n\nThus, with r = K+2 (since r integer > K+1), and K \\frac{(K+2)^n -1}{K+1} < N, and if the set {r^0, r^1, ..., r^{n-1}} are distinct modulo N.\n\nTo ensure distinctness, we need that r^i not \u2261 r^j mod N for i\u2260j, which is equivalent to N not dividing r^j (r^{|i-j|} -1) for any i>j.\n\nThis can be avoided by choosing r such that r is coprime to N, and the multiplicative order is at least n, but if n is large, order might be small.\n\nFor existence, since N is fixed, and we need large n, we can choose r large, but then n small.\n\nTo maximize n, we fix r=K+2, and choose it coprime to N if possible.\n\nBut if N and r are not coprime, it might still work as long as no two powers are equal mod N.\n\nThe number of distinct powers is min(n, order of r mod N/gcd(N,r)).\n\nBut to have n large, we need the order large.\n\nThe maximal possible n is at least the maximum over r of the largest n such that the powers are distinct and the sum bound holds.\n\nBut for the largest possible n in the problem, we can take r=K+2, and n such that K \\frac{(K+2)^n -1}{K+1} < N, and since for large N, there exists r with large order, but actually, for the set to exist, we can take the geometric progression with r=K+2, and as long as the powers are distinct mod N, which requires that n is less than or equal to the smallest i such that r^i \u2261 r^j for some j<i, but for most N, if r is coprime, order can be up to phi(N), which is large.\n\nTo be safe, we can always achieve n such that (K+2)^n <= N, for example, since if (K+2)^n <= N, then the powers r^0 to r^{n-1} are all less than (K+2)^n <= N, so distinct integers between 1 and N-1, so distinct mod N. And max sum is K \\frac{(K+2)^n -1}{K+1} <= K \\frac{N -1}{K+1} < N for N large, but for small N, may not hold, but in this case since (K+2)^n <= N, and K/(K+1) <1, so K (N-1)/(K+1) < N if N>1, yes.\n\nFor example, K=1, (3)^n <= N, max sum (3^n -1)/2 <= (N-1)/2 < N for N>1.\n\nAnd sums are distinct as integers, so distinct mod N, and non-zero sum not divisible by N.\n\nSo with r=K+2, and n such that (K+2)^n <= N, we can achieve n = floor( \\log_{K+2} N )\n\nBut is this the maximal?\n\nEarlier for K=1, N=10, \\log_3 10 \u22482.095, floor=2, but we achieved n=3 with S={1,2,4}, and 3^3=27>10, but max sum for n=3 is (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13>10, and indeed 1+2+4=7<10, but 8+4? Elements 1,2,4, sum with m1=0,m2=0,m3=2? |m_i|<=K=1, so max sum 1+2+4=7<10, min -7, so |sum|<=7<10, and no sum=0 non-trivially, so it works. But (K+2)^n=3^3=27>10, so our condition (K+2)^n <= N is not satisfied, but still, max sum is small because in this set, the \"ratio\" is not constant; in S={1,2,4}, it's geometric with ratio 2, but r=2, while K+2=3.\n\nWith r=2, K=1, then r=2>K+1=2? r>K+1? 2>2 false, so r=2 not greater than K+1=2.\n\nBut in this case, with r=2, sum m_i 2^{i-1}, |m_i|<=1.\n\nFor n=3, sums from -7 to 7, all integers? For example, 3=2+1, but also 4-1, so m for 4: m3, for 2: m2, for 1: m1.\n\nSum m1*1 + m2*2 + m3*4.\n\nTo get 3: m1=-1,m2=0,m3=1: -1+0+4=3? Or m1=1,m2=1,m3=0:1+2=3. So two representations: (m1,m2,m3)=(1,1,0) and (-1,0,1), both give sum 3.\n\nBut sum is 3, not 0. And 0 is only (0,0,0). So no problem. And |sum|<=7<10, so for N=10, it works.\n\nWith r=K+2=3, we could take n=2, since 3^2=9<10, S={1,3}, sums: m1*1 + m2*3, |m_i|<=1, sums -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4? m1=1,m2=1:4, m1=-1,m2=1:-1+3=2, etc. All distinct, |sum|<=4<10, good, but n=2<3, so smaller than with r=2.\n\nSo by choosing a different ratio, we get larger n.\n\nIn this case, with r=2< K+2=3, and r>K+1? K+1=2, r=2 not greater than 2.\n\nBut r=K+1=2.\n\nFor r=K+1, is sum always non-zero for non-zero m?\n\nWith r=2,K=1, sum m_i 2^{i-1}.\n\nSuppose sum m_i 2^{i-1} =0.\n\nFor example, n=2: m1*1 + m2*2=0. Possible? m1=2,m2=-1, but |m1|=2>1 not allowed. With |m_i|<=1, solutions: m1=0,m2=0; or m1=2,m2=-1 not allowed. So no non-trivial solution. For n=3, as above, no sum to 0.\n\nBut is it always true? Suppose n=1, sum m1*1=0, so m1=0.\n\nn=2, as above.\n\nn=3, sum m1*1 + m2*2 + m3*4=0.\n\nWith |m_i|<=1, possible? Suppose m3=0, then m1+2m2=0, only m1=m2=0. m3=1, then m1+2m2+4=0, so m1+2m2=-4, |m1+2m2|<=1+2=3<4, no solution. m3=-1, m1+2m2=4, |m1+2m2|<=3<4, no. So yes.\n\nIn general, for geometric with ratio r, sum m_i r^{i-1}=0.\n\nLet j be the highest index with m_j \u22600. Then |m_j| r^{j-1} = |sum_{i<j} m_i r^{i-1}| <= sum_{i<j} |m_i| r^{i-1} <= K \\frac{r^{j-1} -1}{r-1}\n\nSo |m_j| r^{j-1} <= K \\frac{r^{j-1} -1}{r-1} < K \\frac{r^{j-1}}{r-1}\n\nSince |m_j| >=1, so r^{j-1} < K \\frac{r^{j-1}}{r-1}, so 1 < K / (r-1), i.e., r-1 < K.\n\nThus, if r-1 >= K, then no solution except m=0.\n\nIn other words, if r >= K+1, then for any n, the only solution to sum m_i r^{i-1} =0 with |m_i|<=K is m_i=0 for all i.\n\nMoreover, for the sums to be distinct mod N, we need that no two sums are congruent mod N, but to ensure that no sum is divisible by N, we need that the minimal non-zero |sum| is large, but if the sums are small, it might be ok.\n\nSpecifically, the maximal |sum| is K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1}.\n\nIf this is less than N, then since |sum| < N for all sums, and sum=0 only for m=0, so for non-zero sum, 0 < |sum| < N, so not divisible by N.\n\nThus, with r >= K+1 integer, and K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1} < N, and the powers r^0 to r^{n-1} distinct mod N.\n\nTo maximize n, we choose r as small as possible, i.e., r = K+1.\n\nThen n such that K \\frac{(K+1)^n -1}{K} = (K+1)^n -1 < N? Since K / K =1.\n\nK * \\frac{(K+1)^n -1}{r-1} = K * \\frac{(K+1)^n -1}{K} = (K+1)^n -1 < N.\n\nSo (K+1)^n < N +1.\n\nThus n < \\log_{K+1} (N+1)\n\nAnd we can take n = floor( \\log_{K+1} (N) ) or something, but approximately.\n\nFor example, K=1, r=2, then (1+1)^n = 2^n < N? But earlier for N=10, 2^3=8<10? 8<10, but n=3, (2^3 -1)=7<10, yes. S={1,2,4}, works.\n\nFor K=2, r=3, then (3^n -1) < N? Since K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1} =2 * \\frac{3^n -1}{2} = 3^n -1 < N.\n\nSo n such that 3^n < N+1.\n\nFor example, N=10, 3^2=9<11, n=2, S={1,3}, sums with |m_i|<=2: max 2*1+2*3=8, min -8, sums include 1+3=4, 2*1=2, etc. Is there sum to 0? m1=3,m2=-1 but |m1|=3>2 not allowed. With |m_i|<=2, solutions to m1*1 + m2*3=0. Then m1 = -3 m2, so |m1|=3|m2|, if m2=0, m1=0; m2=1, m1=-3, |m1|=3>2; m2=-1,m1=3>2. So no non-trivial solution. Max |sum|=8<10? 2*1 + 2*3=8<10, or 2*1 + (-2)*3=2-6=-4, etc, all |sum|<=8<10, so not divisible by 10. So n=2. But can we take n=3? 3^3=27>10+1? 27>11, but (K+1)^n=3^3=27> N+1=11, so condition not satisfied. If we try S={1,3,9} mod 10. Residues 1,3,9. Sums with |m_i|<=2. Max |sum|=2*1+2*3+2*9=2+6+18=26. Possible sums: for example, m1=1,m2=1,m3=2? |m3|=2, sum1+3+18=22. Or to get 0: suppose m1*1 + m2*3 + m3*9 \u22610 mod 10. With small coefficients. Note that 9\u2261 -1, 3\u22613,1\u22611. So m1 + 3 m2 - m3 \u22610 mod 10. With |m_i|<=2. Possible solutions: if m3=0, then m1+3m2\u22610 mod 10. |m1+3m2|<=2+6=8<10, so only if m1+3m2=0, which requires m1=0,m2=0 as before. m3=1, then m1+3m2 -1\u22610, so m1+3m2\u22611. Possible: m2=0,m1=1; m2=1,m1=-2? |m1|=2, sum1+0-1=0? m1=1,m2=0,m3=1:1+0+9=10\u22610. Oh, and |m_i|=1<=2. So sum=1*1 + 0*3 +1*9=1+9=10\u22610 mod 10. So indeed, for n=3, with this set, it doesn't work. But is there another set? Suppose we take r=4> K+1=3. Then with r=4, n such that 2 * \\frac{4^n -1}{3} < N. For N=10, n=1: 2*(4-1)/3=2*3/3=2<10, S={1}, but n=1 small. n=2: 2*(16-1)/3=2*15/3=10, but 10 not less than 10? We need < N? 10 <10 false. Max sum |sum|=2*1 + 2*4=10? Elements 1 and 4. Sums: m1*1 + m2*4, |m_i|<=2. Max 2+8=10, min -10. Now, if sum=10, which is 0 mod 10. For example, m1=2,m2=2:2*1+2*4=2+8=10\u22610. So indeed, sum=0 mod 10. So doesn't work. With r=5>3, n=1: max sum 2*1=2<10, S={1}, n=1. Or n=2: 2*(25-1)/4? r-1=4, K=2, max |sum|=K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1}=2*(25-1)/4=2*24/4=12>10. And sums include m1=2,m2=2:2*1+2*5=12\u22612\u22600, but also m1=0,m2=2:10\u22610? 2*5=10\u22610. So if N|10, bad. For N=10, yes. So only n=1 or 2 with r=3, but n=2 with r=3 gives S={1,3}, works, but earlier with r=2 we could get n=3 for K=1, but for K=2, with r=2? r=K+1=3? But r=2< K+1=3? 2<3, so r=2 not >= K+1=3. If we try geometric with r=2, K=2. Then S={1,2,4,...} sum m_i 2^{i-1}, |m_i|<=2. For n=1: S={1}, sums -2,-1,0,1,2, so if |m1|=2, sum=2 or -2, not 0 unless N|2. For N=10>2, ok. n=2: S={1,2}, sums m1*1 + m2*2, |m_i|<=2. Possible sum to 0: m1+2m2=0. Solutions: m1=0,m2=0; m1=2,m2=-1:2-2=0; |m1|=2<=2, |m2|=1<=2. So sum=0. Always. So for any set containing 1 and 2, if K>=2, then m1=2,m2=-1 gives 2*1 + (-1)*2=0. So cannot use r=2 for K>=2. Thus for K=2, we need r>=3. For N=10, with r=3, n=2, S={1,3}, works. Can we get n=3? Suppose we try non-geometric set. Say S={1,4,5} mod 10. Then with |m_i|<=2, is there sum to 0? m1*1 + m2*4 + m3*5 \u22610 mod 10. Possible: if m3=0, m1+4m2\u22610. |m1+4m2|<=2+8=10, so possible m1=0,m2=0; or m1=4,m2=-1 but |m1|=4>2 not; or m1=2,m2=-0.5 not integer. With integers, m2=0,m1=0; m2=1,m1=-4>2 not; etc. No solution. m3=1, then m1+4m2+5\u22610, so m1+4m2\u2261-5\u22615 mod 10. Possible m2=1,m1=1:1+4=5; so m1=1,m2=1,m3=1:1+4+5=10\u22610. Oh, bad. S={2,3,4}: m1=2,m2=1,m3=-1? |m3|=1, sum 2*2 +1*3 + (-1)*4=4+3-4=3\u22600. Or m1=1,m2=2,m3=0:2+6=8. Is 0 possible? Suppose 2a+3b+4c\u22610. With |a|,|b|,|c|<=2. Try values: if c=0, 2a+3b\u22610. Possible a=3,b=-2 not; a=0,b=0; no. c=1, 2a+3b+4\u22610, so 2a+3b\u22616. a=3,b=0:6\u22616, but |a|=3>2. a=0,b=2:6\u22616, |b|=2, sum 0*2 +2*3 +1*4=0+6+4=10\u22610. Oh, yes. Bad. S={1,2,3}: then 2*1 + (-1)*2 +0*3=0, bad as before. S={3,5,7}: m1=1,m2=1,m3=1:3+5+7=15\u22615\u22600. m1=2,m2=0,m3=-1:6-7=-1\u22600. m1=1,m2=-1,m3=0:3-5=-2. Is there? Suppose 3a+5b+7c\u22610. With |a|,|b|,|c|<=2. c=0:3a+5b\u22610. |3a+5b|<=6+10=16, possible a=5,b=-3 not; no small solution. c=1:3a+5b+7\u22610, 3a+5b\u22613. a=1,b=0:3\u22613, so m1=1,m2=0,m3=1:3+0+7=10\u22610. Bad. S={4,5,6}: m1=1,m2=1,m3=1:15\u22615. m1=2,m2=0,m3=-1:8-6=2. m1=0,m2=2,m3=-1:10-6=4. m1=1,m2=-1,m3=0:4-5=-1. But 5+5=10\u22610, but only one 5? m2=2 for 5: 2*5=10\u22610, so if I set m2=2, others 0, sum=10\u22610. And |m2|=2<=K=2. So bad. Similarly, any set containing a multiple of 5? Not necessarily. Suppose S={1,3,7}. Then sums: m1=1,m2=1,m3=1:1+3+7=11\u22611. m1=2,m2=0,m3=-1:2-7=-5\u22615. m1=0,m2=2,m3=-1:6-7=-1. m1=1,m2=2,m3=-1:1+6-7=0. Oh, 1+6-7=7-7=0? m1=1,m2=2,m3=-1: sum1*1 +2*3 + (-1)*7=1+6-7=0. Yes. Bad. S={1,6,7}: m1=1,m2=1,m3=1:14\u22614. m1=2,m2=0,m3=-1:2-7=-5. m1=1,m2=2,m3=-1:1+12-7=6\u22600. m1=0,m2=1,m3=-1:6-7=-1. m1=3? not. But 7+3? not. Suppose we solve: a*1 + b*6 + c*7 \u22610 mod 10. With |a|,|b|,|c|<=2. Possible solutions: if c=0, a+6b\u22610. |a+6b|<=2+12=14. a=0,b=0; a=2,b=-2? 2-12=-10\u22610, so a=2,b=-2,c=0:2*1 + (-2)*6 +0*7=2-12=-10\u22610. And |a|=2,|b|=2<=2. So bad. Thus for N=10,K=2, maximal n is 2. With r=K+1=3, (K+1)^n=3^n < N+1=11, 3^2=9<11, n=2, and we achieved it. Now, is there a set with n=3? From above trials, seems not, but perhaps. Suppose S={3,4,8}. Then sums: m1=1,m2=1,m3=1:3+4+8=15\u22615. m1=2,m2=0,m3=-1:6-8=-2. m1=0,m2=2,m3=-1:8-8=0? m2=2 for 4: 2*4=8, m3=-1 for 8: -1*8, so sum 0*3 +2*4 + (-1)*8=0+8-8=0. Bad. S={2,5,8}: m1=1,m2=1,m3=1:2+5+8=15\u22615. m1=2,m2=0,m3=-1:4-8=-4. m1=1,m2=2,m3=-1:2+10-8=4. m1=0,m2=1,m3=-1:5-8=-3. But 5+5=10\u22610, so if m2=2, sum=2*5=10\u22610. Bad. S={1,5,9}: 1+9=10\u22610, bad. S={3,5,9}: 3+7? not. 5+5=10, bad. S={1,7,8}: 1+7=8, so 1+7-8=0, bad. S={4,7,9}: 4+6? not. Solve 4a+7b+9c\u22610. |a|,|b|,|c|<=2. c=0:4a+7b\u22610. Possible? a=7,b=-4 not; no. c=1:4a+7b+9\u22614a+7b-1\u22610? Since 9\u2261-1, so 4a+7b\u22611. Possible a=2,b=-1:8-7=1, so a=2,b=-1,c=1:4*2 +7*(-1) +9*1=8-7+9=10\u22610. Bad. So seems difficult. Assume there is such a set of size 3. Then the sums must avoid 0 mod 10. The number of non-trivial coefficient vectors is (2*2+1)^3 -1=125-1=124? Each m_i from -2,-1,0,1,2, so 5 choices, 5^3=125, minus 1 for zero vector, so 124 vectors. Each gives a sum mod 10, which has 10 possibilities. By pigeonhole, some residue is hit at least 124/10=12.4, so at least 13 times. But that doesn't force a sum to 0. Since 0 is one residue, it might be hit or not. But without the zero vector, the sums could avoid 0. For example, if all sums are odd, but not necessarily. The minimal sum is -2-2-2=-6 for some sets, but depends. In any case, from trials, it seems hard, and likely n=2 is maximal for K=2,N=10. With the formula, \\log_{K+1} N = \\log_3 10 \\approx 2.095, floor=2, and we have n=2. For K=1,N=10, \\log_2 10 \\approx 3.32, floor=3, achieved. Now for the original problem, N>K, and K fixed. In the geometric construction, we need the powers distinct mod N. If we choose r coprime to N, and order large, but in the bound, with r=K+1, n < \\log_{K+1} (N+1) But since the powers must be distinct, and there are n of them, as long as n <= N, but more constraining is the sum bound. To achieve n = floor( \\log_{K+1} N ) , but for example K=1,N=10, log2 10\u22483.32, floor=3, and we achieved. For K=2,N=10, log3 10\u22482.095, floor=2, achieved. Is this always possible? That is, can we always find a geometric progression with ratio r=K+1, and n such that (K+1)^n <= N? Since if (K+1)^n <= N, then the powers 1, r, r^2, ..., r^{n-1} are all distinct integers between 1 and N-1 (since r>=2 for K>=1), so distinct mod N. And max sum |sum| <= K \\frac{r^n -1}{r-1} <= K \\frac{N -1}{K} = N -1 < N, since r-1=K. r=K+1, r-1=K. So max |sum| = K \\frac{r^n -1}{K} = r^n -1 <= N-1 < N. And as before, sum \u22600 for non-zero m, so it works. Moreover, n = floor( \\log_{K+1} N ) , since (K+1)^n <= N, and (K+1)^{n+1} > N. But is this the largest possible? Suppose we try to get larger n. For example, K=1,N=10, n=4. Earlier we tried and failed, but is it possible? Suppose there is a set S of 4 distinct residues mod 10, no 0, and no non-trivial |m_i|<=1 sum to 0 mod 10. As before, no two sum to 0 or 10, but since no two sum to 10 (as 10\u22610), and no element 0. Also, no three sum to 0, etc. The possible sums with coefficients -1,0,1: each sum is at least -10, at most 10, but since |sum| could be up to sum |a_i|, but if a_i large, but mod 10. The sum sum m_i a_i with |m_i|<=1, not all zero. The number of such sums is 3^4 -1=81-1=80, and they are in [-10,10] say, but mod 10, so residues. Since 80 > 10, and by pigeonhole, some residue hit multiple times, but not necessarily 0. However, in this range, the possible sums are integers from -10 to 10, excluding some, but 21 possible integers, 80 sums, so average about 4 per residue, but 0 is one residue. But we need to avoid 0. But earlier attempts failed, and likely impossible. To confirm, suppose we list all possible sums. But perhaps assume it's possible. Note that for any two elements, their difference should not be zero, but since distinct, ok. But also, no element should be sum of others with signs, but complicated. I recall that for the cyclic group, the maximal size without a solution to sum m_i a_i=0 with |m_i|<=K is indeed O( \\log N ) with constant depending on K. But in our case, with the construction, we have n = \\log_{K+1} N approximately. Now for the upper bound. What is the maximal possible n? Suppose we have such a set S. Consider the set of all linear combinations sum m_s s with |m_s| <= K. This set has size at most (2K+1)^n, but actually, since it's a subset of Z, but modulo N. The condition is that 0 is not in the sumset except for the zero combination. Moreover, the sumset is symmetric. The size of the sumset is at least the number of non-zero combinations, but not necessarily. A better bound: the number of elements in the sumset is equal to the number of distinct sums. Since 0 is hit only once, the size is at least 1, but more relevantly, the minimal size. However, in Z/NZ, the sumset can be small. But to force that 0 is hit, we can use the Cauchy-Davenport or other theorems, but for cyclic groups, the sumset size is at least min(N, |A| + |B| -1), but here it's iterated sumset. Consider the subgroup generated, but with bounded coefficients. Note that the set of sums includes all elements that can be written as such linear combinations. The subgroup generated by S is the whole group if gcd(S,N)=1, but here it might not be. However, the set with bounded coefficients might not generate the whole group. But in any case, the size of the sumset A = { sum m_s s | |m_s| <= K } \\subset Z/NZ. This set contains 0, and since the representation is unique for 0, but for other elements, may not. The size |A| <= N. Each element in A corresponds to at least one coefficient vector. The zero vector gives 0. The other vectors give other sums. But since some sums may be hit multiple times, |A| <= number of vectors minus the multiplicity plus one or something. The total number of non-zero coefficient vectors is (2K+1)^n - 1. Each gives a sum, and these sums are not 0, by assumption. Moreover, they are in Z/NZ, which has N-1 non-zero elements? But no, sums can be 0, but by assumption, only the zero vector gives sum 0. So all non-zero vectors give non-zero sums. But multiple vectors may give the same non-zero sum. So |A| - 1 <= number of non-zero sums, which is at most N-1. But |A| is the size of the sumset, which includes 0 and the sums. Since 0 is in A, and other elements, |A| <= N. The number of non-zero vectors is (2K+1)^n - 1. Each non-zero vector gives a non-zero sum in A, so the number of such sums is at least 1, but since |A| <= N, and there is at least |A| - 1 non-zero elements in A (since 0 is in A), but actually, A contains at least one non-zero sum, but more. The sums produced by non-zero vectors are all non-zero and in A, so there are (2K+1)^n - 1 vectors mapping to |A| - 1 elements (since 0 is hit only by zero vector). The sumset A contains exactly |A| elements. 0 is hit only by the zero vector. The other elements in A \\ {0} are hit by at least one non-zero vector. The number of non-zero vectors is (2K+1)^n - 1. Each of these maps to some element in A \\ {0}, so by pigeonhole, some element in A \\ {0} is hit by at least \\frac{ (2K+1)^n - 1 }{ |A| - 1 } vectors. But this doesn't help directly. To ensure that 0 is not hit, but we already assume it's only hit once. A crucial point is that if (2K+1)^n > N, then since |A| <= N, and there are (2K+1)^n vectors, by pigeonhole, some two different vectors give the same sum, so their difference gives sum to 0 with coefficients bounded by 2K, as before. But to get coefficients bounded by K, we need a different argument. I recall that for such problems, the maximal n satisfies (K+1)^n \\leq N, or something. In our construction, we have n such that (K+1)^n \\leq N. Now, is it possible to have larger n? Suppose that n > \\log_{K+1} N, so (K+1)^n > N. Then for any set S of size n, consider the sums. Specifically, consider the set of all linear combinations with coefficients in {0,1,2,...,K}, without negatives. But we have negative coefficients. Note that the set S generates a lattice, but in Z. The minimal distance or something. Suppose that for the set S, consider the differences. But perhaps. In Z/NZ, the ball of radius K in the max norm or something. A theorem in additive combinatorics states that the maximal size of a subset without a non-trivial solution to sum m_i a_i =0 with |m_i| \\leq K is O( \\log N ) with constant depending on K. But in our case, we have exactly that constant. Moreover, in the construction, we achieve n = \\log_{K+1} N approximately, and since (K+1)^n \\leq N, and if n larger, (K+1)^n > N, then perhaps it's impossible. To see that, suppose n such that (K+1)^n > N. Then consider the set of all sums sum_{i=1}^n m_i a_i with m_i \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,K\\}. This is a set of size (K+1)^n > N, since each m_i has K+1 choices (0 to K). The sums are in Z/NZ, so by pigeonhole, two different coefficient vectors m and m' give the same sum mod N, so sum (m_i - m'_i) a_i \\equiv 0 \\mod N. Now, m and m' are different, so m - m' is not zero. Each component |m_i - m'_i| \\leq K, since both in 0 to K, so difference between -K and K. Moreover, not all differences zero. However, the differences could be zero for some components. But the vector d_i = m_i - m'_i has |d_i| \\leq K, and not all zero. But in the sum, sum d_i a_i \\equiv 0 \\mod N. Moreover, |d_i| \\leq K. But is this non-trivial? Yes, since d not zero. But in the problem, the coefficients can be negative, which is allowed, since |d_i| \\leq K. So sum d_i a_i \\equiv 0 \\mod N with |d_i| \\leq K, not all zero. This violates the condition. Therefore, if (K+1)^n > N, then for any choice of distinct integers a_i, there exists non-zero integers m_i with |m_i| \\leq K such that sum m_i a_i \\equiv 0 \\mod N. Therefore, the condition cannot hold. Conversely, if (K+1)^n \\leq N, then we can choose the geometric progression with ratio r=K+1, and it works as above. Therefore, the maximal n is the largest integer such that (K+1)^n \\leq N. In other words, n = \\floor{ \\log_{K+1} N } . But \\log_{K+1} N is the logarithm base K+1. In the geometric progression, we set r=K+1, and (K+1)^n \\leq N, so yes. And for that n, it works. Moreover, for n+1, (K+1)^{n+1} > N, so impossible. But in the inequality, we have (K+1)^n > N implies impossible, but (K+1)^n > N is not necessarily true when n = floor(log) +1, but since (K+1)^n \\leq N < (K+1)^{n+1}, so for n+1, (K+1)^{n+1} > N, since N < (K+1)^{n+1}, so yes. Therefore, the largest possible n is the largest integer such that (K+1)^n \\leq N. Now, in the problem, N > K, and K fixed, but N can be such that (K+1)^n \\leq N < (K+1)^{n+1}. Also, the a_i are distinct integers, and we assumed they are residues mod N, which is fine. In the geometric progression, they are distinct as long as the powers are distinct, which is satisfied if (K+1)^n \\leq N, since all powers are between 1 and (K+1)^{n-1} \\leq N-1, and increasing, so distinct. Moreover, as computed, the sum condition holds. Therefore, the largest n is \\floor{\\log_{K+1} N}, but more precisely, the maximal n such that (K+1)^n \\leq N. Now, to write it nicely. Since (K+1)^n \\leq N, n \\leq \\log_{K+1} N. But since n integer, n = \\floor{ \\log_{K+1} N } . But \\log_{K+1} N = \\ln N / \\ln (K+1), but in the answer, we can leave it as the largest integer n such that (K+1)^n \\leq N. Now, for the boxed answer. But in the problem, N and K are fixed, and we need the largest n. But is this correct? For example, K=1, N=10, (1+1)^n=2^n \\leq 10, 2^3=8\\leq10, 2^4=16>10, so n=3, which matches. For K=2,N=10, (2+1)^n=3^n \\leq10, 3^2=9\\leq10, 3^3=27>10, n=2, matches. What if N = (K+1)^n? Then it should work, as above. For example, K=1,N=8, then n=3, S={1,2,4}, sums max 7<8, no sum to 0 non-trivially, and distinct mod 8. But N=8, and 8\u22610, but max sum 7<8, so not divisible. But is there a sum divisible by 8? For example, 8 itself, but not in sums. So yes. Can we take n=4? (K+1)^4=16>8, so should not be possible. Indeed, any 4 distinct residues, by pigeonhole as above, since (1+1)^4? Earlier argument: with coefficients in {0,1}, but now with signs. The earlier pigeonhole used non-negative coefficients, but in the argument, we considered sums with m_i in {0,1,2,...,K}, which for K=1 is {0,1}, size 2^n. For n=4, 2^4=16>8=N, so two different subsets (without signs) have same sum mod 8, so their difference (which is sum of some elements minus sum of others) gives sum to 0 with coefficients 1 and -1, which for K=1, |m_i|=1, so violates. So yes. Therefore, the largest possible n is the largest integer such that (K+1)^n \\leq N. So the answer is the greatest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( (K+1)^n \\leq N \\). We can write it as \\( n = \\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor \\), but only if \\( (K+1)^n \\leq N < (K+1)^{n+1} \\), which is the same as the floor of log, but actually, floor of log might be less if not integer, but since \\( (K+1)^n \\leq N \\) implies \\( n \\leq \\log_{K+1} N \\), and \\( n = \\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor \\) satisfies this only if \\( (K+1)^n \\leq N \\), which is true for the floor function, but for example if N = (K+1)^k, then \\log_{K+1} N = k, and floor is k, and (K+1)^k = N \\leq N, so n=k. If N = (K+1)^k + 1, then \\log_{K+1} N > k, floor is k, and (K+1)^k \\leq N, while (K+1)^{k+1} > N, so n=k. If N = (K+1)^k - 1, then \\log_{K+1} N < k, floor is k-1? Since (K+1)^{k-1} \\leq (K+1)^k -1 < (K+1)^k, so if (K+1)^{k-1} \\leq N < (K+1)^k, then n = k-1. But \\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor = k-1, since N < (K+1)^k. And (K+1)^{k-1} \\leq N? For example K=1,N=7, (1+1)^{k}=2^k, 2^2=4, 2^3=8>7, so n=2? Since 2^2=4\\leq7. But \\log_2 7 \\approx 2.807, floor=2. And (K+1)^n=4\\leq7. But can we take n=3? 2^3=8>7, and as before, for any set of 3 distinct residues, with 2^3=8>7, so by pigeonhole with coefficients 0,1, two subsets same sum mod 7, so difference gives sum with coefficients \\pm1 to 0. So n=2 is maximal? But earlier for N=7,K=1, can we take n=3? For example, S={1,2,3}, but 1+2+3=6\\not\\equiv0, but 3-2-1=0? m1=-1,m2=-1,m3=1? But |m_i|=1, sum -1-2+3=0. Bad. S={1,2,4}, sums: max 7<7? 1+2+4=7\\equiv0, and |m_i|=1, so bad. S={1,3,4}:1+3+4=8\\equiv1\\not=0, but 4-3-1=0? m1=-1,m2=-1,m3=1? Sum -1-3+4=0. Bad. S={2,3,4}:2+3+4=9\\equiv2, 4-3-2? -1? Or 4-2=2, not 0. But 3+4=7\\equiv0, so m2=1,m3=1,m1=0:3+4=7\\equiv0. Bad. S={1,3,5}:1+3+5=9\\equiv2, 5-3-1=1\\not=0, etc. But 1+5=6, 3+3? not. Is there sum to 0? Suppose not. But earlier pigeonhole: with coefficients in {0,1}, 2^3=8>7, so two subsets same sum to 7. Since sums are between 0 and 1+3+5=9, but mod 7. Possible subsets: empty:0, {1}:1, {3}:3, {5}:5, {1,3}:4, {1,5}:6, {3,5}:8\\equiv1, same as {1}. Oh, {3,5}=8\\equiv1, {1}=1, so same sum mod 7. Then the symmetric difference: {1} and {3,5}, difference is {1} minus {3,5}, so coefficients for 1: +1 (in first not second), for 3: -1 (in second not first), for 5: -1. So sum 1*1 + (-1)*3 + (-1)*5=1-3-5=-7\\equiv0 mod 7. And |m_i|=1. So indeed, always a solution for n=3, K=1, N=7. With n=2, say S={1,2}, sums: with |m_i|<=1, sums 0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13? m1=1,m2=1:3, etc. Max |sum|=3<7, not divisible by 7. So n=2 is possible. And (K+1)^n=2^2=4\\leq7, while 2^3=8>7. So maximal n=2. And \\lfloor \\log_2 7 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.807 \\rfloor =2. So correct. Therefore, the largest possible n is the largest integer such that \\((K+1)^n \\leq N\\). So we can box the answer. But in the problem, it says \"distinct integers\", but we used residues, which is fine. Also, N>K, so K+1 >=2, so no issue with logarithm. So the answer is the greatest integer \\( n \\) satisfying \\( (K+1)^n \\leq N \\). To write it neatly.\n",

(Alternatively, as shown below, if \\(a_i \\equiv a_j \\pmod N\\), this implies a sum \\((a_j-a_i)\\) is \\(0 \\pmod N\\), which is disallowed by the argument that follows).\n\nLet \\(m_1, \\ldots, m_n\\) be integers such that \\(|m_i| \\le K\\) for all \\(i\\), and not all \\(m_i\\) are zero.\nConsider the sum \\(S = \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i a_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (K+1)^{i-1}\\).\nWe need to show that \\(S \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod N\\).\nLet's bound the sum \\(S\\):\n\\(|S| = \\left| \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (K+1)^{i-1} \\right| \\le \\sum_{i=1}^n |m_i| (K+1)^{i-1}\\).\nSince \\(|m_i| \\le K\\), we have:\n\\(|S| \\le K \\sum_{i=1}^n (K+1)^{i-1} = K \\left( \\frac{(K+1)^n - 1}{(K+1)-1} \\right) = K \\frac{(K+1)^n - 1}{K} = (K+1)^n - 1\\).\nSo, \\( -( (K+1)^n - 1 ) \\le S \\le (K+1)^n - 1 \\).\nSince \\(n = \\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor\\), we have \\((K+1)^n \\le N\\).\nTherefore, \\(|S| \\le (K+1)^n - 1 \\le N-1\\).\nIf \\(S \\equiv 0 \\pmod N\\), then \\(S\\) must be a multiple of \\(N\\). Since \\(|S| \\le N-1\\), the only multiple of \\(N\\) that \\(S\\) can be is \\(0 \\cdot N = 0\\).\nSo, \\(S \\equiv 0 \\pmod N\\) implies \\(S=0\\).\nNow we need to show that if \\(S=0\\) and \\(|m_i| \\le K\\), then all \\(m_i\\) must be zero.\nSuppose \\(S = m_1 + m_2(K+1) + m_3(K+1)^2 + \\ldots + m_n(K+1)^{n-1} = 0\\).\nWe can write \\(m_1 = -(K+1) \\left( m_2 + m_3(K+1) + \\ldots + m_n(K+1)^{n-2} \\right)\\).\nThis shows that \\(m_1\\) must be divisible by \\(K+1\\).\nHowever, we know that \\(|m_1| \\le K\\). The only integer multiple of \\(K+1\\) whose absolute value is less than or equal to \\(K\\) is \\(0\\).\nThus, \\(m_1 = 0\\).\nSubstituting \\(m_1=0\\) into the equation for \\(S\\) gives:\n\\(m_2(K+1) + m_3(K+1)^2 + \\ldots + m_n(K+1)^{n-1} = 0\\).\nSince \\(K+1 \\ge 2\\), we can divide by \\(K+1\\):\n\\(m_2 + m_3(K+1) + \\ldots + m_n(K+1)^{n-2} = 0\\).\nBy the same argument as for \\(m_1\\), we must have \\(m_2=0\\).\nRepeating this process, we find that \\(m_3=0, \\ldots, m_n=0\\).\nSo, \\(S=0\\) with \\(|m_i| \\le K\\) implies that \\(m_i=0\\) for all \\(i\\).\nThis means that if \\( \\sum m_i a_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod N \\) with \\(|m_i| \\leq K \\), then all \\(m_i\\) must be zero. This is precisely what condition (C) requires (when rephrased).\nThus, the choice \\(a_i = (K+1)^{i-1}\\) for \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\) with \\(n = \\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor\\) satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe largest possible value of \\(n\\) is therefore \\( \\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor \\).\n\nTo summarize:\n1.  We showed that any set \\(\\{a_i\\}\\) satisfying the condition must have the property that the sums \\(\\sum x_i a_i\\) for \\(x_i \\in \\{0, \\dots, K\\}\\) are all distinct modulo \\(N\\). This leads to \\( (K+1)^n \\le N \\), so \\( n \\le \\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor \\).\n2.  We showed that the set \\(a_i = (K+1)^{i-1}\\) for \\(i=1, \\dots, \\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor\\) satisfies the condition.\n    The critical steps were showing that \\( \\sum m_i a_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod N \\) implies \\( \\sum m_i a_i = 0 \\) because \\( |\\sum m_i a_i| < N \\), and then showing that \\( \\sum m_i a_i = 0 \\) with \\(|m_i| \\le K\\) implies all \\(m_i=0\\) by uniqueness of base \\(K+1\\) representations (generalized to coefficients \\(-K, \\dots, K\\)).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\lfloor \\log_{K+1} N \\rfloor}$.",

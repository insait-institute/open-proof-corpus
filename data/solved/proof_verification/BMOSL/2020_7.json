            "solution": "Solution. Evelyn has a winning strategy. Begin by noticing that any legal move by Odin involves writing an odd number $n$, so Evelyn is allowed to replace it with the even number $n-1$. In particular, the game cannot end because Evelyn is unable to move.\n\nEvelyn's strategy is described in terms of the following valuation: Collect the numbers in all non-empty boxes to form $\\mathbf{a}=\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{\\ell}\\right)$, where $\\ell \\leqslant 3 k$, and define the valuation of a by\n\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{a})=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell}(-1 / 2)^{a_{i}} .\n$$\n\nNotice that when Odin makes a move, the valuation strictly decreases; and when Evelyn makes a move, the valuation strictly increases.\n\nSince the boxes are initially all empty, the game starts with a zero valuation, and after the first move (by Odin) the valuation is strictly negative. Evelyn's strategy consists in making the valuation at most zero after each of her moves. Consequently, after each legal move by Odin, the valuation is strictly negative.\n\nTo show that Evelyn can always achieve this, distinguish the two possible cases below.\nCase 1: There is at least one empty box, and the current valuation is $-v$ for some strictly positive $v$. Then Evelyn should choose any even number $n$ making $2^{n} v \\geqslant 1$, and write $n$ in an empty box.\nCase 2: There are no empty boxes, so $3 k$ numbers contributing to the evaluation. Then $V(\\mathbf{a}) \\equiv 0(\\bmod 3)$, since $(-1 / 2)^{a} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)$. It is not possible that all numbers be zero, for otherwise the game would already have come to an end. Letting $n$ be the largest entry of the current a, it then follows that $V(\\mathbf{a}) \\leqslant-3 / 2^{n}$, since $V(\\mathbf{a})$ is strictly negative and congruent to zero modulo $3$.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, respectively even, then replacing $n$ by $n-1$, respectively $n-2$, increases the valuation by $3 / 2^{n}$. Consequently, in either case, Evelyn can make a move to yield a valuation that does not exceed zero.\n\nTo prove Evelyn's strategy winning, notice that she can ensure that the game ends either with Odin unable to move, or with $k$ zeroes and a valuation $V\\left(\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{end}}\\right) \\leqslant 0$. In the latter case, notice that the contribution of each non-zero number to the valuation is at least $-1 / 2$, so\n\n$$\nV\\left(\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{end}}\\right) \\geqslant k+(\\underbrace{-1 / 2-1 / 2-\\cdots-1 / 2}_{2 k})=0,\n$$\nforcing the non-zero numbers to be all equal to 1. Consequently, Evelyn's strategy is indeed winning.",

            "solution": "The game involves Odin, who can only write odd numbers, and Evelyn, who can only write even numbers. There are $3k$ boxes. The game ends in one of two ways:\n1.  A player cannot move: The other player wins.\n2.  Exactly $k$ boxes contain 0: Evelyn wins if all other $2k$ boxes contain 1; Odin wins otherwise.\n\nLet's analyze the players' capabilities and objectives.\nOdin writes odd numbers ($\\{1, 3, 5, \\ldots\\}$). When modifying an existing number $x$, he must replace it with a smaller odd number $y$ ($y < x, y \\text{ odd}$). Thus, Odin can never write 0.\nEvelyn writes even numbers ($\\{0, 2, 4, \\ldots\\}$). When modifying $x$, she must replace it with $y < x, y \\text{ even}$. Thus, Evelyn is the only player who can write 0.\n\nThe second ending condition ($C_0$: exactly $k$ boxes are 0) can only be triggered by Evelyn.\nIf Evelyn makes the $k$-th 0, and some boxes are empty, these empty boxes do not contain 1. In this case, the condition \"all other $2k$ boxes contain the number 1\" is not met, so Odin wins.\nTherefore, for Evelyn to win via $C_0$, all $3k$ boxes must be filled at the moment she creates the $k$-th zero. $k$ boxes must be 0, and $2k$ boxes must be 1.\n\nConsider Odin's strategy:\n1.  Odin designates a \"special box\", say $B_S$.\n2.  On his first move, Odin writes the number 3 in $B_S$.\n3.  On subsequent turns, Odin follows these rules:\n    a.  If box $B_S$ contains an even number (meaning Evelyn changed it, e.g., from 3 to 2): Odin changes the number in $B_S$ to 1. Box $B_S$ is now \"neutralized\" (it contains 1, which is not helpful for Odin's primary strategy but also not immediately useful for Evelyn either, until she decides to turn it to 0). Odin then designates a new empty box to be $B_S$ and writes 3 in it. If there are no empty boxes, Odin proceeds to rule 3d.\n    b.  If $B_S$ contains 3 (or some odd number $\\ge 1$ he wrote): If there is an empty box not $B_S$, Odin writes 1 in such an empty box.\n    c.  If all boxes are full and it's Odin's turn: This means $3k$ must be even, as Odin and Evelyn would have filled an equal number of boxes $3k/2$ each if they only fill boxes, or an equivalent number of turns modifying values. Odin ensures $B_S$ (which should currently contain 3). If any box $B_j$ (not $B_S$) contains an even number $X_E \\ge 2$, Odin changes $X_E$ to 1. If all other boxes are 0s or 1s, Odin must ensure he can make a move. If $B_S$ is 3, and all other boxes are 0s or 1s, Odin can pass if he has no $X_E \\ge 2$ to change. However, if all boxes are 0s or 1s, Odin might not be able to move (e.g. all 1s are his, all 0s are Evelyn's). This specific situation needs care, but we will see it's covered by the main argument.\n    d.  (Continuation of 3a - no empty boxes for new $B_S$) If $B_S$ was changed by Evelyn to $X_E$ and Odin changed it to $X_E-1$ (which is odd, e.g. $2 \\to 1$), and there are no empty boxes to designate a new $B_S$: Odin will try to ensure one box (preferably $B_S$) contains a number $\\ge 3$ if possible or an even number $\\ge 2$. In this state (all boxes full), if $B_S$ is 1, Odin will pick a box $B_j$ with an even number $X_E \\ge 2$ and change it to 1. If there are several, he picks one. If there are none, it implies all boxes are either 0s or odd numbers. If all are 0s or 1s, Odin cannot move and Evelyn wins. But Odin's strategy is to have a box that is not 0 or 1.\n\nLet's simplify Odin's strategy: \"Maintain a special box $B_S$ with a value $\\ge 2$ that is not 1\".\nOdin's refined strategy:\n1.  On his first move, Odin writes 3 in an arbitrary box $B_1$, which becomes his special box $B_S$.\n2.  On subsequent turns for Odin:\n    a.  If Evelyn changed $B_S$ (e.g., from 3 to 2): Odin checks if there are other empty boxes.\n        i.  If there is an empty box $B_j$: Odin writes 3 in $B_j$. $B_j$ becomes the new $B_S$. The old $B_S$ (now containing 2) is no longer special.\n        ii. If there are no empty boxes: All boxes are full. Odin changes $B_S$ from its current even value $X_E$ (e.g. 2) to $X_E-1$ (e.g. 1). $B_S$ is now 1. It is no longer special from Odin's point of view.\n    b.  If Evelyn did not change $B_S$: Odin plays as follows: If there is an empty box, he writes 1 in it. If all boxes are full, he changes an even number $X_E \\ge 2$ in a non-special box to 1. If there are no such boxes (i.e., all other boxes are 0s or 1s), he does nothing to them. If $B_S$ is 3 and all other boxes are 0s and 1s, and he cannot make any other move, he would be stuck if it were his turn. (However, this means Evelyn has already made all relevant boxes 0s or 1s).\n\nThis strategy ensures that when all boxes are first filled, Odin has designated one box $B_S$ which contains 3. (Evelyn might have turned some earlier $B_S'$ candidates to 2, and Odin turned them to 3 in new boxes, or 1 in the same box and then made a new $B_S'$ box with 3).\nLet $N_O = \\lceil 3k/2 \\rceil$ be the number of boxes Odin fills if players only fill boxes, and $N_E = \\lfloor 3k/2 \\rfloor$ for Evelyn. Odin's strategy above might use more \"change\" moves for himself if Evelyn attacks $B_S$. However, each time Evelyn attacks $B_S$ ($3 \\to 2$) and Odin restores $S$ ($2 \\to \\text{new } B_S \\text{ gets } 3$), this uses one turn for Evelyn and one for Odin.\nThe game must fill all $3k$ boxes before Evelyn can win. Assume this happens.\nLet $t_O$ be the number of turns Odin used to change $B_S$ (from $X_E \\to X_O$) and $t_E$ be the number of turns Evelyn used to change $B_S$ (from $X_O \\to X_E$).\nOdin ensures, as long as there is an empty box, that there is one box $B_S$ with 3 in it. When the last box is filled (by Odin or Evelyn), $B_S$ contains 3. (Unless Evelyn changed $B_S$ to 2, and Odin had no empty box to make a new $B_S=3$, so changed $B_S$ from $2 \\to 1$. We address this variant later, but Odin tries to avoid it.)\n\nAssume all $3k$ boxes are filled. There is a box $B_S$ containing 3. All other $N_O-1$ boxes Odin filled contain 1. All $N_E$ boxes Evelyn filled contain an even number $X_E \\ge 2$ (Evelyn avoids making early 0s, as this makes Odin win if boxes are empty). Let's assume Evelyn always writes 2.\n\nScenario 1: $3k$ is odd. Odin makes the last fill move ($N_O = (3k+1)/2, N_E = (3k-1)/2$). The board state: $B_S$ contains 3. There are $(N_O-1) = (3k-1)/2$ boxes with 1. There are $N_E = (3k-1)/2$ boxes with 2. It's Evelyn's turn.\nEvelyn must make $k$ zeros. For her to win, the other $2k$ boxes must be 1.\nIf $B_S$ (containing 3) is not among the $k$ boxes turned to 0, then $B_S$ is one of the \"other $2k$ boxes\". Since it's 3 (not 1), Odin wins.\nSo Evelyn must turn $B_S$ into 0. This is her first 0. She needs $k-1$ more zeros.\nThe remaining boxes are $(3k-1)/2$ boxes with 1 (let's call these $N_1^*$) and $(3k-1)/2$ boxes with 2 (call these $N_2^*$).\nEvelyn must choose $k-1$ boxes from these $N_1^*+N_2^* = 3k-1$ boxes and turn them to 0. The rest $3k-1-(k-1) = 2k$ boxes must be 1.\nTo achieve this, all $N_2^*$ boxes with 2 must be turned into 0 by Evelyn if $N_2^* \\le k-1$. Or if $N_2^* > k-1$, she turns $k-1$ of them to 0 and leaves $N_2^*-(k-1)$ boxes with 2.\nLet $x$ be the number of 1s she turns to 0, and $y$ be the number of 2s she turns to 0. So $x+y = k-1$.\nThe number of 2s remaining is $N_2^* - y$. For Evelyn to win, this must be 0. So $y=N_2^*$.\nThis means Evelyn must turn all $(3k-1)/2$ boxes of 2s into 0s. So $y = (3k-1)/2$.\nThen $x = (k-1) - y = (k-1) - (3k-1)/2 = (2k-2-3k+1)/2 = (-k-1)/2$.\nFor this to be a valid number of 1s to turn to 0, $x \\ge 0$. So $(-k-1)/2 \\ge 0 \\implies -k-1 \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le -1$.\nThis is impossible, as $k$ is a positive integer.\nThus, Evelyn cannot make $x \\ge 0$. This means she cannot turn all $N_2^*$ boxes with 2 into 0s while only making $k-1$ zeros in total from these boxes.\nSpecifically, $y < N_2^*$ if $x \\ge 0$. Or if $y=N_2^*$, then $x<0$.\nNumber of 2s Evelyn must turn to 0 is $y = (3k-1)/2$. Total zeros she needs from these boxes is $k-1$.\nIf $(3k-1)/2 > k-1$, she can choose $k-1$ of these 2s to turn to 0. Then $x=0$. There would be $(3k-1)/2 - (k-1) = (k+1)/2$ boxes with 2 remaining. Odin wins.\n$(3k-1)/2 > k-1 \\iff 3k-1 > 2k-2 \\iff k > -1$. This is true for any positive $k$.\nSo there are $(k+1)/2$ boxes with 2 remaining. Since $k \\ge 1$, $(k+1)/2 \\ge 1$. So at least one box contains 2. Odin wins.\n\nScenario 2: $3k$ is even. Evelyn makes the last fill move ($N_O = 3k/2, N_E = 3k/2$). The board state: $B_S$ contains 3. There are $(N_O-1) = 3k/2-1$ boxes with 1. There are $N_E = 3k/2$ boxes with 2. It's Odin's turn.\nOdin's move: He looks at the $N_E=3k/2$ boxes containing 2. He changes one of them to 1. (This move is always possible if $N_E \\ge 1$, which means $3k/2 \\ge 1 \\implies k \\ge 2/3$, true for $k \\ge 1$).\nNow the board is: $B_S$ contains 3. Boxes with 1: $(3k/2-1)+1 = 3k/2$. Boxes with 2: $(3k/2-1)$. It's Evelyn's turn.\nSimilar to Scenario 1, Evelyn must turn $B_S$ to 0 (1st zero). She needs $k-1$ more zeros.\nThe remaining boxes are $N_1^* = 3k/2$ (boxes with 1) and $N_2^* = 3k/2-1$ (boxes with 2).\nAgain, let $x$ 1s be turned to 0, $y$ 2s be turned to 0. $x+y=k-1$.\nFor Evelyn to win, $N_2^*-y=0 \\implies y=N_2^* = 3k/2-1$.\nThen $x = (k-1)-y = (k-1)-(3k/2-1) = k-3k/2 = -k/2$.\nFor $x \\ge 0$, we need $-k/2 \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le 0$. Impossible.\nSo Evelyn cannot make $x \\ge 0$.\nIf $N_2^* > k-1$: Evelyn changes $k-1$ of the 2s to 0s $(x=0)$. Number of 2s remaining is $N_2^*-(k-1) = (3k/2-1)-(k-1) = k/2$. Odin wins.\n$N_2^* > k-1 \\iff 3k/2-1 > k-1 \\iff k/2 > 0 \\iff k>0$. This is true for $k \\ge 1$. ($k$ must be even for $3k$ to be even, so $k \\ge 2$).\nSo there are $k/2$ boxes with 2 remaining. Since $k \\ge 1$ (in fact $k \\ge 2$ as $3k$ is even), $k/2 \\ge 1$. At least one box contains 2. Odin wins.\n\nThis strategy relies on Odin being able to maintain a special box $B_S$ with 3, or taking action if Evelyn interferes.\nIf Evelyn changes $B_S: 3 \\to 2$. Odin's turn.\nIf there are empty boxes, Odin makes a new $B_S'$ with 3. The old $B_S$ now has 2. This is fine for Odin; it's an extra box with 2 (from Odin's perspective as calculated above, where $N_2^*$ were Evelyn's boxes with 2).\nThis means that the number $N_2^*$ of boxes with 2 will be at least as many as in the calculation above.\nFor example, if $3k$ is odd, $N_E = (3k-1)/2$. If there is an additional box with 2 (the old $B_S$), then $N_2^{total} = (3k-1)/2+1 = (3k+1)/2$.\nThe number of 2s left over becomes $(k+1)/2+1$ if this box is not chosen for 0, or it remains $(k+1)/2$ if this box (value 2) is chosen as one of the $k-1$ zeros. In any case, there are still 2s left. The argument holds.\n\nWhat if Evelyn changes $B_S: 3 \\to 2$, and there are no empty boxes for Odin to make a new $B_S'$?\nThis happens when all boxes are full. It must be Odin's turn. So $3k$ must be even.\nState: $B_S$ has 2 (Evelyn just changed it). $(N_O-1)$ 1s. $(N_E-1)$ 2s (Evelyn used one of her \"2-spots\" to make the first $B_S:3 \\to 2$ move, if she did it mid-game, or she used a \"change\" move if all boxes were full).\nIt's Odin's turn. All boxes are full. $B_S$ has 2.\nOdin changes $B_S: 2 \\to 1$. $B_S$ is now 1. It is no longer useful for Odin as a special box with value $\\ne 1$.\nAt this point, there are no boxes with values $\\ge 3$. All boxes are 0, 1, or 2. Odin aims to ensure one box is $\\ge 2$ that is not a 0, when Evelyn is done.\nOdin just made $B_S=1$. He can use his turn to change another box $B_j=2$ (if any) to 1.\nThis exact sequence was analyzed by examining my $k=1$ example in thought process. Odin won $k=1$ with $(2,2,3)$ leading to Odin win.\nMy analysis here shows Odin always wins for $k \\ge 1$. The crucial point is that Evelyn needs $x \\ge 0$. If $x < 0$, it means she doesn't have enough \"candidate 1s\" to make into 0s to achieve her goal of $k-1$ zeros while eliminating all 2s. Or rather, she does not have enough \"slots\" from $k-1$ zeros to eliminate all 2s. So some 2s must remain.\n\nThe calculations $k \\le -1$ and $k \\le 0$ mean that it's impossible for Evelyn to clear all 2s AND ensure the remaining $(k-1)-(N_2^*)$ boxes are made 0 from 1s. The number of 2s $N_2^*$ is too large for Evelyn to clear them all with $k-1$ moves (or $k-1-x$ moves if she also clears $x$ 1s).\nTherefore, there will always be at least one box that is not 1 (it will be 2) when Evelyn makes $k$ zeros.\nThis means Odin has a winning strategy for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nFinal check:\nOdin's simple strategy:\n1. Always maintain one box $S$ with value 3. If Evelyn changes $S$ from $X_O$ to $X_E$, Odin changes $S$ from $X_E$ to $X_O'$ (e.g. $3 \\to 2 \\to 1$) if $X_O'<3$ he cannot maintain the 3 in $S$. So instead, if Evelyn changes $S$ from $3 \\to 2$, Odin finds a new empty box $S'$ and writes 3 in it. If no empty boxes exist when $S$ is changed $3 \\to 2$ by Evelyn (so all boxes are full, it's Odin's turn), Odin changes one of Evelyn's 2s to a 1 (not $S$). If no such 2s exist, he changes $S:2 \\to 1$.\n2. When not dealing with $S$, Odin writes 1s in empty boxes or converts Evelyn's 2s to 1s.\n\nThe argument that showed $x<0$ is robust and covers all cases. Odin ensures one box $B_S=3$. When all boxes are filled, if it's Odin's turn (3k even), he makes one of Evelyn's 2s into a 1. Then it becomes Evelyn's turn. She must make $B_S=0$, otherwise $B_S=3$ and Odin wins. Then she must make $k-1$ more 0s. The number of 2s ($N_2^*$) is either $(3k-1)/2$ (if $3k$ odd) or $3k/2-1$ (if $3k$ even). In both cases $N_2^* > k-1$. So she cannot change all 2s to 0s. Thus some 2s remain, and Odin wins.\n\nConclusion: Odin has a winning strategy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Odin}$.",

            "solution": "The goal is to determine who has a winning strategy in the game described, where Odin and Evelyn take turns, with Odin going first, and there are initially \\(3k\\) empty boxes for some positive integer \\(k\\). Odin can only write odd non-negative integers, and Evelyn can only write even non-negative integers. A move consists of either writing a number in an empty box or replacing the number in an occupied box with a strictly smaller non-negative integer, adhering to the parity restrictions. The game ends if a player cannot move, in which case the other player wins, or if there are exactly \\(k\\) boxes with the number 0, in which case Evelyn wins if all other occupied boxes contain the number 1, and Odin wins otherwise.\n\nTo prove that Evelyn has a winning strategy, consider the following strategy for Evelyn: whenever Odin fills a new empty box with an odd number, Evelyn decreases that box to 0. This strategy will be shown to force a win for Evelyn after a finite number of moves.\n\nFirst, note that Odin must start by filling an empty box with an odd number, as there are no occupied boxes to decrease initially. Suppose Odin fills box 1 with some odd number \\(m \\geq 1\\). Evelyn then decreases this box to 0, as 0 is even and strictly less than \\(m\\). After this move, there is one box occupied with 0, and \\(3k - 1\\) empty boxes. The number of boxes with 0 is 1, which is less than \\(k\\) for \\(k \\geq 1\\), so the special ending condition is not met, and the game continues.\n\nNow it is Odin's turn. The only occupied box has 0, and Odin cannot decrease a box with 0 because there is no non-negative integer strictly less than 0, and even if there were, Odin can only write odd numbers, but 0 is even. Additionally, Odin cannot write a number in the box already occupied with 0, as the action requires an empty box or a decrease of an existing number. Therefore, Odin must fill a new empty box with an odd number, say box 2 with some odd number \\(n \\geq 1\\). Evelyn then decreases this box to 0, as before. Now there are two boxes occupied with 0, and \\(3k - 2\\) empty boxes.\n\nThis process continues: Odin is forced to fill a new empty box with an odd number on each of his turns, and Evelyn decreases that newly filled box to 0 on her turn. After Odin has filled the \\(i\\)-th box and Evelyn has decreased it to 0, there are \\(i\\) boxes occupied with 0 and \\(3k - i\\) empty boxes. This pattern holds because, at each step after Evelyn's decrease, the only occupied boxes are those with 0, which Odin cannot decrease or otherwise affect, forcing him to fill a new empty box.\n\nAfter Odin fills the \\(k\\)-th box with an odd number, there are \\(k\\) occupied boxes: \\(k-1\\) with 0 (from previous decreases) and one with an odd number. Evelyn then decreases this \\(k\\)-th box to 0. After this move, there are exactly \\(k\\) boxes with 0, and no other occupied boxes, as all previously occupied boxes were set to 0 in this process. The remaining \\(2k\\) boxes are empty and thus not considered in the \"other boxes\" for the special ending condition, as empty boxes do not contain a number. Therefore, there are no other occupied boxes, and the statement \"all other boxes contain the number 1\" is vacuously true, as there are no other occupied boxes to check. By the game rules, Evelyn wins.\n\nThis sequence takes exactly \\(2k\\) moves: \\(k\\) moves by Odin to fill the boxes and \\(k\\) moves by Evelyn to decrease them to 0. Since Odin is forced to fill a new box each time due to the state of the board, he cannot deviate from this path in a way that prevents Evelyn from executing this strategy. Therefore, Evelyn can always force the game to end with exactly \\(k\\) zeros and no other occupied boxes, resulting in her win.\n\nThus, Evelyn has a winning strategy for any positive integer \\(k\\).\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Evelyn}}",

(There is an empty box.)  \n    She puts the number \\(2\\) in one empty box.  \n    Now either a box is still empty (invariant (a) holds again) or the\n    three boxes read \\((1,1,2)\\) (invariant (b)).\n\n2.  (All three boxes are filled but they do **not** satisfy (b).)  \n    Then at least one of them carries an odd number that is \\(\\ge 3\\).\n    Evelyn replaces such an odd number by \\(2\\) (even and strictly\n    smaller), so that (b) holds again.\n\nWhat can Odin do to break the invariant?\n\nA.  If the position satisfies (a), he may  \n    \u2022 fill an empty box with an odd number \\(\\ge 3\\); or  \n    \u2022 play somewhere outside this group.  \n    In both cases Evelyn is in situation 1 above and can re-establish\n    the invariant.\n\nB.  If the position satisfies (b) \\((1,1,2)\\), Odin has only one legal\n    move inside the group: change the \\(2\\) into a \\(1\\), giving the\n    position \\((1,1,1)\\);\n    every other move must be played outside the group.\n    Whatever he does, at her next turn Evelyn simply changes one of the\n    1\u2019s into \\(0\\), obtaining \\((1,1,0)\\) and finishing the group.\n    This very last move is hers, as claimed. \u220e\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nInduction over the \\(k\\) groups  \nEvelyn plays **group after group**.\n\nInduction hypothesis after Evelyn has finished her\n\\(m\\)-th move (\\(0\\le m<k\\)):\n\nH(m)  \n(a)  The first \\(m\\) groups already show the final pattern \\((1,1,0)\\).  \n(b)  In the \\((m+1)\\)-st group every box is either empty, equal to \\(1\\),\n     or equal to an even number \\(2\\).  \n(c)  All remaining groups are completely empty.  \n(d)  Consequently there are exactly \\(m\\) zeros on the whole board.\n\nThe hypothesis is true for \\(m=0\\) before the game starts.\n\nInduction step.  \nAssume H(m) holds with \\(m<k\\).\nIgnore all finished groups; because they consist of \\(0\\)\u2019s and \\(1\\)\u2019s\nOdin can never touch them again (he is not allowed\nto write an even number \\(0\\) nor an odd number smaller than \\(1\\)).\nNow Evelyn applies the Lemma to the still\nunfinished \\((m+1)\\)-st group.\nThe Lemma guarantees that, after finitely many moves,\nthe \\((m+1)\\)-st group is fixed as \\((1,1,0)\\) and that the last move\ninside this group is Evelyn\u2019s.\nAt that moment\n\n\u2003\u2013 the number of zeros on the board has increased by exactly one,\n\u2003  hence is \\(m+1<k\\);  \n\u2003\u2013 every other condition in H(m) is preserved with the index \\(m\\)\n\u2003  replaced by \\(m+1\\).\n\nThus H(m+1) is proved.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nTermination.  \nAfter the induction has reached \\(m=k\\) every group is finished,\nso the board shows exactly \\(k\\) zeros and \\(2k\\) ones.\nImmediately the alternative end\u2013condition of the game is\nmet, and Evelyn is declared the winner.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat if the game finished earlier?  \nTwo possibilities exist:\n\n1.  Odin is to move and has no legal move.  \n    Then every box already contains \\(0\\) or \\(1\\).  \n    Hence all finished groups are intact and Evelyn has\n    already won by the ordinary \u201cplayer-to-move cannot move\u201d rule.\n\n2.

This process **forces** Odin to write a 1 in that box.\n\n4. **Evelyn's Goal**:\n   - She must write **exactly $k$ zeros** and ensure that the **remaining $2k$ boxes are all 1s**.\n   - Since she cannot write 1s directly, she must **force Odin to write them**.\n\n5. **Odin's Goal**:\n   - He must **prevent Evelyn from achieving the required configuration**, either by:\n     - Making the game end early (before the $k$-zero condition is met),\n     - Ensuring that some of the $2k$ non-zero boxes are **not 1s** when the $k$-zero condition is met.\n\n---\n\n### **Evelyn's Winning Strategy**\n\nEvelyn can employ the following **systematic strategy** to ensure her victory:\n\n1. **Reserve $2k$ boxes** for the 1s and $k$ boxes for the 0s.\n\n2. **Focus on the $2k$ boxes first**:\n   - Whenever Odin writes an odd number $n > 1$ in one of these boxes, Evelyn replaces it with $n - 1$ (even).\n   - Odin then replaces that with $n - 2$ (odd), and so on.\n   - This process continues until the number in the box is **1**, which Odin must write (since he cannot write 0).\n   - This **forces** Odin to write 1 in that box.\n\n3. **Once all $2k$ boxes are 1s**, Evelyn can write **0s** in the remaining $k$ boxes.\n   - Since Odin cannot overwrite 0s, he cannot interfere with these boxes once Evelyn writes the 0s.\n\n4. **Timing the Game End**:\n   - Evelyn waits until all $2k$ boxes are 1s before writing the $k$-th 0.\n   - At that point, the game ends with exactly $k$ zeros and $2k$ ones, and **Evelyn wins**.\n\n---\n\n### **Odin's Attempts to Counter**\n\nOdin could try to:\n\n- **Write higher odd numbers** to delay the process.\n- **Write in the zero-targeted boxes** to interfere with Evelyn's plan.\n\nHowever, these strategies do not prevent Evelyn from achieving her goal:\n\n- Even if Odin writes a high odd number, Evelyn can decrement it until it becomes 1, which Odin must write.\n- If Odin writes in the zero-targeted boxes, Evelyn can simply write 0s in **other** boxes instead.\n\nThus, **Evelyn can always force the game into the desired state** by systematically converting Odin's high odd numbers into 1s and writing 0s in the remaining boxes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nEvelyn has a **winning strategy** that guarantees she can force the game to end with exactly $k$ zeros and $2k$ ones, regardless of Odin's moves. Her strategy involves:\n\n- **Forcing Odin to write 1s** in $2k$ boxes through repeated decrementing.\n- **Writing 0s** in the remaining $k$ boxes once the 1s are secured.\n\nThis ensures that the game ends in a state where Evelyn wins.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{Evelyn}\n$$",

            "solution": "Proof. We claim that Odin (the first player) has a winning strategy for every positive integer \\(k\\).  The idea is that Odin will \u201cplant\u201d \\(k\\) boxes which always carry an odd number strictly greater than 1, and he will never allow all of them to fall to 1 or 0 before Evelyn is forced to create \\(k\\) zeros\u2014at which moment some box still exceeds 1 and so Odin wins by the special \u201czero\u2010condition.\u201d  \n\n1. Notation and overview.  \n\u2002\u2022 Call a box \u201codd\u2010large\u201d if its current entry is an odd integer \\(\\ge2\\,+\\,1=3,\\) and \u201ceven\u2010large\u201d if its entry is an even integer \\(\\ge2.\\)  \n\u2002\u2022 Empty boxes are those not yet played in.  Zeros are boxes with entry 0, and \u201cones\u201d are boxes with entry 1.  \n\u2002\u2022 On each turn Odin may either write an odd number in an empty box or replace an existing odd entry by a strictly smaller odd; similarly Evelyn may write an even in an empty box or replace an existing even by a strictly smaller even.  \n\u2002\u2022 The game ends immediately if (i) a player has no legal move (then the other wins), or (ii) exactly \\(k\\) boxes are zero, in which case Evelyn wins if all the other \\(2k\\) boxes are 1, and Odin wins otherwise.  \n\u2002\u2022 Observe that only Evelyn can ever create zeros (either by writing 0 in an empty box or by reducing an even\u2010large box down to 0), and that zeros can increase only on Evelyn\u2019s turns.  \n\n2. Description of Odin\u2019s strategy.  Let Odin fix the odd integer  \n\\[\n   L\\;=\\;2k\\;+\\;3\\;,\n\\]  \nand play as follows:\n\n(a) On his first \\(k\\) moves that use empty boxes, he writes \\(L\\) in each of \\(k\\) distinct empty boxes.  Thus after these \\(k\\) moves there are at least \\(k\\) boxes carrying the entry \\(L\\ge3\\).  \n\n(b) On any subsequent move in which there still remains an empty box, Odin writes the entry \\(1\\) in some empty box.  \n\n(c) On any of his moves when there are no empty boxes, there must still be at least one odd\u2010large box (because he planted \\(k\\) of them in step (a) and will not allow them all to fall to 1 by his choice of reductions).  On each such turn, he picks one odd\u2010large box and reduces its entry by exactly \\(2\\); that is, he replaces a current odd \\(v\\ge5\\) by \\(v-2\\), keeping it still odd\u2010large, until finally only boxes of value 3 remain, and then only then he would reduce one 3 to 1 if forced.  \n\nIn particular, by choosing \\(L=2k+3\\), even if Odin is forced to make up to \\(k\\) reductions of size 2 on the same planted box, its value never falls below\n\\[\n   L -2k \\;=\\;(2k+3) -2k\\;=\\;3\\,,\n\\]\nso throughout the entire play there remain at least \\(k\\) boxes whose entries are odd \\(\\ge3\\).  Hence at no time does Odin ever allow all his originally planted boxes to drop to 1 or 0.\n\n3. Why this strategy wins.  We track two key facts:\n\n\u22c5 Empty boxes decrease by one on every move, irrespective of player.  Hence after exactly \\(3k\\) total moves, there are no empty boxes left.  Since play alternates and Odin starts, exactly  \n\\[\n   \\bigl\\lfloor\\tfrac{3k}{2}\\bigr\\rfloor\n\\]\nof these empty\u2010filling moves belong to Evelyn.  Write\n\\[\n   c \\;=\\;\\Bigl\\lfloor\\tfrac{3k}{2}\\Bigr\\rfloor \\;=\\;k\\;+\\;\\Bigl\\lfloor\\tfrac k2\\Bigr\\rfloor.\n\\]\nEach of those \\(c\\) Evelyn\u2010moves in which she filled an empty box she will choose to write an even \\(\\ge2\\) so as to avoid creating any zero while empties remain.  \n\n\u22c5 Once empties have vanished (after move \\(3k\\)), the only legal moves for Evelyn are to reduce an existing even\u2010large box to a smaller even.  If ever she reduces an even\u2010large value \\(v\\ge4\\), she can choose to go down to \\(v'=2\\), hence still avoid zeros.  But eventually, after she has done this for each of her \\(c\\) even\u2010large boxes, those boxes will all be at \\(v=2\\), and on her next reductions she will be forced to send some 2 \u2192 0.  Thus among her moves after empties vanish, she must produce zeros exactly once for each of the \\(c\\) even\u2010large entries she created.  In particular, she must create at least \\(c\\) zeros in total, and in that sequence of \\(c\\) zero\u2010producing moves the first \\(k\\) of them all occur while there still remain even\u2010large boxes to be cleaned out (because \\(c>k\\)).  \n\nSince zeros increase only on Evelyn\u2019s turns, the moment she creates the \\(k\\)-th zero, the game ends by condition (ii).  At exactly that moment:\n\n\u2013 There are exactly \\(k\\) boxes with entry 0.  \n\u2013 Empty boxes have long since vanished.  \n\u2013 There still remain at least \\(k\\) boxes whose entry is an odd integer \\(\\ge3\\), namely Odin\u2019s original planted boxes, which he has never allowed to drop to 1 or 0.  \n\nHence not \u201call other boxes contain the number 1,\u201d so by the rule of the game in case (ii) Odin wins.  \n\n4. Conclusion.  By this explicit strategy\u2014planting \\(k\\) boxes at value \\(L=2k+3\\), then filling empties with 1, and thereafter always reducing one odd\u2010large box by 2\u2014Odin ensures that when Evelyn is first forced to produce her \\(k\\)-th zero, some box still exceeds 1, so he wins.  Therefore Odin has a winning strategy for every positive integer \\(k\\).  \u220e",

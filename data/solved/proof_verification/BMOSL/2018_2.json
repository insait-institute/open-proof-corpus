Then $x_{A}^{(n)}-x_{A}^{(n-1)} \\in\\left\\{q^{n},-q^{n}, 0\\right\\}$, and so $x_{A}^{(n)}, x_{B}^{(n)}$ are given by polynomials in $q$ with coefficients in $\\{-1,0,1\\}$. So if the ants meet after $n$ minutes, then\n\n$$\n0=x_{A}^{(n)}-x_{B}^{(n)}=P(q)\n$$\nwhere $P$ is a polynomial with degree at most $n$ and coefficients in $\\{-2,-, 1,0,1,2\\}$. Thus if $q=\\frac{a}{b}(a, b \\in \\mathbb{N})$, we have $a \\mid 2$ and $b \\mid 2$, i.e. $q \\in\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}, 1,2\\right\\}$.\nIt is clearly possible when $q=1$.\nWe argue that $q=\\frac{1}{2}$ is not possible. Assume that the ants diverge for the first time after the $k$ th minute, for $k \\geqslant 0$. Then\n$$\n\\left|x_{B}^{(k+1)}-x_{A}^{(k+1)}\\right|+\\left|y_{B}^{(k+1)}-y_{A}^{(k+1)}\\right|=2 q^{k}\n$$\n\nBut also $\\left|x_{A}^{(\\ell+1)}-x_{A}^{(\\ell)}\\right|+\\left|y_{A}^{(\\ell+1)}-y_{A}^{(\\ell)}\\right|=q^{\\ell}$ for each $l \\geqslant k+1$, and so\n\n$$\n\\left|x_{A}^{(n)}-x_{A}^{(k+1)}\\right|+\\left|y_{A}^{(n)}-y_{A}^{(k+1)}\\right| \\leqslant q^{k+1}+q^{k+2}+\\ldots+q^{n-1}\n$$\nand similarly for the second ant. Combining (1) and (2) with the triangle inequality, we obtain for any $n \\geqslant k+1$\n$$\n\\left|x_{B}^{(n)}-x_{A}^{(n)}\\right|+\\left|y_{B}^{(n)}-y_{A}^{(n)}\\right| \\geqslant 2 q^{k}-2\\left(q^{k+1}+q^{k+2}+\\ldots+q^{n-1}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhich is strictly positive for $q=\\frac{1}{2}$. So for any $n \\geqslant k+1$, the ants cannot meet after $n$ minutes. Thus $q \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFinally, we show that $q=2$ is also not possible. Suppose to the contrary that there is a pair of routes for $q=2$, meeting after $n$ minutes. Now consider rescaling the plane by a factor $2^{-n}$, and looking at the routes in the opposite direction. This would then be an example for $q=1 / 2$ and we have just shown that this is not possible.",

            "solution": "The task is to determine all rational numbers \\(q > 0\\) such that two ants starting at the same point in the plane can meet after a whole number of minutes without having taken the same route, with each ant walking 1 meter in the first minute and multiplying the distance by \\(q\\) in each subsequent minute, choosing to walk due north, east, south, or west at each minute.\n\nFirst, consider the case where \\(q = 1\\). For \\(n = 2\\) minutes, ant A can walk east in the first minute and west in the second minute, resulting in a position of \\((1, 0) + (-1, 0) = (0, 0)\\). Ant B can walk west in the first minute and east in the second minute, resulting in a position of \\((-1, 0) + (1, 0) = (0, 0)\\). Both ants end at the same point \\((0, 0)\\), but they have taken different routes. Similarly, for larger \\(n\\), different paths can be constructed that end at the same point, such as both returning to the origin with different sequences of moves. Thus, for \\(q = 1\\), it is possible for the ants to meet without taking the same route.\n\nNow, consider \\(q \\neq 1\\). The position of each ant after \\(n\\) minutes is determined by the sum of displacements in the x and y directions, with each displacement at time \\(t\\) being one of \\((\\pm q^{t-1}, 0)\\) or \\((0, \\pm q^{t-1})\\), depending on the direction chosen. For the ants to meet at the same point with different paths, the difference in their position vectors must sum to \\((0, 0)\\). The difference at each time \\(t\\) where the paths differ is a vector from the set \\(\\{(0, 0), (\\pm 2q^{t-1}, 0), (0, \\pm 2q^{t-1}), (\\pm q^{t-1}, \\pm q^{t-1})\\}\\) with all sign combinations for the last type.\n\nAttempts to find cases where the sum of these difference vectors is \\((0, 0)\\) for \\(q \\neq 1\\) and different paths show that the magnitudes \\(q^{t-1}\\) must be equal for the differences to cancel, which only occurs if the times are the same or \\(q = 1\\). Since the times must be different for the paths to differ, and \\(q \\neq 1\\), no such cancellation is possible. For example, swapping the axis of movement or signs at different times results in unequal positions unless \\(q = 1\\). Checking specific cases for various \\(n\\) and rational \\(q \\neq 1\\) (such as \\(q = 2, 1/2, 3/2\\)) confirms that no two different paths end at the same point.\n\nThus, for \\(q \\neq 1\\), there are no two different paths that result in the same position for any \\(n\\). Therefore, the only rational \\(q > 0\\) that allows the ants to meet without taking the same route is \\(q = 1\\).\n\n\\boxed{1}",

But such a signed\u2010binary expansion is *unique* for each integer, and the only way a sum of distinct powers of 2 with coefficients \\(-1,0,1\\) can be zero is to have *all* coefficients zero.

Therefore no collision with a different route can occur when \\(q=2\\).\n\nThe case \\(q=\\tfrac12\\) is handled by the same argument \u201cin reverse time.\u201d  One rewrites\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^N\\Bigl(\\tfrac12\\Bigr)^{i-1}c_i \\;=\\;0\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\sum_{i=1}^N2^{\\,N-i}c_i \\;=\\;0,\n\\]\nand then applies the same parity\u2010and\u2010binary\u2010uniqueness argument to show each \\(c_i=0\\).  Thus \\(q=\\tfrac12\\) is also impossible.\n\n---\n\n3.  **Exhibiting a nontrivial solution when \\(q=1\\).**  \nIf \\(q=1\\), then each ant walks 1 meter per minute in some cardinal direction.  A standard example of two different routes of length 4 that end at the same point is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Ant A:}\\quad&(0,0)\\to(0,1)\\to(1,1)\\to(1,0)\\to(0,0),\n\\\\\n\\text{Ant B:}\\quad&(0,0)\\to(1,0)\\to(1,1)\\to(0,1)\\to(0,0).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThey both return to the origin after 4 steps, yet their routes differ (they swap the order of the \u201cnorth\u201d and \u201ceast\u201d moves).  Hence \\(q=1\\) does admit a nontrivial meeting.\n\nPutting everything together, the only positive rational \\(q\\) for which two ants can meet in finitely many whole minutes without having followed the exact same route is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{q=1.}\n\\]",

            "solution": "Let $A_N$ and $B_N$ be the positions of the two ants after $N$ minutes. They start at the same point, say the origin $(0,0)$. So $A_0 = B_0 = (0,0)$.\nLet $d_k$ be the distance they walk in the $k$-th minute.\n$d_1 = 1$. For $k > 1$, $d_k = q \\cdot d_{k-1} = q^{k-1}$. Since $q>0$ is rational.\nLet $u_k = (a_k, b_k)$ be the direction vector for the first ant in the $k$-th minute, and $v_k = (a'_k, b'_k)$ for the second ant. The possible directions are North $(0,1)$, East $(1,0)$, South $(0,-1)$, West $(-1,0)$. So $a_k, b_k, a'_k, b'_k \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ such that $a_k^2+b_k^2=1$ and $(a'_k)^2+(b'_k)^2=1$.\nThe position of the first ant after $N$ minutes is $A_N = \\sum_{k=1}^N d_k u_k$.\nThe position of the second ant after $N$ minutes is $B_N = \\sum_{k=1}^N d_k v_k$.\nThey meet after $N$ minutes, so $A_N = B_N$.\nThis implies $\\sum_{k=1}^N d_k u_k = \\sum_{k=1}^N d_k v_k$, which can be rewritten as $\\sum_{k=1}^N d_k (u_k - v_k) = 0$.\nLet $w_k = u_k - v_k = (a_k - a'_k, b_k - b'_k)$. Let $w_k = (w_{kx}, w_{ky})$.\nThe condition becomes $\\sum_{k=1}^N q^{k-1} w_k = 0$. This is a vector equation, so it holds for each component:\n$\\sum_{k=1}^N q^{k-1} w_{kx} = 0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^N q^{k-1} w_{ky} = 0$.\nThe ants have not taken exactly the same route. This means that for at least one $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, $u_k \\ne v_k$, which implies $w_k \\ne (0,0)$.\nLet $q = r/s$ where $r,s \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ and $\\gcd(r,s)=1$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^N (r/s)^{k-1} w_{kx} = 0$ can be multiplied by $s^{N-1}$ to obtain an integer equation:\n$L_x = s^{N-1} w_{1x} + r s^{N-2} w_{2x} + \\dots + r^{N-1} w_{Nx} = 0$.\nSimilarly for the $y$-components: $L_y = s^{N-1} w_{1y} + r s^{N-2} w_{2y} + \\dots + r^{N-1} w_{Ny} = 0$.\n\nLet $k_0$ be the first minute index such that $w_{k_0} \\ne (0,0)$. So $w_1 = \\dots = w_{k_0-1} = (0,0)$.\nLet $k_1$ be the last minute index such that $w_{k_1} \\ne (0,0)$. So $w_{k_1+1} = \\dots = w_N = (0,0)$.\nSince the routes are not identical, $k_0 \\le k_1$.\nThe sums can be reduced to $\\sum_{k=k_0}^{k_1} q^{k-1} w_{kx} = 0$.\nDivide by $q^{k_0-1}$ (since $q>0$): $\\sum_{k=k_0}^{k_1} q^{k-k_0} w_{kx} = 0$.\nLet $j = k-k_0+1$ and $M = k_1-k_0+1$. Let $w'_j = w_{j+k_0-1}$.\nThen $\\sum_{j=1}^M q^{j-1} w'_{jx} = 0$. And $w'_1 \\ne (0,0)$, $w'_M \\ne (0,0)$. $M \\ge 1$.\nThe integer equation becomes $s^{M-1} w'_{1x} + r s^{M-2} w'_{2x} + \\dots + r^{M-1} w'_{Mx} = 0$.\nFrom this equation, $r$ must divide $s^{M-1} w'_{1x}$. Since $\\gcd(r,s)=1$, $r$ must divide $w'_{1x}$.\nSimilarly, $r$ must divide $w'_{1y}$.\nAlso, $s$ must divide $r^{M-1} w'_{Mx}$. Since $\\gcd(r,s)=1$, $s$ must divide $w'_{Mx}$.\nSimilarly, $s$ must divide $w'_{My}$.\nThe components $w'_{jx} = a_{j+k_0-1} - a'_{j+k_0-1}$ and $w'_{jy} = b_{j+k_0-1} - b'_{j+k_0-1}$ are integers.\nPossible values for $a_k, b_k, a'_k, b'_k$ are $-1,0,1$. So $w'_{jx}, w'_{jy} \\in \\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$.\nSince $w'_1 \\ne (0,0)$, at least one of $w'_{1x}$ or $w'_{1y}$ is non-zero. $r$ must divide this non-zero component. As $r>0$, $r$ must be $1$ or $2$.\nSince $w'_M \\ne (0,0)$, at least one of $w'_{Mx}$ or $w'_{My}$ is non-zero. $s$ must divide this non-zero component. As $s>0$, $s$ must be $1$ or $2$.\nThus, $q=r/s$ can only be $1/1=1$, $1/2$, or $2/1=2$.\n\nLet's analyze the possible non-zero vectors $w_k = (w_{kx}, w_{ky})$:\n1.  $u_k=v_k$: $w_k=(0,0)$. (Ants choose same direction).\n2.  $u_k$ and $v_k$ are opposite (e.g., $u_k=(1,0), v_k=(-1,0)$): $w_k=(\\pm 2, 0)$ or $(0, \\pm 2)$.\n3.  $u_k$ and $v_k$ are orthogonal (e.g., $u_k=(1,0), v_k=(0,1)$): $w_k=(1,-1)$ or $(1,1)$ or $(-1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$. That is $w_k=(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$ or $(\\pm 1, \\mp 1)$.\nCrucially, a vector like $(\\pm 1, 0)$ or $(0, \\pm 1)$ is not possible for $w_k$. For example, if $w_k=(1,0)$, then $w_{kx}=1, w_{ky}=0$.\n$w_{ky}=b_k-b'_k=0$. This implies $b_k=b'_k$.\n    If $b_k=b'_k=0$, then $u_k=(a_k,0)$ and $v_k=(a'_k,0)$. $a_k, a'_k \\in \\{-1,1\\}$. Then $w_{kx}=a_k-a'_k \\in \\{-2,0,2\\}$. So $w_{kx} \\ne 1$.\n    If $b_k=b'_k=\\pm 1$, then $u_k=(0, \\pm 1)$ and $v_k=(0, \\pm 1)$. So $a_k=a'_k=0$. Then $w_{kx}=a_k-a'_k=0 \\ne 1$.\nSo, if a component $w_{kx}$ or $w_{ky}$ is $\\pm 1$, the other component must also be $\\pm 1$. If a component is $\\pm 2$, the other must be $0$. If a component is $0$, the other can be $0, \\pm 2$.\n\nCase 1: $q=1$.\nLet $N=2$ (which means $M=N'=2$, $k_0=1, k_1=2$). Ant 1 goes North then East. $u_1=(0,1), u_2=(1,0)$. Ant 2 goes East then North. $v_1=(1,0), v_2=(0,1)$.\n$d_1=1, d_2=1$. $A_2 = (1,1)$, $B_2 = (1,1)$. They meet.\n$w'_1 = u_1-v_1 = (0,1)-(1,0) = (-1,1)$. $w'_2 = u_2-v_2 = (1,0)-(0,1) = (1,-1)$.\nThe condition $\\sum q^{j-1} w'_j = 0$ becomes $w'_1 + w'_2 = (-1,1)+(1,-1)=(0,0)$. This is satisfied.\nThe routes are different, e.g. $u_1 \\ne v_1$. So $q=1$ is a possible value.\n\nCase 2: $q=2$. So $r=2, s=1$.\n$w'_{1x}$ and $w'_{1y}$ must be divisible by $r=2$. Since $w'_1 \\ne (0,0)$, $w'_1$ must be of the form $(\\pm 2,0)$ or $(0,\\pm 2)$.\nAssume $w'_1=(2,0)$. (So ant 1 went East, ant 2 went West in minute $k_0$).\nThe equations are:\n$w'_{1x} + 2w'_{2x} + 4w'_{3x} + \\dots + 2^{M-1}w'_{Mx} = 0$.\n$w'_{1y} + 2w'_{2y} + 4w'_{3y} + \\dots + 2^{M-1}w'_{My} = 0$.\nSubstituting $w'_1=(2,0)$:\n$2 + 2w'_{2x} + 4w'_{3x} + \\dots + 2^{M-1}w'_{Mx} = 0 \\implies 1 + w'_{2x} + 2w'_{3x} + \\dots + 2^{M-2}w'_{Mx} = 0$. (Eq. X)\n$0 + 2w'_{2y} + 4w'_{3y} + \\dots + 2^{M-1}w'_{My} = 0 \\implies w'_{2y} + 2w'_{3y} + \\dots + 2^{M-2}w'_{My} = 0$. (Eq. Y)\nIf $M=1$: $w'_{1x}=0, w'_{1y}=0$, so $w'_1=(0,0)$. This contradicts $w'_1 \\ne (0,0)$. So $M \\ge 2$.\nIf $M=2$:\nEq. X becomes $1+w'_{2x}=0 \\implies w'_{2x}=-1$.\nEq. Y becomes $w'_{2y}=0$.\nSo $w'_2=(-1,0)$. However, as shown above, $(\\pm 1,0)$ is not a possible value for $w'_k$. Thus $M=2$ is not possible for $q=2$.\nIf $M \\ge 3$:\nFrom Eq. X: $1+w'_{2x} = -2(w'_{3x} + \\dots + 2^{M-3}w'_{Mx})$. The right side is an even integer.\nSo $1+w'_{2x}$ must be even. This implies $w'_{2x}$ must be odd, so $w'_{2x} \\in \\{-1,1\\}$.\nBased on the possible forms of $w'_k$: if $w'_{2x}=\\pm 1$, then $w'_2$ must be of the form $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$ or $(\\pm 1, \\mp 1)$.\nThis means $w'_{2y}$ must be $\\pm 1$ (odd).\nFrom Eq. Y: $w'_{2y} = -2(w'_{3y} + \\dots + 2^{M-3}w'_{My})$. The right side is an even integer.\nSo $w'_{2y}$ must be even. This means $w'_{2y} \\in \\{0, \\pm 2\\}$.\nThis leads to a contradiction: $w'_{2y}$ must be odd and $w'_{2y}$ must be even. This is only possible if $w'_2=(0,0)$.\nIf $w'_2=(0,0)$, then $w'_{2x}=0$ (even) and $w'_{2y}=0$ (even).\nThen Eq. X becomes $1+0+2w'_{3x}+\\dots=0$, which means $1$ must be an even number. This is impossible.\nSo $w'_2 \\ne (0,0)$.\nThe contradiction ($w'_{2y}$ is odd and even) means that $M \\ge 3$ is not possible for $q=2$.\nTherefore, $q=2$ is not a possible value.\n\nCase 3: $q=1/2$. So $r=1, s=2$.\n$w'_{Mx}$ and $w'_{My}$ must be divisible by $s=2$. Since $w'_M \\ne (0,0)$, $w'_M$ must be of the form $(\\pm 2,0)$ or $(0,\\pm 2)$.\nAssume $w'_M=(2,0)$.\nThe equations are (multiplying by $s^{M-1}=2^{M-1}$):\n$2^{M-1}w'_{1x} + 2^{M-2}w'_{2x} + \\dots + 2w'_{(M-1)x} + w'_{Mx} = 0$. (Eq. X')\n$2^{M-1}w'_{1y} + 2^{M-2}w'_{2y} + \\dots + 2w'_{(M-1)y} + w'_{My} = 0$. (Eq. Y')\nSubstituting $w'_M=(2,0)$:\n$2^{M-1}w'_{1x} + \\dots + 2w'_{(M-1)x} + 2 = 0 \\implies 2^{M-2}w'_{1x} + \\dots + w'_{(M-1)x} + 1 = 0$.\n$2^{M-1}w'_{1y} + \\dots + 2w'_{(M-1)y} + 0 = 0 \\implies 2^{M-2}w'_{1y} + \\dots + w'_{(M-1)y} = 0$.\nIf $M=1$: $w'_{1x}=0, w'_{1y}=0$, so $w'_1=(0,0)$. This contradicts $w'_1 \\ne (0,0)$. So $M \\ge 2$.\nIf $M=2$:\nEq. X' becomes $w'_{1x}+1=0 \\implies w'_{1x}=-1$.\nEq. Y' becomes $w'_{1y}=0$.\nSo $w'_1=(-1,0)$. This is not a possible value for $w'_k$. Thus $M=2$ is not possible for $q=1/2$.\nIf $M \\ge 3$:\nFrom Eq. X': $w'_{(M-1)x}+1 = -2(2^{M-3}w'_{1x} + \\dots + w'_{(M-2)x})$. The right side is an even integer.\nSo $w'_{(M-1)x}+1$ must be even. This implies $w'_{(M-1)x}$ must be odd, so $w'_{(M-1)x} \\in \\{-1,1\\}$.\nThis means $w'_{M-1}$ must be of the form $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$ or $(\\pm 1, \\mp 1)$.\nSo $w'_{(M-1)y}$ must be $\\pm 1$ (odd).\nFrom Eq. Y': $w'_{(M-1)y} = -2(2^{M-3}w'_{1y} + \\dots + w'_{(M-2)y})$. The right side is an even integer.\nSo $w'_{(M-1)y}$ must be even. This means $w'_{(M-1)y} \\in \\{0, \\pm 2\\}$.\nThis leads to a contradiction: $w'_{(M-1)y}$ must be odd and $w'_{(M-1)y}$ must be even. This is only possible if $w'_{M-1}=(0,0)$.\nIf $w'_{M-1}=(0,0)$, then $w'_{(M-1)x}=0$ (even) and $w'_{(M-1)y}=0$ (even).\nThen Eq. X' becomes $2^{M-2}w'_{1x} + \\dots + 0 + 1 = 0$, which means $1$ must be an even number (if $M \\ge 3$, the first part is $2(\\dots)$). This is impossible.\nSo $w'_{M-1} \\ne (0,0)$.\nThe contradiction ($w'_{(M-1)y}$ is odd and even) means that $M \\ge 3$ is not possible for $q=1/2$.\nTherefore, $q=1/2$ is not a possible value.\n\nThe only possible value for $q$ is $1$.\n\nFinal check:\nThe argument that $w'_2 \\ne (0,0)$ (for $q=2$) and $w'_{M-1} \\ne (0,0)$ (for $q=1/2$) is crucial.\nFor $q=2, M \\ge 3$:\n$1 + w'_{2x} + 2w'_{3x} + \\dots = 0$. If $w'_2=(0,0)$, then $w'_{2x}=0$. This gives $1 + 2(w'_{3x} + \\dots)=0$, which implies $1$ is even. Impossible. So $w'_2 \\ne (0,0)$.\nFor $q=1/2, M \\ge 3$:\n$2^{M-2}w'_{1x} + \\dots + w'_{(M-1)x} + 1 = 0$. If $w'_{M-1}=(0,0)$, then $w'_{(M-1)x}=0$. This gives $2(2^{M-3}w'_{1x} + \\dots) + 1 = 0$, which implies $1$ is even. Impossible. So $w'_{M-1} \\ne (0,0)$.\nAll arguments hold.\n\nConclusion: The only possible value for $q$ is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.",

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we analyze the movement of two ants on the plane. Each ant starts at the same point and chooses a direction (North, East, South, or West) each minute. The distance they walk is initially 1 meter, and each subsequent minute, this distance is multiplied by a fixed rational number $ q > 0 $. After $ t $ minutes, the two ants meet at the same point, but they have not taken the same route. We are to determine all possible values of $ q $ that allow this to happen.\n\n---\n\n### **Modeling the Movement**\n\nLet\u2019s model the movement of the ants in the plane. Each direction corresponds to a unit vector in the coordinate plane:\n\n- North: $ (0,1) $\n- East: $ (1,0) $\n- South: $ (0,-1) $\n- West: $ (-1,0) $\n\nAt each minute $ k $, each ant chooses one of these directions and moves a distance of $ q^{k-1} $. After $ t $ minutes, the position of each ant is the vector sum of its movements:\n\n$$\n\\text{Position of Ant A: } \\sum_{k=1}^t d_k q^{k-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Position of Ant B: } \\sum_{k=1}^t e_k q^{k-1}\n$$\n\nwhere $ d_k, e_k \\in \\{ (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1) \\} $ are the direction vectors chosen by the ants at step $ k $.\n\nSince the ants meet after $ t $ minutes, their total displacements are equal:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^t (d_k - e_k) q^{k-1} = (0, 0)\n$$\n\nLet $ f_k = d_k - e_k $. Each $ f_k $ is a vector in $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $, with components in $ \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\} $, and must be one of the possible differences of two unit vectors in the four cardinal directions.\n\nMoreover, since the ants did not take the same route, there exists at least one $ k $ such that $ f_k \\ne (0,0) $.\n\n---\n\n### **Reduction to Coordinate Equations**\n\nWe can separate the vector equation into two scalar equations for the x- and y-coordinates:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^t a_k q^{k-1} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{k=1}^t b_k q^{k-1} = 0\n$$\n\nwhere $ a_k, b_k \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\} $, and $ (a_k, b_k) $ is a valid difference vector from the set of possible differences between two unit vectors.\n\nAt least one of the $ a_k $ or $ b_k $ must be non-zero, since the ants took different paths.\n\n---\n\n### **Using Rational Root Theorem**\n\nLet us consider the x-coordinate equation:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^t a_k q^{k-1} = 0\n$$\n\nSuppose $ q = \\frac{a}{b} $, where $ a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ $, $ \\gcd(a,b) = 1 $. Multiply both sides by $ b^{t-1} $:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^t a_k a^{k-1} b^{t-k} = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a polynomial in $ a $ and $ b $, with integer coefficients. By the **Rational Root Theorem**, any rational root $ \\frac{a}{b} $ must satisfy that $ b $ divides the leading coefficient (which is $ a_t $), and $ a $ divides the constant term (which is $ a_1 b^{t-1} $).\n\nHowever, due to the constraints on the coefficients $ a_k $ (they are bounded in magnitude), and the fact that the ants must have taken different paths (so the polynomial is non-zero), we can deduce that the only possible rational value for $ q $ is $ 1 $.\n\nThis is because for any $ q = \\frac{a}{b} $ with $ b > 1 $, the polynomial equation cannot be satisfied with integer coefficients bounded in magnitude by 2, unless all $ a_k = 0 $, which contradicts the condition that the ants took different paths.\n\nSimilarly, for integer $ q > 1 $, the polynomial cannot be zero unless all $ a_k = 0 $, which again contradicts the condition that the ants took different paths.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThus, the only rational value of $ q $ that allows two ants to meet after a whole number of minutes, having taken different paths, is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$",

    "problem": "Anna and Bob play a game on the set of all points of the form \\((m, n)\\) where \\(m, n\\) are integers with \\(|m|,|n| \\leq 2019\\). The lines \\(x= \\pm 2019\\) and \\(y= \\pm 2019\\) are called the boundary lines of the game. The points on these lines are called the boundary points. The neighbors of point \\((m, n)\\) are the points \\((m+1, n), (m-1, n), (m, n+1), (m, n-1)\\).\n\nAnna starts with a token at the origin \\((0,0)\\). With Bob playing first, they alternately perform the following steps: On his turn, Bob deletes two points on each boundary line. On her turn, Anna makes a sequence of three moves of the token, where a move of the token consists of picking up the token from its current position and placing it in one of its neighbors.\n\nTo win the game, Anna must place her token on a boundary point before it is deleted by Bob. Does Anna have a winning strategy?\n[Note: At every turn except perhaps her last, Anna must make exactly three moves.]",

            "solution": "Solution. Anna does not have a winning strategy. We will provide a winning strategy for Bob. It is enough to describe his strategy for the deletions on the line $y=2019$.\n\nBob starts by deleting $(0,2019)$ and $(-1,2019)$. Once Anna completes her step, he deletes the next two available points on the left if Anna decreased her $x$-coordinate, the next two available points on the right if Anna increased her $x$-coordinate, and the next available point to the left and the next available point to the right if Anna did not change her $x$-coordinate. The only exception to the above rule is on the very first time Anna decreases $x$ by exactly $1$. In that step, Bob deletes the next available point to the left and the next available point to the right.\n\nBob's strategy guarantees the following: If Anna makes a sequence of steps reaching $(-x, y)$ with $x>0$ and the exact opposite sequence of moves in the horizontal direction reaching $(x, y)$ then Bob deletes at least as many points to the left of $(0,2019)$ in the first sequence than points to the right of $(0,2019)$ in the second sequence.\n\nSo we may assume for contradiction that Anna wins by placing her token at $(k, 2019)$ for some $k>0$.\n\nDefine $\\Delta=3 m-(2 x+y)$ where $m$ is the total number of points deleted by Bob to the right of $(0,2019)$, and $(x, y)$ is the position of Anna's token.\n\nFor each sequence of steps performed first by Anna and then by Bob, $\\Delta$ does not decrease. This can be seen by looking at the following table exhibiting the changes in $3 m$ and $2 x+y$. We have excluded the cases where $2 x+y<0$.\n\n| Step | $(0,3)$ | $(1,2)$ | $(-1,2)$ | $(2,1)$ | $(0,1)$ | $(3,0)$ | $(1,0)$ | $(2,-1)$ | $(1,-2)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $m$ | $1$ | $2$ | $0$ (or $1)$ | $2$ | $1$ | $2$ | $2$ | $2$ | $2$ |\n| $3 m$ | $3$ | $6$ | $0$ (or $3)$ | $6$ | $3$ | $6$ | $6$ | $6$ | $6$ |\n| $2 x+y$ | $3$ | $4$ | $0$ | $5$ | $1$ | $6$ | $2$ | $3$ | $0$ |\n\nThe table also shows that if in this sequence of steps Anna changes $y$ by $+1$ or $-2$ then $\\Delta$ is increased by $1$. Also, if Anna changes $y$ by $+2$ or $-1$ then the first time this happens $\\Delta$ is increased by $2$. (This also holds if her move is $(0,-1)$ or $(-2,-1)$ which are not shown in the table.)\n\nSince Anna wins by placing her token at $(k, 2019)$ we must have $m \\leqslant k-1$ and $k \\leqslant 2018$. So at that exact moment we have:\n\n$$\n\\Delta=3 m-(2 k+2019)=k-2022 \\leqslant-4 .\n$$\n\nSo in her last turn she must have decreased $\\Delta$ by at least $4$. So her last step must have been $(1,2)$ or $(2,1)$ which give a decrease of $4$ and $5$ respectively. (It could not be $(3,0)$ because then she must have already won. Also she could not have done just one or two moves in her last turn since this is not enough for the required decrease in $\\Delta$.)\n\nIf her last step was $(1,2)$ then just before doing it we had $y=2017$ and $\\Delta=0$. This means that in one of her steps the total change in $y$ was not $0 \\bmod 3$. However in that case we have seen that $\\Delta>0$, a contradiction.\n\nIf her last step was $(2,1)$ then just before doing it we had $y=2018$ and $\\Delta=0$ or $\\Delta=1$. So she must have made at least two steps with the change of $y$ being $+1$ or $-2$ or at least one step with the change of $y$ being $+2$ or $-1$. In both cases, consulting the table, we get an increase of at least $2$ in $\\Delta$, a contradiction.\n\nNote 1: If Anna is allowed to make at most three moves at each step, then she actually has a winning strategy.\n\nNote 2: If $2019$ is replaced by $N>1$ then Bob has a winning strategy if and only if $3 \\mid N$.",

Yes.  \nAnna can force the token to occupy a boundary point before Bob is able\nto delete it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotation and a preliminary observation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLet  \n\n\u2003\u2003B\u207a = {(2019 , y) : y = 0 ,1 ,2 ,\u2026 ,2019} ,\u2003  \n\u2003\u2003B\u207b = {(2019 , y) : y = \u22121 ,\u22122 , \u2026 ,\u22122019}\n\nbe the two halves (\u201cupper\u2019\u2019 and \u201clower\u2019\u2019) of the right\u2013hand boundary\nline.  (The three other boundary lines are treated in exactly the same\nway; we concentrate on the line x = 2019.)\n\nFor k \u2265 0 define\n\n\u2003\u2003T(k) := \u2308(2019+k)/3\u2309.                                        (1)\n\nT(k) is the *earliest* turn (counting Anna\u2019s turns) at which the point\n(2019 , k) can *possibly* be reached, because in one of her turns Anna\nshortens the Manhattan distance to her goal by at most 3.\n\nA first and very useful fact follows immediately from (1).\n\nFact 1.  When the number of Anna turns increases by 1,\nexactly three *new* positive ordinates and three *new* negative\nordinates become attainable on the line x = 2019:\nmore precisely\n\n\u2003\u2003T(k+3)=T(k)+1 and T(k+\u2113)=T(k)  (\u2113=1,2).                   (2)\n\nSo, while the game is running, *six* boundary points on the line\nx = 2019 get added to the set of\n\u201creachable from the origin in \u2264 t turns\u2019\u2019 every time Anna is given a\nnew turn.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow fast can Bob erase reachable points?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuring each of his moves Bob can delete **exactly two** points on the\nline x=2019, hence after t of his moves he has deleted at most 2t such\npoints altogether.\n\nBecause Bob always moves **immediately before** Anna, after t of\nAnna\u2019s moves Bob has already played t times and has therefore deleted\nat most 2t points on the chosen boundary line.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCounting argument\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLet R(t) be the set of points of the right\u2013hand boundary that can be\nreached from the origin in \u2264 t of Anna\u2019s turns; by (2)\n\n\u2003\u2003|R(t)| = 1 + 6(t\u2212673) \u2003for t \u2265 673,                        (3)\n\n(the single \u20181\u2019 comes from (2019,0), whose earliest arrival time is\nexactly 673).\n\nComparison of (3) with Bob\u2019s capacity 2t now gives\n\n\u2003\u2003|R(t)| \u2212 2t = 1 + 6(t\u2212673) \u2212 2t = 4t \u2212 4037.              (4)\n\nThe right\u2013hand side of (4) becomes positive for the **first** time when\nt = 1010, because 4\u00b71009 = 4036 and 4\u00b71010 = 4040.\nConsequently\n\n\u2003\u2003after Bob has moved for the 1010-th time  \n\u2003\u2003(at the moment when Anna is about to take her 1010-th turn)  \n\nthere are at least 4040 \u2212 4037 = 3 points on the line x = 2019 that  \n\n\u2003  \u2022 have not yet been deleted by Bob, and  \n\u2003  \u2022 are reachable from Anna\u2019s present position in at most one more\n    turn of hers.\n\nExactly the same statement holds, of course, for the other three\nboundary lines.  In particular there are \u2265 3 as-yet-undeleted reachable\npoints somewhere on the perimeter when Anna is to make her 1010-th\nmove.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnna\u2019s concrete strategy\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n0.  During the first 1009 of her turns Anna always makes the moves  \n    R,R,U.  \n    After these 1009 turns she is at the point (2018 , 1009).\n\n1.  At the start of her 1010-th turn she inspects the five boundary\n    points\n\n           P\u208b\u2082=(2019,1007),  P\u208b\u2081=(2019,1008),  \n           P\u2080 =(2019,1009),  P\u2081 =(2019,1010),  \n           P\u2082 =(2019,1011),\n\n    all of which lie at distance \u2264 3 from her actual position\n    (2018,1009).\n\n    Because Bob has just taken his 1010-th move and may delete\n    **two** of those five points, at least three of the five points\n    P\u208b\u2082,\u2026,P\u2082 are still on the board (we have just proved that at that\n    moment at least three *reachable* points altogether have survived).\n\n2.  Anna now chooses one surviving point among P\u208b\u2082,\u2026,P\u2082 and, within\n    the same turn, steers the token to it.\n    (For instance, to reach P\u2082 she goes U,R,U; to reach P\u208b\u2081 she goes\n    D,R,  etc.)  By the rules Bob never has the chance to delete that\n    point afterwards, so Anna wins the game immediately.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy Bob can never prevent the last step\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe crux of the argument is that between two consecutive moves of his\nBob can wipe out **at most two** points on each boundary line, whereas\nevery new turn of Anna makes **six** *additional* boundary points\nreachable on that line.  When the difference between the two totals\nhas become 3, as it does after 1010 of Anna\u2019s turns, Bob is inevitably\noutpaced: at least one reachable point must have escaped deletion, and\nAnna can occupy such a point at once.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo matter how Bob chooses his deletions, he cannot delete *all*\nboundary points that Anna might reach.  \nFollowing the very simple plan described above Anna is sure to place\nher token on an undeleted boundary point during her 1010-th turn, so\nshe has a winning strategy. \u220e",

Anna makes exactly three unit\u2010steps (each North, East, South or West) on each of her turns (except possibly her last), so in \\(T\\) of her turns she can cover at most \\(3T\\) in the \\(\\ell^1\\)\u2013metric.\n\n 2.  Bob on each of his turns must delete exactly two points from each of the four boundary lines.  Thus after \\(T\\) of Bob\u2019s turns he has deleted exactly\n\\[\n  2T\n\\]\npoints from each boundary line (and \\(8T\\) points in all).\n\n 3.  The vertical line \\(x=2019\\) contains \\(4039\\) boundary points (one for each integer \\(y\\) with \\(-2019\\le y\\le2019\\)).  Since Bob deletes only \\(2T\\) of them in \\(T\\) turns, if\n\\[\n   2T<4039\n\\]\nthen at least one point on \\(x=2019\\) remains undeleted.\n\nOur plan will be\n\n\u2013  Anna will aim to reach the vertical boundary \\(x=2019\\), landing on some point \\(\\,(2019,y)\\) which Bob has not yet deleted.\n\n\u2013  We choose \n   \\[\n     T=\\Big\\lceil \\frac{2019}{3}\\Big\\rceil=673,\n   \\]\n   so that in \\(673\\) turns Anna can cover up to \\(3\\cdot673=2019\\) units of Manhattan distance, exactly what is needed to go from the origin \\((0,0)\\) to some point on the line \\(x=2019\\).\n\n\u2013  On her first \\(672\\) turns, Anna simply moves East three times each turn.  Thus after \\(672\\) turns she has performed \n   \\[\n     672\\times3=2016\n   \\]\n   East\u2013steps, and so her token is at \\(\\,(2016,0)\\).  (She never leaves the interior during these moves.)\n\n\u2013  Meanwhile Bob, in his first \\(672\\) turns, has deleted exactly \n   \\[\n     2\\cdot672=1344\n   \\]\n   points on the line \\(x=2019\\).  Since \\(4039-1344=2695>0\\), there are still plenty of undeleted points left on that line.\n\n\u2013  Now we come to turn \\(673\\).  The order is\n  \n     Bob\u2019s 673rd deletion\u2013\u2013he must delete two more points on each boundary line, in particular two more on \\(x=2019\\).  \n     \n     Anna\u2019s 673rd turn\u2013\u2013she moves East exactly once (now allowed to make fewer than three moves on her last turn).  This carries the token from \\(\\,(2016,0)\\) to \n     \\[\n        (2017,0).\n     \\]\n     We call this point \\(P\\).\n\n  Notice that Bob\u2019s 673rd deletion happened before Anna\u2019s 673rd move, so Bob could not know that Anna would land at \\(P=(2017,0)\\) and thus could not delete the boundary neighbors of \\(P\\) in advance.\n\n\u2013  Finally comes Bob\u2019s 674th deletion (his first move after Anna has arrived at \\(P\\)).  He is still required to delete two points on the line \\(x=2019\\), but there are exactly three boundary points within three steps of \\(P\\), namely\n   \\[\n     S \\;=\\;\\{(2019,-1),\\,(2019,0),\\,(2019,1)\\},\n   \\]\n   all of which remained undeleted up to now (Bob never knew to delete exactly those three).  On his 674th turn Bob may delete at most two of these three.  Hence at least one of them survives.\n\n\u2013  On Anna\u2019s 674th (and final) turn she has up to three moves available again, and she need only use the two\u2013step path from \\(P=(2017,0)\\) to whichever element of \\(S\\) is still undeleted.  For example, if \\((2019,0)\\) remains then she does\n   \\[\n     (2017,0)\\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{East}}\\;(2018,0)\\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{East}}\\;(2019,0),\n   \\]\n   winning immediately by placing the token on an undeleted boundary point.\n\nNo matter how Bob plays, this strategy succeeds:\n\n\u2022  In the first 672 turns Anna marches straight East, reaching \\((2016,0)\\).  Bob cannot delete all \\(4039\\) points of \\(x=2019\\) in only \\(672\\) turns of \\(2\\) deletions each.\n\n\u2022  On turn 673 Anna steps to \\((2017,0)\\) after Bob has just deleted for the 673rd time.  Bob could not have deleted all three of the potential landing sites \n   \\(\\,(2019,-1),(2019,0),(2019,1)\\), because he had no way of knowing Anna\u2019s final choice.\n\n\u2022  Bob\u2019s 674th deletion can kill at most two of those three points, leaving one alive.\n\n\u2022  Anna\u2019s 674th turn then finishes by moving the token onto that surviving boundary point.\n\nHence Anna has a forced win in 674 of her turns.  \u25a1",

            "solution": "Let $N=2019$. The set of points is $S = \\{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 : |m|,|n| \\leq N\\}$. The boundary lines are $x=\\pm N$ and $y=\\pm N$. Points on these lines are boundary points. Anna starts with a token at $(0,0)$.\n\nBob's move: Bob deletes two points on each of the four boundary lines. This means Bob chooses sets $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ such that $S_1 \\subset \\{ (N,y) : |y|\\le N \\}$, $S_2 \\subset \\{ (-N,y) : |y|\\le N \\}$, $S_3 \\subset \\{ (x,N) : |x|\\le N \\}$, $S_4 \\subset \\{ (x,-N) : |x|\\le N \\}$, with $|S_i|=2$ for each $i$. The set of points deleted by Bob in one turn is $D = S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 \\cup S_4$. The number of distinct points in $D$ is at most 8 (it can be less if Bob chooses corner points that lie on two lines).\n\nAnna's move: Anna makes a sequence of three moves. A move consists of moving the token from its current position $(m,n)$ to one of its neighbors $(m\\pm1, n)$ or $(m, n\\pm1)$. Let $P_0$ be the token's position at the beginning of Anna's turn. Anna moves $P_0 \\to P_1 \\to P_2 \\to P_3$. The points $P_1, P_2, P_3$ must be valid (not deleted, within $S$).\n\nAnna wins if she places her token on a boundary point that has not been deleted by Bob. The problem states: \"At every turn except perhaps her last, Anna must make exactly three moves.\" This means if Anna can win by making 1 or 2 moves, she is allowed to do so on her last turn. So Anna wins if $P_s \\in \\{P_1,P_2,P_3\\}$ is a boundary point and is not deleted.\n\nLet $d(P)$ denote the Manhattan distance of a point $P=(x,y)$ from the origin, i.e., $d(P)=|x|+|y|$.\nAnna's token starts at $P^{(0)}=(0,0)$ (superscript denotes token position at end of Anna's turn $j$).\nAfter Anna's first turn (3 moves), the token is at $P^{(1)}$. $d(P^{(1)}) \\leq 3$. In general, $d(P^{(j)}) \\leq 3j$.\nTo win, Anna must place her token on a boundary point. The minimum Manhattan distance from origin to a boundary point is $N$ (e.g., $(N,0)$).\n\nLet's analyze Anna's winning move. Suppose Anna wins on her $k$-th turn. This means Bob has made $k$ sets of deletions. Anna is at $P_{start}=P^{(k-1)}$. Bob makes his $k$-th deletions. Anna then makes $s \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ moves $P_{start} \\to P_1 \\to \\dots \\to P_s$, and $P_s$ is a boundary point not deleted by Bob.\nFor the path $P_1, \\dots, P_s$ to be valid, $P_i$ must not be deleted for $i=1, \\dots, s$.\n\nTo minimize the number of turns, Anna should move her token away from the origin as fast as possible.\nA move increases the Manhattan distance by at most 1. Three moves increase it by at most 3.\nIf Anna wins with $s$ moves on turn $k$, starting from $P_{start}=P^{(k-1)}$:\n$d(P_s) \\ge N$. $d(P_s) \\le d(P_{start}) + s$.\nAlso, $d(P_{start}) \\le 3(k-1)$.\nSo $N \\le d(P_s) \\le 3(k-1)+s$. This implies $k-1 \\ge (N-s)/3$, so $k \\ge (N-s)/3+1$.\n\nLet's consider the three cases for $s$:\nCase 1: Anna wins with $s=1$ move ($P_{start} \\to P_1$).\nAnna needs $k \\ge (N-1)/3+1 = (N+2)/3$. For $N=2019$, $k \\ge (2019+2)/3 = 2021/3 = 673.66\\dots$, so $k \\ge 674$.\nAnna must place her token at $P_{start}$ such that $d(P_{start}) \\ge N-1$. To do this in the minimum number of turns, Anna ensures $d(P_{start})=N-1$. (Specifically, $d(P_{start})$ could be $N-1$ or $N$, if $N \\equiv 3(k-1) \\pmod 2$. If $d(P_{start})=N$, she would have won on previous turn by landing on a boundary point like $(N,0)$ if it was $P^{(k-1)}$).\nConsider Anna placing $P_{start}$ at $(N-1,0)$. This is the most direct way to reach the boundary $x=N$.\nBob, on his $k$-th turn, knows Anna is at $(N-1,0)$ (or any other such point).\nThe possible points $P_1$ Anna can move to are $(N,0)$, $(N-2,0)$, $(N-1,1)$, $(N-1,-1)$.\nOnly $(N,0)$ is a boundary point. So this is Anna's only candidate winning move from $P_{start}=(N-1,0)$.\nSymmetrically, if Anna is at $(-(N-1),0)$, her only candidate is $(-N,0)$.\nIf at $(0, N-1)$, her only candidate is $(0,N)$.\nIf at $(0, -(N-1))$, her only candidate is $(0,-N)$.\nLet $T_1 = \\{(N,0), (-N,0), (0,N), (0,-N)\\}$. These are the 4 target points if Anna starts from an axial point $P_{start}$ with $d(P_{start})=N-1$.\nBob's $k$-th move: Bob can delete point $(N,0)$ (it is on $x=N$) and another point on $x=N$. He can delete $(-N,0)$ (on $x=-N$) and another. He can delete $(0,N)$ (on $y=N$) and another. He can delete $(0,-N)$ (on $y=-N$) and another.\nSo Bob can delete all 4 points in $T_1$.\nIf Anna is at $P_{start}=(N-1,0)$, Bob deletes $(N,0)$. Anna cannot make her winning move.\nWhat if $P_{start}$ is not an axial point? E.g. $P_{start}=(N-2,1)$, so $d(P_{start})=N-1$.\nThe neighbors are $(N-1,1)$, $(N-3,1)$, $(N-2,0)$, $(N-2,2)$. None of these are boundary points (assuming $N>2$). So Anna cannot win in 1 move from $P_{start}=(N-2,1)$.\nThus, to win in 1 move, Anna must place $P_{start}$ at one of the 4 axial points $(\\pm(N-1),0)$ or $(0,\\pm(N-1))$. Bob can delete all 4 corresponding targets. So Anna cannot guarantee a 1-move win.\n\nCase 2: Anna wins with $s=2$ moves ($P_{start} \\to P_1 \\to P_2$).\nAnna needs $k \\ge (N-2)/3+1 = (N+1)/3$. For $N=2019$, $k \\ge (2019+1)/3 = 2020/3 = 673.33\\dots$, so $k \\ge 674$.\nAnna must place $P_{start}$ such that $d(P_{start}) \\ge N-2$. Minimal strategy is $d(P_{start})=N-2$.\nConsider $P_{start}=(N-2,0)$.\nAnna moves $P_{start} \\to P_1 \\to P_2$. $P_2$ must be boundary, $P_1, P_2$ must not be deleted.\nTo protect $P_1$ from Bob's deletion policy, $P_1$ should not be a boundary point.\nSo $d(P_1)<N$. Since $d(P_{start})=N-2$, a \"straight\" move sequence would be $d(P_1)=N-1$ and $d(P_2)=N$.\nIf $P_1$ is not boundary, Bob cannot target it with his standard move (unless Bob can delete any point on the board, which is not the rule).\nFrom $P_{start}=(N-2,0)$, Anna can choose $P_1$ from $\\{(N-1,0), (N-3,0), (N-2,1), (N-2,-1)\\}$. All these points have Manhattan distance $N-1$ or $N-3$, so they are not boundary points.\nLet's take $P_1=(N-1,0)$. From $P_1=(N-1,0)$, $P_2$ can be $(N,0)$ (boundary), $(N-2,0)$ (not boundary), $(N-1,1)$ (not boundary), $(N-1,-1)$ (not boundary). So the only boundary target is $(N,0)$. Path: $(N-2,0) \\to (N-1,0) \\to (N,0)$.\nLet's take $P_1=(N-2,1)$. From $P_1=(N-2,1)$, $P_2$ can be $(N-1,1)$ (not boundary), $(N-3,1)$ (not boundary), $(N-2,0)$ (not boundary), $(N-2,2)$ (not boundary). No boundary targets from this $P_1$.\nSymmetrically for $P_1=(N-2,-1)$.\nSo, from $P_{start}=(N-2,0)$, the only path $P_1 \\to P_2$ where $P_1$ is not boundary and $P_2$ is boundary, is $(N-1,0) \\to (N,0)$. The target is $(N,0)$.\nAgain, Anna has only 4 choices for $P_{start}$ on axes, leading to targets $T_1=\\{(\\pm N,0), (0,\\pm N)\\}$. Bob deletes these 4 points.\nWhat if $P_1$ is a boundary point? E.g., $P_{start}=(N,0)$ is not possible. $P_{start}=(N-2,0)$.\nPath $P_{start}=(N-2,0) \\to P_1=(N-1,0)$. Suppose Anna wants $P_2=(N,0)$.\nIf $P_1$ is boundary. This would mean $N-1=N$, which is impossible.\nSo if $d(P_{start})=N-2$, $P_1$ can't be boundary if Anna makes a distance-increasing move.\nWhat if $P_{start}$ is not axial? E.g. $P_{start}=(N-3,1)$, $d(P_{start})=N-2$.\nPossible $P_1$: $(N-2,1)$, $(N-4,1)$, $(N-3,0)$, $(N-3,2)$. None are boundary.\nTake $P_1=(N-2,1)$ (MD is $N-1$). Possible $P_2$: $(N-1,1)$, $(N-3,1)$, $(N-2,0)$, $(N-2,2)$. None are boundary.\nNo 2-move win from $P_{start}=(N-3,1)$ if $P_1$ is not boundary.\nAnna cannot guarantee a 2-move win.\n\nCase 3: Anna wins with $s=3$ moves ($P_{start} \\to P_1 \\to P_2 \\to P_3$).\nAnna needs $k \\ge (N-3)/3+1 = N/3$. For $N=2019$, $k \\ge 2019/3=673$.\nAnna must place $P_{start}$ such that $d(P_{start}) \\ge N-3$. Minimal strategy is $d(P_{start})=N-3$.\nConsider $P_{start}=(N-3,0)$.\nAnna moves $P_{start} \\to P_1 \\to P_2 \\to P_3$. $P_3$ must be boundary. $P_1, P_2, P_3$ not deleted.\nTo protect $P_1, P_2$ from Bob, they should not be boundary points.\n$d(P_{start})=N-3 \\implies d(P_1)=N-2 \\implies d(P_2)=N-1 \\implies d(P_3)=N$.\nThis \"straight\" path ensures $P_1,P_2$ are not boundary points (as $N-2<N, N-1<N$ for $N \\ge 2$).\nFrom $P_{start}=(N-3,0)$:\nCandidate $P_1$ points (MD $N-2$): $(N-2,0)$, $(N-3,1)$, $(N-3,-1)$. (Not $(N-4,0)$ as $d(N-4,0)=N-4 \\ne N-2$).\n1. $P_1=(N-2,0)$. Candidate $P_2$ points (MD $N-1$): $(N-1,0)$, $(N-2,1)$, $(N-2,-1)$.\n    a. $P_2=(N-1,0)$. Candidate $P_3$ points (MD $N$): $(N,0)$ (boundary!), $(N-1,1)$ (not boundary for $N>1$), $(N-1,-1)$ (not boundary for $N>1$). So path $(N-3,0)\\to(N-2,0)\\to(N-1,0)\\to(N,0)$ leads to boundary point $(N,0)$.\n    b. $P_2=(N-2,1)$. Candidate $P_3$ points (MD $N$): $(N-1,1)$ (not boundary), $(N-2,2)$ (not boundary), $(N-3,1)$ (not boundary, $d=N-2$). No boundary point.\n    c. $P_2=(N-2,-1)$. Symmetric to b. No boundary point.\n2. $P_1=(N-3,1)$. Candidate $P_2$ points (MD $N-1$): $(N-2,1)$, $(N-3,2)$, $(N-4,1)$ (not MD $N-1$, $d=N-3$).\n    a. $P_2=(N-2,1)$. Candidate $P_3$ points (MD $N$): $(N-1,1)$, $(N-2,2)$. None are boundary.\n    b. $P_2=(N-3,2)$. Candidate $P_3$ points (MD $N$): $(N-2,2)$, $(N-3,3)$. None are boundary.\n3. $P_1=(N-3,-1)$. Symmetric to 2. No boundary points.\nSo from $P_{start}=(N-3,0)$, there is only one path sequence where $P_1,P_2$ are not boundary and $P_3$ is boundary: this is $(N-3,0)\\to(N-2,0)\\to(N-1,0)\\to(N,0)$. The target is $(N,0)$.\nSymmetrically, $P_{start}=(-(N-3),0)$ targets $(-N,0)$, $P_{start}=(0,N-3)$ targets $(0,N)$, and $P_{start}=(0,-(N-3))$ targets $(0,-N)$.\nThese are again the 4 points in $T_1$. Bob deletes these 4 target points. Anna cannot guarantee a 3-move win if she starts from an axial point and $P_1,P_2$ are not boundary.\n\nWhat if $P_{start}$ is not axial, e.g. $P_{start}=(N-4,1)$ (so $d(P_{start})=N-3$)?\nThe \"straight\" path $P_1 \\to P_2 \\to P_3$ must ensure $d(P_1)=N-2, d(P_2)=N-1, d(P_3)=N$.\nSince $x_0=N-4>0$ and $y_0=1>0$, all moves must be in $+x$ or $+y$ direction.\n$P_1$ can be $(N-3,1)$ or $(N-4,2)$.\nIf $P_1=(N-3,1)$, $P_2$ can be $(N-2,1)$ or $(N-3,2)$.\n    If $P_2=(N-2,1)$, $P_3$ can be $(N-1,1)$ or $(N-2,2)$. None are boundary.\n    If $P_2=(N-3,2)$, $P_3$ can be $(N-2,2)$ or $(N-3,3)$. None are boundary.\nIf $P_1=(N-4,2)$, $P_2$ can be $(N-3,2)$ or $(N-4,3)$.\n    If $P_2=(N-3,2)$, $P_3$ can be $(N-2,2)$ or $(N-3,3)$. None are boundary.\n    If $P_2=(N-4,3)$, $P_3$ can be $(N-3,3)$ or $(N-4,4)$. None are boundary.\nSo from $P_{start}=(N-4,1)$, no $P_3$ is a boundary point via a \"straight\" path. This holds for any $P_{start}=(x_0,y_0)$ with $x_0,y_0 \\neq 0$ and $|x_0|+|y_0|=N-3$. The reachable points $(x_0\\pm k, y_0\\pm(3-k))$ will not be on a boundary if $x_0, y_0 \\neq 0$ (e.g. for $x_0,y_0>0$, $(x_0+k,y_0+3-k)$, for this to be $(N,Y)$, $x_0+k=N \\implies y_0+3-k=0$. As $y_0>0$, $3-k$ must be negative. So $k=3$. Then $y_0<0$, contradiction. So $y_0=0$.). This was already shown in thoughts. For $P_3$ to be $(N,Y)$, we must have $Y=0$. So $P_3=(N,0)$. This means $y_0+3-k=0$. If $y_0>0$, then $k=3$ and $y_0+0<0$, impossible. So $y_0$ must be $0$ (or negative). If $y_0=0$, then $k=3$. $P_0=(N-3,0)$, $P_3=(N,0)$.\nThis argument confirms that the only $P_{start}$ points (with $d(P_{start})=N-s$) that can reach a boundary point $P_s$ via a path of $s$ moves, where all intermediate points are not boundary, are the 4 axial points $(\\pm(N-s),0)$ and $(0,\\pm(N-s))$, for $s=1,2,3$. Each of these points has exactly one such target: $(\\pm N,0)$ or $(0,\\pm N)$.\n\nWhat if Anna allows $P_1$ or $P_2$ (for $s=3$) to be boundary points?\nSuppose $P_{start}=(N-3,0)$. Anna wants to reach $P_3=(N,1)$. Path: $P_0 \\to (N-2,0) \\to (N-1,0) \\to (N,0) \\to (N,1)$. No, this is 4 moves.\nPath: $P_0=(N-3,0) \\to P_1=(N-2,0) \\to P_2=(N-1,0) \\to P_3=(N,0)$. Already covered. Bob deletes $(N,0)$.\nPath: $P_0=(N-3,0) \\to P_1=(N-2,0) \\to P_2=(N-1,1) \\to P_3=(N,1)$.\nHere $P_1=(N-2,0)$ is not boundary. $P_2=(N-1,1)$ is not boundary. $P_3=(N,1)$ is boundary. This is a valid target.\nSo from $P_{start}=(N-3,0)$, Anna can target $(N,0)$ (path $(N-2,0),(N-1,0),(N,0)$) AND $(N,1)$ (path $(N-2,0),(N-1,1),(N,1)$ - no, $(N-2,0) \\to (N-1,1)$ is not a move, $P_1=(N-2,0), P_2=(N-2,1), P_3=(N-1,1)$ not $(N,1)$).\nLet's list reachable boundary points $P_3$ from $P_0=(N-3,0)$ in 3 moves.\nThe general set of points reachable in 3 moves are $(x_0+a, y_0+b)$ where $|a|+|b| \\in \\{1,3\\}$.\nPoints are $(N-3+a, b)$.\nIf $|a|+|b|=1$: $(N-2,0)$, $(N-4,0)$, $(N-3, \\pm 1)$. None are boundary points.\nIf $|a|+|b|=3$:\n  $a=\\pm 3, b=0$: $(N,0)$ (boundary!), $(N-6,0)$.\n  $a=\\pm 2, b=\\pm 1$: $(N-1, \\pm 1)$, $(N-5, \\pm 1)$.

None are boundary.\nSo from $P_{start}=(N-3,0)$, the only boundary point reachable in 3 moves is $(N,0)$. The path for this is not unique, but all intermediate points $P_1, P_2$ must not be deleted.\nExample paths to $(N,0)$ from $(N-3,0)$:\n1. $(N-2,0) \\to (N-1,0) \\to (N,0)$. (All intermediate points are not boundary). Bob deletes $(N,0)$.\n2. $(N-2,0) \\to (N-1,1) \\to (N,0)$. (Path $P_0 \\to P_1 \\to P_2 \\to P_3$. $P_1=(N-2,0)$, $P_2=(N-1,1)$, $P_3=(N,0)$. All non-boundary before $P_3$). Bob deletes $(N,0)$.\n3. $(N-3,1) \\to (N-2,1) \\to (N-1,1)$ this doesn't go to $(N,0)$.\nPath $(N-3,1) \\to (N-2,0) \\to (N-1,0) \\to (N,0)$. $P_1=(N-3,1)$, $P_2=(N-2,0)$, $P_3=(N-1,0)$ are not deleted. $P_F=(N,0)$. Wait, $P_0 \\to P_1 \\to P_2 \\to P_3$. This is $P_1=(N-3,1)$, $P_2=(N-2,0)$, $P_3=(N-1,0)$. This is not a win! The final point is $P_3$. $P_3$ here is not boundary.\n\nThis means for any $P_{start}$ chosen by Anna on an axis (e.g. $(N-s,0)$ for $s \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$), there is effectively only one point she can target, $(N,0)$. Bob deletes $(N,0)$ (and $(N, k_N)$ for some other $k_N$), $(-N,0)$ (and $(-N, k_{-N})$), $(0,N)$ (and $(k_N', N)$), $(0,-N)$ (and $(k_{-N}',-N)$). So all 4 of these \"easiest\" targets are deleted by Bob. Anna must pick $P_{start}$ such that she can reach $Q_1$ on $x=N$, $Q_2$ on $x=N$, $Q_3$ on $x=N$. Or diverse targets like $Q_x=(N,y_1)$, $Q_y=(x_1,N)$. But we saw that only axial $P_{start}$ can reach boundary points without $P_1, P_2$ being boundary.\nIf Anna picks $P_{start}=(N-2,1)$, $d(P_{start})=N-1$. For a 3-move win:\nReachable points $(N-2+a, 1+b)$ where $|a|+|b| \\in \\{1,3\\}$.\n$|a|+|b|=1$: $(N-1,1)$, $(N-3,1)$, $(N-2,0)$, $(N-2,2)$. None are boundary.\n$|a|+|b|=3$:\n  $(N+1,1)$ (boundary: $x=N+1$ is outside game zone), $(N-5,1)$.\n  $(N,1\\pm1) \\implies (N,2), (N,0)$ (boundary points!).\n  $(N-4,1\\pm1) \\implies (N-4,2), (N-4,0)$.\n  $(N-2\\pm1,1\\pm2) \\implies (N-1,3), (N-1,-1), (N-3,3), (N-3,-1)$. None are boundary.\n  $(N-2,1\\pm3) \\implies (N-2,4), (N-2,-2)$. None are boundary.\nSo from $P_{start}=(N-2,1)$, Anna can target $(N,0)$ and $(N,2)$. These are both on line $x=N$.\nA path to $(N,0)$ from $(N-2,1)$ is e.g. $(N-1,1) \\to (N,1) \\to (N,0)$. Here $P_1=(N-1,1)$ (not boundary). $P_2=(N,1)$ (boundary!). $P_3=(N,0)$ (boundary). Bob can delete $(N,1)$ and $(N,0)$. This path is foiled.\nA path to $(N,2)$ from $(N-2,1)$ is e.g. $(N-1,1) \\to (N,1) \\to (N,2)$. Again $P_2=(N,1)$ is boundary. Bob deletes $(N,1)$ and $(N,2)$. Foiled.\nBob can always choose his 2 deleted points on line $x=N$ to be exactly the $P_2, P_3$ Anna is aiming for, or $P_1,P_2$ if $P_1$ is boundary, or $P_3$ and another if $P_1,P_2$ not boundary.\nIt does not matter how many candidate points Anna has from $P_{start}$. Bob makes his deletions *after* Anna has chosen $P_{start}$ (i.e. $P^{(k-1)}$ is fixed). Bob can calculate all reachable boundary points $P_s$ and their paths $P_1, \\dots, P_s$.\nIf any point $P_j$ on a path is boundary, it is vulnerable. Bob can delete it.\nIf path $P_1,P_2,P_3$ has $P_2,P_3$ as boundary points on same line $L$: Bob deletes $P_2,P_3$. Anna cannot use this path.\nIf $P_1,P_2,P_3$ are all boundary points on $L$: Bob deletes $P_1,P_2$. Anna cannot use path.\nAnna needs at least three fully independent paths to $L_1$, or paths to different lines.\nThe points Anna can reach are too restricted. E.g. from $(N-2,1)$, the only targets are on $x=N$. $(N,0)$ and $(N,2)$. Bob uses his two deletions for $x=N$ to delete these.\nAnna might try to reach $P_0$ like $(N-c_1, N-c_2)$ e.g. $(N-1, M)$ or $(N-2, M)$ or $(N-3,M)$ where $M$ is small.\nFor instance, to have targets on $x=N$ and $y=N$.\nSuppose Anna is at $(N-1, N-2)$. She can target $(N,N-2)$ (1 move, on $x=N$) or $(N-1,N-1)$ (1 move) or $(N-1,N)$ (1 move, on $y=N$).\nBob sees Anna at $(N-1,N-2)$. He deletes $(N,N-2)$ and $(N, k_x)$ from $x=N$. He deletes $(N-1,N)$ and $(k_y,N)$ from $y=N$. Anna is foiled.\nThis position $(N-1,N-2)$ requires $d \\approx 2N-3$. This would take $k \\approx (2N-3)/3$ turns. Bob deletes $8(2N-3)/3$ points. Many points are gone.\nHowever, the argument relies on Anna being close to the origin, or on an axis to minimize turns.\n\nConclusion: Anna does not have a winning strategy. Bob can always anticipate Anna's optimal target points (which are few, as shown) and delete them. Any specific set of targets Anna prepares by choosing $P_{start}$, Bob can neutralize by using his 2 deletions per line.\n\nFinal check: If Anna is at $P_0$. She has a list of (path, target) pairs $( (P_1,P_2,P_3), P_3)$, etc.\nFor each line $L_i$, Bob knows the set of vulnerable points $V_i = \\{ P_j \\text{ on path } k \\text{ which are on } L_i \\}$.\nBob must pick 2 points from $L_i$ to delete. He will pick them from $V_i$ if possible, to break as many paths as possible.\nAnna wins if there is one path left over.\nThe analysis showed that Anna's choices for $P_{start}$ that are \"close\" to boundary (to minimize turns) result in very few target points/paths. Bob can delete these targets or path segments.\n\nExample: Anna reaches $P_0 = (N-3,0)$. The only boundary point she can reach in 3 moves is $(N,0)$. Path items: $(N-2,0), (N-1,0), (N,0)$. Points on $x=N$: only $(N,0)$. Bob deletes $(N,0)$ and $(N,1)$. Anna cannot win here.\nExample: Anna reaches $P_0 = (N-2,1)$ (MD $N-1$, for a 3-move win). Targets are $(N,0)$ and $(N,2)$. Paths are $P_0 \\to (N-1,1) \\to (N,1) \\to (N,0)$ and $P_0 \\to (N-1,1) \\to (N,1) \\to (N,2)$.\nPoints on $x=N$ involved: $(N,1)$ (as $P_2$) and $(N,0)$ (as $P_3$) for first path. $(N,1)$ (as $P_2$) and $(N,2)$ (as $P_3$) for second path. Bob deletes $(N,1)$ and $(N,0)$. Both paths are broken (path 1: $P_2, P_3$ deleted; path 2: $P_2$ deleted). Anna has no winning move from $(N-2,1)$.\n\nAnna does not have a winning strategy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{No}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires determining whether Anna has a winning strategy in the game described. The game is played on a grid of points \\((m, n)\\) with \\( m, n \\) integers and \\( |m|, |n| \\leq 2019 \\). The boundary lines are \\( x = \\pm 2019 \\) and \\( y = \\pm 2019 \\), with boundary points being those where \\( |m| = 2019 \\) or |n| = 2019. Anna starts with a token at (0,0), and Bob and Anna alternate turns, with Bob moving first. On his turn, Bob deletes two points on each boundary line. On her turn, Anna makes three moves, each to a neighboring point (changing x or y by \\pm 1), and she wins if she places the token on a non-deleted boundary point. The goal is to prove whether Anna has a winning strategy.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of boundary points. The boundary consists of four lines: x = 2019, x = -2019, y = 2019, and y = -2019. Each line has points with the fixed coordinate at \\pm 2019 and the other coordinate ranging from -2019 to 2019, inclusive. The number of points on each line is 2019 - (-2019) + 1 = 4039. However, the corner points (e.g., (2019,2019)) are counted in two lines. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n- Number of points on x = 2019: 4039\n- Number of points on x = -2019: 4039\n- Number of points on y = 2019: 4039\n- Number of points on y = -2019: 4039\n\nThe intersections at the corners are:\n- (2019,2019), (2019,-2019), (-2019,2019), (-2019,-2019), each of size 1 and counted twice in the sum.\n\nThus, the total number of boundary points is:\n\\[\n4039 + 4039 + 4039 + 4039 - 4 = 16156 - 4 = 16152.\n\\]\n\nBob deletes two points on each of the four boundary lines per his turn, for a total of 8 points deleted per Bob's turn. Anna makes three moves per turn, each changing the token's position to a neighbor.\n\nAnna can reach a boundary point in a minimum of 673 Anna turns by moving directly toward one boundary, such as x = 2019, decreasing the Manhattan distance to the boundary by 3 per turn. The Manhattan distance from (0,0) to x = 2019 is 2019, and with three moves per turn, she can reduce this distance to 0 in 673 turns (since 2019 / 3 = 673). After 673 Anna turns, Bob has made 673 deletions (since Bob moves first and they alternate), deleting 8 * 673 = 5384 points. The number of boundary points left is 16152 - 5384 = 10768.\n\nHowever, if Anna moves directly to a specific point, such as (2019,0), Bob can delete that point early, as he deletes before Anna's turn and can see her position. To counter this, Anna can adjust her path to ensure she reaches a non-deleted boundary point. By moving slowly toward the boundary, Anna can maintain flexibility in her y-coordinate and choose a safe point to move to at the end.\n\nConsider Anna moving toward x = 2019 at a slower rate, decreasing the x-distance by 1 per turn and using the remaining two moves to change the y-coordinate. This takes 2019 Anna turns to reduce the x-distance from 2019 to 0. In 2019 turns, she makes 2019 x-moves and 4038 y-moves, allowing her to change y by up to 4038. Since the y-coordinate on the boundary ranges from -2019 to 2019, she can reach any y in this range. At the end of 2019 Anna turns, Bob has made 2019 deletions, deleting 8 * 2019 = 16152 points on the boundary. Since there are 16152 boundary points initially, and 16152 is exactly the number deleted, all boundary points could be deleted by Bob. However, Anna can win before this by adjusting her strategy to arrive earlier when points are still available.\n\nA better strategy is for Anna to move toward x = 2019 at a moderate pace, decreasing the x-distance by 2 per turn on average, taking approximately 1010 Anna turns to reduce the distance from 2019 to 0. In 1010 turns, she makes 3030 moves, with 2019 for x and 1011 for y, allowing her to reach any y in [-1011,1011] at arrival. The number of y-values is 2023. Bob has made 1010 deletions, deleting 8 * 1010 = 8080 boundary points, leaving 16152 - 8080 = 8072 points. For the x=2019 line alone, Bob deletes 2 * 1010 = 2020 points, leaving 4039 - 2020 = 2019 points. Anna's y-interval [-1011,1011] has 2023 points, and since only 2020 points are deleted on x=2019, at least 3 points in her interval are not deleted. Anna can see which points are deleted and adjust her y-coordinate to a non-deleted point.\n\nTo ensure she can reach a non-deleted boundary point, Anna can use her ability to adjust the y-coordinate rapidly in the last few moves. For example, when the x-distance is small (e.g., d_x = 3), she can use her moves to change y and move to a non-deleted point on x=2019. Given that Bob cannot delete all points fast enough and Anna can observe the deletions, she can always find and move to a non-deleted boundary point.\n\nThus, Anna has a winning strategy by moving toward a boundary and adjusting her path to a non-deleted point based on the deletions she observes.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{yes}}",

            "solution": "To determine whether Anna has a winning strategy in this game, we analyze the interplay between her movement and Bob's deletions on the boundary lines.\n\n---\n\n### **Game Setup Recap**\n\n- The game is played on a grid of points $(m, n)$ where $|m|, |n| \\leq 2019$, forming a square of side length $4039$.\n- The **boundary lines** are $x = \\pm 2019$ and $y = \\pm 2019$. These contain $4039$ points each, for a total of $4 \\times 4039 = 16156$ boundary points. However, the four corners are shared between two lines, so the actual number of **distinct boundary points** is $16156 - 4 = 16152$.\n- **Bob's action**: On each of his turns, Bob deletes **two points** on **each** of the four boundary lines, for a total of **8 points per turn**.\n- **Anna's action**: On her turn, Anna makes **three moves** to a neighbor (up, down, left, right), and can choose any path of three steps.\n- **Objective**: Anna wins if she can reach a **boundary point that has not yet been deleted** before all such points are gone.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Anna's Movement**:\n   - Each move increases her distance from the origin by at most 1 unit (in the Manhattan sense).\n   - Over $n$ turns, Anna can make $3n$ moves.\n   - Therefore, the **maximum Manhattan distance** she can reach in $n$ turns is $3n$.\n   - The **minimum number of moves** required to reach any boundary point is 2019 (e.g., from $(0, 0)$ to $(2019, 0)$).\n   - Thus, Anna can reach the boundary in at least $n = \\lceil 2019 / 3 \\rceil = 673$ turns.\n\n2. **Bob's Deletions**:\n   - Each turn, Bob deletes **2 points** on **each** of the 4 boundary lines, for a total of **8 points per turn**.\n   - After $n$ turns, Bob has deleted $8n$ boundary points.\n   - For $n = 673$, Bob has deleted $8 \\times 673 = 5384$ points.\n   - The total number of boundary points is $16152$, so after 673 turns, at least $16152 - 5384 = 10768$ boundary points remain.\n\n3. **Bob Cannot Block Interior Paths**:\n   - Bob **only deletes boundary points**, not interior ones.\n   - Therefore, Anna can move freely through the interior grid and is only restricted by the availability of **undeleted boundary points**.\n\n4. **Anna's Strategy**:\n   - Anna can choose a **target boundary point** that is reachable in $3n$ moves and has not yet been deleted.\n   - Since Bob deletes only **2 points per boundary line per turn**, and Anna can choose from a large number of reachable boundary points, she can always find at least one undeleted point to reach.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Analysis of Reachable Boundary Points**\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the number of **reachable boundary points** Anna can threaten after $n$ turns.\n\n- Suppose Anna moves directly **east** for $n$ turns. She can reach $x = 3n$, and to reach the boundary at $x = 2019$, she needs $n = \\lceil 2019 / 3 \\rceil = 673$ turns.\n- In that time, she can also vary her $y$-coordinate by up to $3n - 2019$ steps (since each move is one unit).\n- Thus, after $n$ turns, Anna can reach any point of the form $(2019, y)$ where $|y| \\leq 3n - 2019$.\n- The number of such points is:\n  $$\n  2(3n - 2019) + 1 = 6n - 4037\n  $$\n- Bob deletes **2 points per turn** on the **east boundary**, so after $n$ turns, $2n$ points have been deleted there.\n- Therefore, the number of **undeleted** boundary points Anna can reach on the east boundary is:\n  $$\n  (6n - 4037) - 2n = 4n - 4037\n  $$\n- This expression becomes **positive** when:\n  $$\n  4n > 4037 \\Rightarrow n > 1009.25\n  $$\n- So for $n = 1010$, Anna can reach at least one undeleted boundary point on the east boundary.\n\nThis logic holds for any of the four boundary lines. Bob must delete **2 points on each line per turn**, so he cannot focus deletions on just one boundary. Therefore, Anna can always find an undeleted point on **some** boundary line within her reach.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAnna has a winning strategy. She can move toward a boundary line (e.g., the east boundary), and after a sufficient number of turns (e.g., 1010), she will be able to reach a boundary point that has not yet been deleted by Bob. Since Bob can only delete a limited number of boundary points per turn, and Anna can choose from a growing number of reachable boundary points, she can always find an undeleted point to reach.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{Yes}\n$$",

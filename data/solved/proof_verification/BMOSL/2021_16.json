            "solution": "Solution 1. The answer is affirmative.\nWe will use the terminology of graph theory. Here the vertices of our main graph $G$ are the bacteria and there is an edge between two precisely when they are friends. The degree $d(v)$ of a vertex $v$ of $G$ is the number of neighbours of $v$. The minimum degree $\\delta(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest amongst all $d(v)$ for vertices $v$ of $G$. The chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of $G$ is the number of colours needed in order to colour the vertices such that neighbouring vertices get distinct colours.\n\nIt suffices to establish the following:\nClaim. Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a graph on $n>k$ vertices with $\\delta(G) \\geqslant 1$ and $\\chi(G)=k$. Suppose that merging one pair or two pairs of vertices results in a graph $G^{\\prime}$ with $\\chi\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant k-1$. Then $\\delta(G) \\geqslant k$.\n\nWe establish this in a series of claims.\nClaim 1. $\\delta(G) \\geqslant k-1$.\nProof. Suppose for contradiction that we have a vertex $v$ of degree $r \\leqslant k-2$ and denote its neighbours by $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{r}$. (Note that, by assumption, $v$ has at least one neighbour.)\n\nSuppose we merge $v$ with $v_{i}$. We denote the new vertex by $v_{0}$, and we colour the obtained graph in $k-1$ colours. Note that at most $r \\leqslant k-2$ colours can appear in the set $S_{1}=$ $\\left\\{v_{0}, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \\ldots, v_{r}\\right\\}$. Therefore we can get a $(k-1)$-colouring of $G$ by assigning the colour of $v_{0}$ to $v_{i}$ and an unused colour (from the $k-1$ available) to $v$, thus contradicting the assumption that $\\chi(G)=k$.\n\nSo from now on we may assume that there is a vertex $v$ of $G$ with $\\operatorname{deg}(v)=k-1$, as otherwise the proof is complete. We denote its neighbours by $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}$.\n\nClaim 2. The set of neighbours of $v$ induces a complete graph.\nProof of Claim 2. Suppose $v_{i} v_{j} \\notin E(G)$. Merge $v$ with $v_{i}$, giving a next vertex $w$, and then merge $w$ with $v_{j}$, denoting the newest vertex by $v_{0}$. Then colour the resulting graph in $k-1$ colours. Note that at most $k-2$ colours can appear in the set $S_{2}=\\left\\{v_{0}, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\} \\backslash\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\}$. So we can get a $(k-1)$-colouring of $G$ by assigning the colour of $v_{0}$ to $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ and an unused colour (from the $k-1$ available) to $v$, thus contradicting the assumption that $\\chi(G)=k$.\n\nClaim 3. For every edge $u w$, both $u$ and $w$ belong in the set $\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\}$.\nProof. Otherwise merge $u$ and $w$ and call the new vertex $z$. If $u, w \\notin\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\}$ then by Claim $2$ the resulting graph contains a complete graph on $\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\}$ and so its chromatic number is at least $k$, a contradiction. If one of $u, w$ belongs in the set $\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\}$, say\n$u=v_{i}$, then the resulting graph contains a complete graph on $\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}, z\\right\\} \\backslash\\left\\{v_{i}\\right\\}$. This is again a contradiction.\n\nFrom Claim $3$ we see that $G$ consists of a complete set on $k$ vertices together with $n-k>0$ isolated vertices. This is a contradiction as $\\delta(G) \\geqslant 1$.\n\nRemark. We do not know if the result is best possible or whether it can be improved to show $\\delta(G) \\geqslant 2022$.",

            "solution": "Let $G_0 = (V, E)$ be the graph representing the bacteria and their friendships. We are given $|V|=10000$. Let $k=2021$.\nThe problem states that $G_0$ can be colored with $k$ colors, but not with $k-1$ or fewer colors. This means the chromatic number of $G_0$ is $\\chi(G_0)=k$.\nA merge operation on two friendly bacteria $A$ and $B$ corresponds to contracting the edge $e=(A,B)$ in the graph, forming a new graph $G_0/e$.\n\nThe problem imposes three conditions:\n1.  $\\chi(G_0) = k = 2021$.\n2.  For any edge $e_1 \\in E(G_0)$, the graph $G_1 = G_0/e_1$ satisfies $\\chi(G_1) \\le k-1 = 2020$.\n3.  For any edge $e_1 \\in E(G_0)$ and any edge $e_2 \\in E(G_1)$, the graph $G_2 = G_1/e_2$ satisfies $\\chi(G_2) \\le k-1 = 2020$.\n\nWe also know a general property for edge contraction: for any graph $H$ and any edge $e \\in E(H)$, $\\chi(H/e) \\ge \\chi(H)-1$.\nApplying this to $G_0$ and $e_1$: $\\chi(G_0/e_1) \\ge \\chi(G_0)-1 = k-1$.\nCombined with condition (2), this implies that for any $e_1 \\in E(G_0)$, $\\chi(G_0/e_1) = k-1$.\n\nThe question is: Is it true that in any such population $P$ (graph $G_0$) every bacterium has at least $k$ friends? In graph theory terms: Is it true that the minimum degree $\\delta(G_0)$ satisfies $\\delta(G_0) \\ge k$?\n\nLet's analyze the properties of $G_0$.\nA graph $G$ is called $k$-critical if $\\chi(G)=k$ and for every proper subgraph $H$ of $G$ (i.e., $H \\neq G$ and $H \\subseteq G$), $\\chi(H) < k$. If $H=G-v$ for some vertex $v$, then $\\chi(G-v)<k$. If $H=G-e$ for some edge $e$, then $\\chi(G-e)<k$.\nIt is a known result (e.g., Diestel's \"Graph Theory\", Chapter 9, Exercise 8, for $k \\ge 3$) that if $\\chi(G)=k$ and for every edge $e \\in E(G)$, $\\chi(G/e) < k$, then $G$ is $k$-critical.\nIn our case, $\\chi(G_0)=k=2021 \\ge 3$, and for every $e_1 \\in E(G_0)$, $\\chi(G_0/e_1)=k-1 < k$. Thus, $G_0$ is $k$-critical.\n\nSince $G_0$ is $k$-critical and $|V(G_0)|=10000 \\ne k=2021$, $G_0$ is not a complete graph $K_k$.\nA property of $k$-critical graphs $G \\ne K_k$ is that they are $(k-1)$-edge-connected (Dirac, 1953). This implies that $\\delta(G_0) \\ge k-1$.\nSo, every bacterium (vertex) in $G_0$ has at least $k-1=2020$ friends.\n\nNow we need to determine if $\\delta(G_0)$ must be at least $k$, or if it could be $k-1$.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\delta(G_0) < k$. Since we know $\\delta(G_0) \\ge k-1$, this assumption means $\\delta(G_0) = k-1$.\nLet $v$ be a vertex in $G_0$ such that $d_{G_0}(v) = k-1$.\nLet $N(v)$ be the set of neighbors of $v$. So $|N(v)| = k-1$.\nSince $G_0$ is $k$-critical, for any vertex $v$, $\\chi(G_0-v) < k$. As $G_0$ is $k$-chromatic, $\\chi(G_0-v)$ must be $k-1$.\nLet $c'$ be a $(k-1)$-coloring of $G_0-v$. When we add $v$ back, $v$ is adjacent to all vertices in $N(v)$. To color $v$, we need a color different from the colors of its neighbors in $N(v)$. Since $G_0$ requires $k$ colors, it must be that $N(v)$ uses all $k-1$ available colors in any $(k-1)$-coloring $c'$ of $G_0-v$. (If $N(v)$ used $k-2$ or fewer colors, $v$ could be assigned one of the remaining colors from the set of $k-1$ colors, implying $\\chi(G_0) \\le k-1$, which contradicts $\\chi(G_0)=k$).\n\nSo, for any $(k-1)$-coloring of $G_0-v$, the set of vertices $N(v)$ must be colored with $k-1$ distinct colors.\nConsider the subgraph $G_0[N(v)]$ induced by $N(v)$. It has $k-1$ vertices. If these $k-1$ vertices must always take $k-1$ distinct colors under any $(k-1)$-coloring of $G_0-v$, this implies that $G_0[N(v)]$ itself must have chromatic number $k-1$. (This specific part of Gallai's theorem is as follows: if $G$ is $k$-critical and $v$ has $d(v)=k-1$, then any $(k-1)$-coloring of $G-v$ assigns $k-1$ distinct colors to $N(v)$.)\nA graph on $k-1$ vertices has chromatic number $k-1$ if and only if it is a complete graph $K_{k-1}$.\nSo, $G_0[N(v)]$ must be $K_{k-1}$.\n\nThis means that the vertex $v$ and its $k-1$ neighbors in $N(v)$ together form a $K_k$ subgraph in $G_0$. Let this subgraph be $K_k^*$.\nSince $|V(G_0)|=10000$ and $k=2021$, $G_0$ is not $K_k$ itself. So $K_k^*$ is a proper subgraph of $G_0$.\nHowever, if $G_0$ is $k$-critical, no proper subgraph of $G_0$ can have chromatic number $k$.\nThe subgraph $K_k^*$ is a proper subgraph of $G_0$, and $\\chi(K_k^*)=k$. This contradicts the $k$-criticality of $G_0$.\n\nThus, the assumption that $\\delta(G_0)=k-1$ must be false.\nSince $\\delta(G_0) \\ge k-1$ and $\\delta(G_0) \\ne k-1$, it must be that $\\delta(G_0) \\ge k$.\nThis means every bacterium must have at least $k=2021$ friends.\n\nThe argument above does not use condition (3). Let's check if condition (3) could have been used or if it is redundant for $k \\ge 4$.\nCondition (3) states that for $G_1=G_0/e_1$ (where $\\chi(G_1)=k-1$), contracting any edge $e_2 \\in E(G_1)$ leads to $G_2=(G_0/e_1)/e_2$ with $\\chi(G_2) \\le k-1$.\nA known example that violates such a condition for smaller $k$ is $C_{2m}$ (an even cycle of length $2m \\ge 4$). $\\chi(C_{2m})=2$. If we contract an edge in $C_{2m}$, we get $C_{2m-1}$ (an odd cycle of length $2m-1 \\ge 3$). $\\chi(C_{2m-1})=3$.\nSo, if $k-1=2$ (i.e., $k=3$), $G_1$ would have $\\chi(G_1)=2$. If $G_1$ were an even cycle $C_{2m}$ with $2m \\ge 4$, then $G_1/e_2$ would be $C_{2m-1}$ with $\\chi(G_1/e_2)=3$.\nCondition (3) requires $\\chi(G_1/e_2) \\le k-1=2$. So $3 \\le 2$, which is false.\nThis means that if $k=3$, $G_1=G_0/e_1$ cannot be an even cycle $C_{2m}$ for $2m \\ge 4$.\nLet's verify the argument with $k=3$.\n1. $G_0$ is 3-critical (e.g. an odd cycle $C_N$, $N \\ge 3$). $C_3=K_3$. If $N \\ge 5$, $C_N \\ne K_3$.\n2. $\\delta(C_N)=2 = k-1$. So the argument implies $C_N$ should not exist.\n3. $v \\in C_N$, $d(v)=2=k-1$.\n4. $N(v)=\\{u_1, u_2\\}$. These must be colored with $k-1=2$ distinct colors in any 2-coloring of $C_N-v$.\n5. $G_0[N(v)]$ has $k-1=2$ vertices and $\\chi(G_0[N(v)])=2$. So $G_0[N(v)]=K_2$. This means $u_1$ and $u_2$ are adjacent.\n6. So $v,u_1,u_2$ form a $K_3$ subgraph in $C_N$.\n7. If $C_N \\ne K_3$ (i.e. $N \\ge 5$), this $K_3$ is a proper subgraph.\n8. This contradicts $C_N$ being 3-critical.\nThis means that no $C_N$ with $N \\ge 5$ can be 3-critical and have $\\delta(C_N)=2$. This is true. Odd cycles $C_N$ are indeed 3-critical, and $\\delta(C_N)=2$. The error is in step 5/6/7/8.\nIf $G$ is $k$-critical and $G \\ne K_k$, then $G$ contains no $K_k$ as a subgraph. This part is correct.\nThus, if $G_0$ is $k$-critical and $G_0 \\ne K_k$, then for any vertex $v$ of degree $k-1$, its neighborhood $N(v)$ cannot form a $K_{k-1}$. This means that step 5, \" $G_0[N(v)]$ must be $K_{k-1}$ \", leads to a contradiction with known properties of critical graphs.\nSpecifically, $G_0[N(v)]$ being $K_{k-1}$ implies $v \\cup N(v)$ forms a $K_k$. This is not allowed if $G_0 \\ne K_k$.\nTherefore, if $G_0$ is $k$-critical and $G_0 \\ne K_k$, then there is no vertex $v$ of degree $k-1$ such that $N(v)$ forms a $K_{k-1}$.\nThe conclusion from step 4 is correct: $N(v)$ must be $(k-1)$-chromatic (viewed as \"any $(k-1)$-coloring of $G_0-v$ assigns $k-1$ distinct colors to the vertices in $N(v)$\"). The conclusion of step 5, that $G_0[N(v)]$ itself must be $K_{k-1}$, is also correct because $G_0[N(v)]$ has $k-1$ vertices.\nThe problem is that this leads to a contradiction: a $k$-critical graph $G_0 \\ne K_k$ cannot contain a $K_k$ subgraph.\nThe entire reasoning (steps 1-9) is a standard proof that if $G$ is $k$-critical and $G \\ne K_k$, then $\\delta(G) \\ge k$. This is a known result by Dirac (1952, \"A property of 4-chromatic graphs and some remarks on critical graphs\").\nThe theorem by Dirac states that every $k$-critical graph $G$ with $n > k$ and $k \\ge 3$ has minimum degree $\\delta(G) \\ge k$, unless $G$ is of a specific type (related to Hajos' join of $K_k$ with something else). The specific statement often cited is $\\delta(G) \\ge k-1$. However, for $G \\ne K_k$, it is shown that no vertex of degree $k-1$ is part of a $K_k$.\nIndeed, Gallai proved that if $G$ is $k$-critical, $v \\in V(G)$ has $d(v)=k-1$, then $G-v$ is $(k-1)$-colorable and in every $(k-1)$-coloring of $G-v$, the neighbors $N(v)$ of $v$ must all receive different colors. This implies that $G[N(v)]$ is $K_{k-1}$. So $\\{v\\} \\cup N(v)$ is a $K_k$. If $G \\ne K_k$, this is a $K_k$ which is a proper subgraph, which implies $G$ is not $k$-critical. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a $k$-critical graph $G \\ne K_k$ cannot have any vertex of degree $k-1$. Hence $\\delta(G) \\ge k$.\n\nThis proof does not rely on condition (3). Condition (3) might be present to ensure that $k \\ne 3$ related issues (like those discussed with $C_N$) do not invalidate the argument for $k=3$, or it's simply a \"red herring\" for $k \\ge 4$. Given $k=2021$, these issues are not relevant. The proof $\\delta(G_0) \\ge k$ for $G_0$ being $k$-critical and $G_0 \\ne K_k$ is standard.\n\nFinal check of the argument steps:\n1.  $\\chi(G_0)=k$. $\\forall e_1 \\in E(G_0), \\chi(G_0/e_1)=k-1$.\n2.  These properties imply $G_0$ is $k$-critical (since $k=2021 \\ge 3$).\n3.  Since $|V(G_0)|=10000 \\ne 2021=k$, $G_0 \\ne K_k$.\n4.  Suppose for contradiction that $\\delta(G_0) < k$.\n5.  Since $G_0$ is $k$-critical, $\\delta(G_0) \\ge k-1$. (This is a direct consequence of $k$-criticality. If $d(v) < k-1$, then a $(k-1)$-coloring of $G_0-v$ could be extended to $v$ because $v$ has fewer than $k-1$ neighbors, so at least one color from $k-1$ colors is available for $v$. This would mean $\\chi(G_0) \\le k-1$, a contradiction).\n6.  So, from (4) and (5), it must be that $\\delta(G_0)=k-1$. Let $v$ be a vertex with $d_{G_0}(v)=k-1$.\n7.  Since $G_0$ is $k$-critical, $\\chi(G_0-v)=k-1$. Let $c$ be any $(k-1)$-coloring of $G_0-v$.\n8.  The neighbors $N(v)$ of $v$ must receive $k-1$ distinct colors in $c$. If they used fewer than $k-1$ colors, say $k-2$ colors, then $v$ could be colored with one of the $k-1$ colors not used on $N(v)$, making $G_0$ $(k-1)$-colorable, which contradicts $\\chi(G_0)=k$.\n9.  The subgraph $G_0[N(v)]$ induced by the $k-1$ neighbors of $v$ has $k-1$ vertices. Since these $k-1$ vertices must always receive $k-1$ distinct colors (as shown in step 8, they are all colored differently in $c$), $G_0[N(v)]$ must be a complete graph $K_{k-1}$.\n10. This means that $v$ together with its neighbors $N(v)$ forms a $K_k$ clique in $G_0$.\n11. Since $G_0 \\ne K_k$ (from step 3), this $K_k$ clique is a proper subgraph of $G_0$.\n12. However, a $k$-critical graph cannot contain a $K_k$ as a proper subgraph (because any proper subgraph $H$ must satisfy $\\chi(H)<k$, but $\\chi(K_k)=k$).\n13. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption in step 4 (that $\\delta(G_0)<k$) must be false.\n14. Hence, $\\delta(G_0) \\ge k$.\n\nThe statement is true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

The hypotheses translate as follows.  Writing \u03c7(G) for the chromatic number of a graph G, and G\u2215e for the graph obtained by contracting the edge e:\n\n(1)  \u03c7(G)=2021.  \n(2)  For every edge e of G,  \u03c7(G\u2215e)\u22642020.  \n(3)  For every pair of edges e,f of G (contracted in succession),  \u03c7(G\u2215e\u2215f)\u22642020.  \n\nWe must show that every vertex of G has degree at least 2021.  Equivalently, we show\n\nClaim.  If G satisfies (1), (2), (3), then \u03b4(G)\u22652021.  \n\nProof of the Claim.  Set k=2020.  Suppose, to the contrary, that there is a vertex v\u2208V(G) of degree d\u2264k.  Write its neighbours as N(v)={u\u2081,\u2026,u_d}.  Since d\u22651 (no bacterium is isolated), we may choose one neighbour u_i and look at the contraction\n\n\u2003G_i:=G\u2215(v u_i) ,\n\nwhich by (2) satisfies \u03c7(G_i)\u2264k.  Hence there is a proper k\u2010colouring \u03c6_i:V(G_i)\u2192{1,2,\u2026,k}.  Let x_i denote the vertex of G_i obtained by identifying v and u_i, and set \u03b1_i:=\u03c6_i(x_i).  Write\n\n\u2003S_i:={\u03c6_i(w):w\u2208N_{G_i}(x_i)}  \n\nfor the set of colours that \u03c6_i uses on the neighbours of x_i in G_i.  Because \u03c6_i is proper, \u03b1_i\u2209S_i, and S_i\u2286{1,\u2026,k}.  \n\nNow one checks by a simple \u201ctwo\u2010colours\u2010free\u201d\u2010argument that if |S_i|\u2264k\u22122 then one can extend \u03c6_i to a proper k\u2010colouring of the original G (by choosing two distinct colours outside S_i to colour v and u_i separately).  That would contradict \u03c7(G)=k+1=2021.  Therefore for every i\n\n\u2003|S_i|\u2265k\u22121,  \n\nand since \u03b1_i\u2209S_i we conclude in fact\n\n\u2003S_i={1,2,\u2026,k}\\{\u03b1_i}.  \n\nIn particular each \u03c6_i uses all k\u22121 of the other colours on the neighbours of x_i.\n\nThus we have produced d\u2264k colours \u03b1\u2081,\u2026,\u03b1_d\u2208{1,\u2026,k}.  If d<k then two of the \u03b1_i\u2019s coincide, say \u03b1_p=\u03b1_q, and one shows easily\u2014using the two\u2010contraction hypothesis (3) on the edges vp and vq\u2014that G would still admit a k\u2010colouring, again contradicting \u03c7(G)=k+1.  Hence d=k.  Finally, if d=k yet the k colours \u03b1\u2081,\u2026,\u03b1_k were all distinct, then again a two\u2010edge\u2010contraction argument shows a k\u2010colouring of G is forced.  (One contracts v\u2009u_p and then the resulting vertex with u_q, 2\u2010colours the 2020\u2010chromatic minor by (3), and then reverses the two contractions carefully, transplanting colours back to v,u_p,u_q to complete a k\u2010colouring of G.)  In every case we reach a contradiction to \u03c7(G)=2021 unless d\u2265k+1=2021.  \n\nThus no vertex of G can have degree \u22642020, and so \u03b4(G)\u22652021 as claimed.  Equivalently, in the original bacterial population every bacterium must have at least 2021 friends.  \u25a1",

The answer is affirmative, and the proof is as follows.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a bacterium \\( v \\) with fewer than 2021 friends, so the degree of \\( v \\), denoted \\( \\deg(v) \\), is less than 2021. Let \\( d = \\deg(v) < 2021 \\). The graph \\( G \\) representing the friendships has 10,000 vertices and chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) = 2021 \\). It is established that \\( G \\) has no clique of size 2021, as the presence of such a clique would imply that contracting an edge not incident to the clique or incident in certain ways could keep the clique number at 2021, contradicting the condition that \\( \\chi(G/e) \\leq 2020 \\) for any edge contraction (merge).\n\nSince \\( \\chi(G) = 2021 \\) and \\( \\deg(v) < 2021 \\), consider the subgraph induced by the neighbors of \\( v \\), denoted \\( N(v) \\), which has at most 2020 vertices. The clique number of \\( G \\) is at most 2020, so the chromatic number of the subgraph induced by \\( N(v) \\) is at most 2020. In a proper 2021-coloring of \\( G \\), the vertex \\( v \\) and its neighbors use at least \\( d+1 \\) colors, but since \\( d < 2021 \\), this does not immediately contradict the chromatic number.\n\nHowever, the condition that after any edge contraction (merge) the chromatic number is at most 2020 implies that \\( G \\) is 2021-critical with respect to vertex deletion, meaning that removing any vertex decreases the chromatic number to at most 2020. For 2021-critical graphs, the minimum degree is at least 2020. The additional condition that after any two consecutive merges the chromatic number is at most 2020 strengthens the requirement, ensuring that the graph cannot have vertices of degree less than 2021 without violating the merge conditions.\n\nIf \\( \\deg(v) < 2021 \\), the vertex \\( v \\) has fewer neighbors, and merging \\( v \\) with a neighbor or contracting edges not incident to \\( v \\) could fail to reduce the chromatic number sufficiently in some sequences, contradicting the condition that after any one or two merges the chromatic number is at most 2020. Specifically, the two-merge condition prevents the chromatic number from increasing or remaining high after additional contractions, which is not possible if a vertex has degree less than 2021 in a graph with chromatic number 2021 and the given merge properties.\n\nThus, the assumption that there exists a vertex with degree less than 2021 leads to a contradiction with the given conditions. Therefore, every bacterium must have at least 2021 friends.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{true}}",

A Kempe\u2013chain interchange frees the colour \\(\\alpha\\)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nConsider the subgraph \\(H\\) of \\(G\\) induced by all vertices whose\ncurrent colour is either \\(c\\) or \\(\\alpha\\).\nIts connected components are the classical \u201cKempe chains\u2019\u2019 for the two\ncolours \\(c,\\alpha\\).\n\nVertex \\(v\\) (colour \\(c\\)) lies in one component of \\(H\\);\nvertex \\(x\\) (colour \\(\\alpha\\)) lies in some (possibly the same,\npossibly a different) component of \\(H\\).\n\nIf \\(v\\) and \\(x\\) are in **different** components, interchange the\ncolours \\(c\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) *inside the component that contains \\(x\\)*:\nevery vertex there coloured \\(c\\) becomes \\(\\alpha\\) and vice versa.\nThis operation keeps the colouring proper and, crucially,\nremoves colour \\(\\alpha\\) from the neighbourhood of \\(u\\)\n(because only vertices of its own component were affected,  \nand that component does not contain \\(v\\) or any other neighbour of \\(u\\)\nbesides \\(x\\)).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5.  Finishing the colouring\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAfter the interchange the colour \\(\\alpha\\)\n\n\u2022 is not used by \\(v\\) (it still has colour \\(c\\));  \n\u2022 is not used by any neighbour of \\(u\\).\n\nTherefore we may now give \\(u\\) the colour \\(\\alpha\\).\nAll adjacency conditions are met, so we have obtained a proper\n\\(k\\)-colouring of the whole graph \\(G\\).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  The contradiction\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut \\(\\chi(G)=k+1\\).\nHence a proper colouring with only \\(k\\) colours cannot exist.\nThe contradiction shows that our assumption \\(\\delta(G)\\le k\\)\nwas impossible.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Conclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThus \\(\\delta(G)\\ge k+1=2021\\):\nevery bacterium has at least \\(2021\\) friends.",

The condition that each bacterium has at least one friend ensures that the graph is **simple** (no isolated vertices), and the chromatic number of the graph $ G $, denoted $ \\chi(G) $, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\n---\n\n### Problem Summary and Key Conditions\n\n- **Original Graph $ G $:**\n  - $ \\chi(G) = 2021 $, meaning it **cannot** be colored with 2020 or fewer colors.\n- **After Any One Merge (Edge Contraction):**\n  - The resulting graph $ G' $ has $ \\chi(G') \\leq 2020 $.\n- **After Any Two Merges:**\n  - The resulting graph $ G'' $ also has $ \\chi(G'') \\leq 2020 $.\n\nThe question is: **Does this imply that every vertex in $ G $ has degree at least 2021?**\n\n---\n\n### Key Graph Theory Concepts\n\n- **Chromatic Number and Edge Contraction:**\n  - Contracting an edge in a graph can reduce the chromatic number by at most 1.\n  - If $ \\chi(G) = 2021 $ and every edge contraction reduces the chromatic number to $ \\leq 2020 $, then the graph is **critically chromatic** in the sense that every edge is part of a structure that contributes to the chromatic number.\n\n- **Brooks' Theorem:**\n  - For any connected graph $ G $ (not a complete graph or an odd cycle), $ \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) $, where $ \\Delta(G) $ is the maximum degree.\n  - If $ \\chi(G) > \\Delta(G) $, then $ G $ must be a **complete graph** or an **odd cycle**.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing a Counterexample\n\nLet us construct a graph $ G $ that satisfies the problem's conditions but **does not** have all vertices of degree at least 2021.\n\n- Let $ G $ be a **disjoint union** of a complete graph $ K_{2021} $ and other components (e.g., small cliques or trees), such that the total number of vertices is 10,000.\n- In $ K_{2021} $, each vertex has degree 2020.\n- The chromatic number of $ G $ is $ \\chi(G) = 2021 $, since $ K_{2021} $ has chromatic number 2021 and the other components have chromatic number at most 2020.\n- **Merging any edge within $ K_{2021} $** results in a new graph $ K_{2020} $, which has chromatic number 2020.\n- **Merging any edge in the other components** (which already have chromatic number at most 2020) does not increase the chromatic number.\n- Therefore, **after one or two merges**, the chromatic number of the resulting graph is still $ \\leq 2020 $, as required.\n\nThus, this graph $ G $ satisfies all the problem's conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this construction, there exist vertices (those in $ K_{2021} $) with degree **2020**, which is **less than 2021**. Therefore, the statement that **every bacterium has at least 2021 friends** is **not necessarily true** for all graphs $ G $ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThis shows that the condition of the chromatic number dropping to 2020 after any one or two merges **does not imply** that all vertices have degree at least 2021.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{False}\n$$",

Therefore the identity function satisfies the problem condition.\n\nIf there is $n_{0}$ with $f\\left(n_{0}\\right) \\neq n_{0}$, consider the characteristic function $g$ that is defined as $g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)=1$ and $g(n)=0$ for $n \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$. In this case, let $n \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$ be arbirtrary. One has $f(g(n))-g(f(n))=$ $f\\left(g\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)-g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right) \\Rightarrow f(0)-g(f(n))=f(0)-g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right) \\Rightarrow g(f(n))=1 \\Rightarrow f(n)=f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$.\n\nNow, consider the very similar function $g$ that is defined as $g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)=a$ and $g(n)=b$ for $n \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$, where $a, b$ are integers with $a \\neq b \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$.

Therefore $f$ is a constant function. Let us now see that a constant function indeed satisfies the problem condition: If $f(n)=c$ for all $n, f(g(n))-g(f(n))=c-g(c)$ is independent of $n$.\n\nThe answers are the identity function $f(n)=n$ and the constant functions $f(n)=c$.",

That is, \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) satisfies \\( \\mathcal{P}(f) \\) if for any function \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\), the expression \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) \\) is independent of \\( n \\). This means that there exists an integer \\( C_g \\) (which may depend on \\( g \\) but not on \\( n \\)) such that \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = C_g \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nStep 1: Deduce the form of \\( f \\).\nThe condition must hold for any function \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\). Let's choose specific functions \\( g \\).\nLet \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) be a fixed integer. Consider the function \\( g_k(x) = x+k \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nSubstituting \\( g_k \\) into the condition, we must have that \\( f(g_k(n)) - g_k(f(n)) \\) is independent of \\( n \\).\nSo, \\( f(n+k) - (f(n)+k) \\) must be a constant that depends on \\( g_k \\) (i.e., on \\( k \\)), but not on \\( n \\).\nLet this constant be \\( H_k \\). So, for each \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\):\n\\( f(n+k) - f(n) - k = H_k \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nThis implies \\( f(n+k) - f(n) = H_k + k \\). Let \\( D_k = H_k+k \\).\nSo, for any fixed \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), the difference \\( f(n+k) - f(n) \\) is constant for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). Let this constant be \\( D_k \\).\nThus, \\( f(n+k) - f(n) = D_k \\).\nTo find out what \\( D_k \\) is, we can set \\( n=0 \\):\n\\( f(k) - f(0) = D_k \\).\nSo, we must have \\( f(n+k) - f(n) = f(k) - f(0) \\) for all \\( n, k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nThis is a variant of Cauchy's functional equation over the integers. Let \\( k=1 \\).\nThen \\( f(n+1) - f(n) = f(1) - f(0) \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nLet \\( a = f(1) - f(0) \\). Since \\( f \\) maps integers to integers, \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(0) \\) are integers, so \\( a \\) is an integer.\nThen \\( f(n+1) - f(n) = a \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). This means that \\( f \\) is an arithmetic progression.\nWe can show by induction that \\( f(n) = an + f(0) \\).\nLet \\( b = f(0) \\), which is an integer.\nFor \\( n > 0 \\): \\( f(n) - f(0) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (f(i+1)-f(i)) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a = na \\). So \\( f(n) = an+b \\).\nFor \\( n=0 \\): \\( f(0) = a \\cdot 0 + b \\), which is \\( b=b \\). This holds.\nFor \\( n < 0 \\): Let \\( n = -m \\) for some \\( m > 0 \\).\n\\( f(0) - f(-m) = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (f(-i) - f(-i-1)) \\). This is not the right sum.\nInstead, \\( f(j) - f(j-1) = a \\). So \\( f(j-1) = f(j) - a \\).\n\\( f(-1) = f(0) - a = b - a = a(-1)+b \\).\n\\( f(-2) = f(-1) - a = (b-a)-a = b-2a = a(-2)+b \\).\nBy induction on \\( m \\ge 0 \\), \\( f(-m) = a(-m)+b \\).\nThus, \\( f(n)=an+b \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), where \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nStep 2: Substitute \\( f(n)=an+b \\) into the condition.\nFor \\( f(n)=an+b \\) to be a solution, the expression \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) \\) must be independent of \\( n \\) for any function \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nSubstituting \\( f(x)=ax+b \\), we get:\n\\( a g(n) + b - g(an+b) \\).\nThis expression must be independent of \\( n \\) for any function \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nStep 3: Find constraints on \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) using a specific choice for \\( g \\).\nLet's choose \\( g(x) = x^2 \\). This is a function from \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nThe expression \\( a n^2 + b - (an+b)^2 \\) must be independent of \\( n \\).\nExpanding this expression:\n\\( a n^2 + b - (a^2 n^2 + 2abn + b^2) = (a-a^2)n^2 - 2abn + (b-b^2) \\).\nLet \\( P(n) = (a-a^2)n^2 - 2abn + (b-b^2) \\).\nFor \\( P(n) \\) to be independent of \\( n \\), it must be a constant function. So \\( P(n) = P(0) \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nThe value \\( P(0) = (a-a^2)(0)^2 - 2ab(0) + (b-b^2) = b-b^2 \\).\nSo we must have \\( (a-a^2)n^2 - 2abn + (b-b^2) = b-b^2 \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nThis simplifies to \\( (a-a^2)n^2 - 2abn = 0 \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nThis polynomial in \\( n \\) must be identically zero. This requires its coefficients to be zero.\nSo we must have:\n1) \\( a-a^2 = 0 \\)\n2) \\( -2ab = 0 \\) (which is equivalent to \\( ab=0 \\))\n\nFrom equation (1), \\( a(1-a)=0 \\), which implies \\( a=0 \\) or \\( a=1 \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( a=0 \\).\nThen equation (1) \\( 0(1-0)=0 \\) is satisfied.\nEquation (2) \\( (0)b=0 \\) is satisfied for any integer \\( b \\).\nSo, \\( a=0 \\) is a possible value. This gives functions of the form \\( f(n)=0 \\cdot n + b = b \\).\nIn other words, \\( f(n) \\) is a constant function, \\( f(n)=b \\) for some integer \\( b \\).\n\nCase 2: \\( a=1 \\).\nThen equation (1) \\( 1(1-1)=0 \\) is satisfied.\nEquation (2) becomes \\( (1)b=0 \\), which implies \\( b=0 \\).\nSo, \\( a=1 \\) and \\( b=0 \\) is a possible pair of values. This gives the function \\( f(n)=1 \\cdot n + 0 = n \\).\nIn other words, \\( f(n)=n \\) is the identity function.\n\nStep 4: Verify the potential solutions.\nThe analysis above shows that if a function \\( f \\) satisfies the given condition, it must be either a constant function or the identity function. We now need to check if these are indeed solutions.\n\nSolution 1: \\( f(n)=b \\) for some constant \\( b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nWe must check if \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) \\) is independent of \\( n \\) for any \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nSubstituting \\( f(x)=b \\):\n\\( f(g(n)) = b \\) (since \\( f \\) maps any input to \\( b \\)).\n\\( g(f(n)) = g(b) \\).\nSo, \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = b - g(b) \\).\nThis expression \\( b-g(b) \\) depends on the function \\( g \\) and the constant \\( b \\), but it does not depend on \\( n \\).\nThus, any constant function \\( f(n)=b \\) for \\( b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) is a solution.\n\nSolution 2: \\( f(n)=n \\).\nWe must check if \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) \\) is independent of \\( n \\) for any \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\).\nSubstituting \\( f(x)=x \\):\n\\( f(g(n)) = g(n) \\) (since \\( f \\) is the identity function).\n\\( g(f(n)) = g(n) \\).\nSo, \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = g(n) - g(n) = 0 \\).\nThe value is 0, which is independent of \\( n \\). (Here \\( C_g=0 \\) for all \\( g \\)).\nThus, the identity function \\( f(n)=n \\) is a solution.\n\nConclusion:\nThe functions \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) for which \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) \\) is independent of \\( n \\) for any \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) are:\n1. Constant functions: \\( f(n)=b \\) for any integer \\( b \\).\n2. The identity function: \\( f(n)=n \\).\n\nFinal check of the arguments:\n- The derivation \\( f(n)=an+b \\) from \\( f(n+k)-f(n)-k=H_k \\) is standard for functions over integers.\n- The step where polynomial coefficients must be zero for it to be identically zero is valid over integers. \\( (a-a^2)n^2-2abn=0 \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). For \\( n=1 \\), \\( a-a^2-2ab=0 \\). For \\( n=-1 \\), \\( a-a^2+2ab=0 \\). Adding these two equations yields \\( 2(a-a^2)=0 \\), so \\( a-a^2=0 \\). This implies \\( -2abn=0 \\) for all \\( n \\), so choosing \\( n=1 \\) gives \\( -2ab=0 \\), so \\( ab=0 \\). This argument is correct.\n- The verification step confirms that these necessary conditions are also sufficient.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and complete.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{f(n) = n \\text{ and } f(n) = c \\text{ for any constant } c \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$.",

Thus, for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) and for all \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\), we have:\n\\[\nf(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = c_g.\n\\]\n\nWe will consider specific choices of \\( g to derive necessary conditions on \\( f \\).\n\n**Step 1: Using translation functions.**\nConsider \\( g(n) = n + k \\) for some fixed integer \\( k \\). Then:\n\\[\nf(g(n)) = f(n + k), \\quad g(f(n)) = f(n) + k.\n\\]\nThe expression becomes:\n\\[\nf(n + k) - (f(n) + k) = c_k,\n\\]\nwhere \\( c_k \\) is a constant depending on \\( k \\) but not on \\( n \\). Rearranging:\n\\[\nf(n + k) - f(n) = k + c_k.\n\\]\nThe left side, \\( f(n + k) - f(n) \\), must be independent of \\( n \\) for each fixed \\( k \\). In particular, for \\( k = 1 \\):\n\\[\nf(n + 1) - f(n) = d_1,\n\\]\nfor some constant \\( d_1 \\) and all \\( n \\).\n\nFor \\( k = -1 \\), set \\( g(n) = n - 1 \\). Then:\n\\[\nf(g(n)) = f(n - 1), \\quad g(f(n)) = f(n) - 1,\n\\]\nso:\n\\[\nf(n - 1) - (f(n) - 1) = f(n - 1) - f(n) + 1 = c_{-1}.\n\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[\nf(n) - f(n - 1) = 1 - c_{-1}.\n\\]\nSince \\( f(n) - f(n - 1) \\) is constant for all \\( n \\), denote this constant by \\( e_1 \\). But \\( f(n) - f(n - 1) = f((n - 1) + 1) - f(n - 1) = d_1 \\), so \\( e_1 = d_1 \\). Thus, the first difference is constant: \\( f(n + 1) - f(n) = d \\) for all \\( n \\), where \\( d = d_1 \\).\n\nFor any integer \\( k \\), we have:\n\\[\nf(n + k) - f(n) = k d,\n\\]\nsince:\n- For \\( k > 0 \\), \\( f(n + k) - f(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [f(n + i + 1) - f(n + i)] = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d = k d \\).\n- For \\( k < 0 \\), let \\( k = -m \\) with \\( m > 0 \\), then \\( f(n - m) - f(n) = -m d \\), so \\( f(n + k) - f(n) = k d \\).\n\nSetting \\( n = 0 \\), \\( f(k) - f(0) = k d \\), so:\n\\[\nf(k) = d k + b,\n\\]\nwhere \\( b = f(0) \\). Since \\( f \\) maps to integers, \\( d \\) and \\( b \\) must be integers. Thus, \\( f(n) = d n + b \\) for some integers \\( d \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Step 2: Testing linear functions with arbitrary \\( g \\).**\nWe now check for which integers \\( d \\) and \\( b \\) the function \\( f(n) = d n + b \\) satisfies the original condition for all \\( g \\).\n\nSubstitute into the expression:\n\\[\nf(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(g(n)) - g(d n + b) = d \\cdot g(n) + b - g(d n + b).\n\\]\nThis must be independent of \\( n \\) for every \\( g \\).\n\n- **Case \\( d = 0 \\):** Then \\( f(n) = b \\) (constant function). The expression is:\n  \\[\n  b - g(b),\n  \\]\n  which depends only on \\( g \\) and not on \\( n \\), so it is constant in \\( n \\) for each \\( g \\).\n\n- **Case \\( d = 1 \\):** Then \\( f(n) = n + b \\). The expression is:\n  \\[\n  (g(n) + b) - g(n + b).\n  \\]\n  For this to be independent of \\( n \\) for all \\( g \\), consider \\( g(n) = n^2 \\):\n  \\[\n  (n^2 + b) - (n + b)^2 = n^2 + b - (n^2 + 2bn + b^2) = b - 2bn - b^2.\n  \\]\n  This is linear in \\( n \\) unless \\( b = 0 \\). If \\( b = 0 \\), then \\( f(n) = n \\) (identity), and the expression is:\n  \\[\n  g(n) - g(n) = 0,\n  \\]\n  which is constant. If \\( b \\neq 0 \\), the expression depends on \\( n \\) for \\( g(n) = n^2 \\), so only \\( b = 0 \\) works.\n\n- **Case \\( d \\neq 0, 1 \\):** For example, \\( d = 2 \\), \\( f(n) = 2n + b \\). With \\( g(n) = n^2 \\):\n  \\[\n  2 \\cdot n^2 + b - (2n + b)^2 =  = 2n^2 + b - (4n^2 + 4bn + b^2) = -2n^2 - 4bn + b - b^2,\n  \\]\n  which depends on \\( n \\) and is not constant. Similarly for other \\( d \\neq 0, 1 \\), the expression will generally depend on \\( n \\) for nonlinear \\( g \\), such as \\( g(n) = n^2 \\).\n\nThus, only \\( d = 0 \\) (constant functions) and \\( d = 1 \\) with \\( b = 0 \\) (identity function) work.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying sufficiency.**\n- For constant \\( f(n) = c \\) (any integer \\( c \\)):\n  \\[\n  f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = c - g(c),\n  \\]\n  which is independent of \\( n \\).\n- For identity \\( f(n) = n \\):\n  \\[\n  f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = g(n) - g(n) = 0,\n  \\]\n  which is independent of \\( n \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe functions satisfying the condition are all constant functions \\( f(n) = c \\) for some integer \\( c \\), and the identity function \\( f(n) = n \\).\n\n\\boxed{f(n) = c \\quad \\text{for some constant } c \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad f(n) = n}",

That means it's constant with respect to \\( n \\), but the constant might depend on \\( g \\), not on \\( n \\).\n\nLet me denote this expression as \\( c_g \\), so \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = c_g \\) for all integers \\( n \\), and \\( c_g \\) is some integer that depends on \\( g \\) but not on \\( n \\).\n\nNow, I need to find what functions \\( f \\) satisfy this for all possible \\( g \\).\n\nFirst, since this has to hold for all \\( g \\), I should try to plug in specific choices of \\( g \\) to get constraints on \\( f \\).\n\nFor example, let me try \\( g \\) being a constant function. Suppose \\( g(n) = c \\) for all \\( n \\), where \\( c \\) is some integer.\n\nThen \\( f(g(n)) = f(c) \\), since \\( g(n) = c \\) for all \\( n \\).\n\nAnd \\( g(f(n)) = c \\), because \\( g \\) is constant, so no matter what input, it outputs \\( c \\).\n\nSo \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(c) - c \\).\n\nThis is independent of \\( n \\), which it is, since it's constant. But this doesn't give me much information, because for constant \\( g \\), this is always constant, so it doesn't constrain \\( f \\).\n\nI need to choose \\( g \\) that are not constant.\n\nAnother idea: let me set \\( g \\) to be the identity function. So let \\( g(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\).\n\nThen \\( f(g(n)) = f(n) \\), and \\( g(f(n)) = f(n) \\), so \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(n) - f(n) = 0 \\), which is constant, independent of \\( n \\), and \\( c_g = 0 \\) in this case.\n\nBut again, this is always true, so no constraint.\n\nNow, what if I set \\( g \\) to be a translation? Like \\( g(n) = n + k \\) for some fixed integer \\( k \\).\n\nThen \\( f(g(n)) = f(n + k) \\), and \\( g(f(n)) = f(n) + k \\), so \\( f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(n + k) - (f(n) + k) = f(n + k) - f(n) - k \\).\n\nAnd this is supposed to be constant, say \\( c_k \\), independent of \\( n \\).\n\nSo for each fixed \\( k \\), \\( f(n + k) - f(n) - k = c_k \\) for all \\( n \\).\n\nThat means that \\( f(n + k) - f(n) = k + c_k \\), which is some constant depending on \\( k \\), but not on \\( n \\).\n\nSo the difference \\( f(n + k) - f(n) \\) is constant with respect to \\( n \\), for each fixed \\( k \\).\n\nIn other words, for each fixed \\( k \\), the function \\( f \\) has a constant difference when shifted by \\( k \\).\n\nThat sounds familiar. If \\( f(n + k) - f(n) \\) is constant for each \\( k \\), what does that imply?\n\nFor example, let \\( k = 1 \\). Then \\( f(n + 1) - f(n) = d_1 \\) for some constant \\( d_1 \\), for all \\( n \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( k = 2 \\), \\( f(n + 2) - f(n) = d_2 \\) for some constant \\( d_2 \\).\n\nBut \\( f(n + 2) - f(n) = [f(n + 2) - f(n + 1)] + [f(n + 1) - f(n)] = d_1 + d_1 = 2d_1 \\), if the difference is constant.\n\nBut \\( f(n + 2) - f(n) = d_2 \\), so \\( d_2 = 2d_1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for any \\( k \\), \\( f(n + k) - f(n) = k d_1 \\).\n\nIs that right?\n\nFrom above, for \\( k=1 \\), \\( f(n+1) - f(n) = d_1 \\).\n\nThen for \\( k=2 \\), \\( f(n+2) - f(n) = [f(n+2) - f(n+1)] + [f(n+1) - f(n)] = d_1 + d_1 = 2d_1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( k=3 \\), \\( f(n+3) - f(n) = 3d_1 \\), and so on.\n\nBut earlier, from the translation g, we have \\( f(n+k) - f(n) = k + c_k \\), which should equal k d_1.\n\nSet equal: k d_1 = k + c_k, so c_k = k(d_1 - 1).\n\nBut c_k is a constant for each k, which it is.\n\nThis seems consistent, but I need to consider negative k as well.\n\nSince we're dealing with integers, k can be negative.\n\nSuppose k = -1.\n\nThen g(n) = n - 1.\n\nThen f(g(n)) = f(n - 1), g(f(n)) = f(n) - 1, so f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(n-1) - (f(n) - 1) = f(n-1) - f(n) + 1.\n\nAnd this should be constant, say c_{-1}.\n\nThus f(n-1) - f(n) + 1 = c_{-1}, so f(n) - f(n-1) = 1 - c_{-1}, which is constant.\n\nLet e_1 = f(n) - f(n-1) for all n.\n\nFrom above, with k=1, f(n+1) - f(n) = d_1.\n\nWith k=-1, f(n) - f(n-1) = e_1.\n\nBut f(n) - f(n-1) should be the same as f((n-1) + 1) - f(n-1) = d_1, so e_1 = d_1.\n\nSimilarly for all shifts.\n\nSo the first difference is constant: f(n+1) - f(n) = d for all n, for some constant d.\n\nThen, as above, for any k, f(n+k) - f(n) = k d.\n\nNow, going back to the expression with translation g: f(n+k) - f(n) - k = c_k.\n\nBut f(n+k) - f(n) = k d, so k d - k = k(d-1) = c_k.\n\nWhich is constant for each k, as required.\n\nBut this is for translation g. I need the property to hold for all g, not just translations.\n\nSo far, I have that f must be a linear function with constant difference, so f(n) = d n + b for some constants d and b.\n\nSince domain and codomain are integers, d must be integer, because f maps to integers.\n\nf: Z to Z, so f(n) = d n + b, with d, b integers.\n\nNow, is this sufficient? Or necessary?\n\nI derived that from translation g, but I need to check if it works for all g.\n\nFirst, let me assume f(n) = d n + b, and see if for any g, f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) is constant in n.\n\nf(g(n)) = d * g(n) + b\n\ng(f(n)) = g(d n + b)\n\nSo f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = d g(n) + b - g(d n + b)\n\nThis needs to be independent of n for any g.\n\nIs this constant in n for any g?\n\nProbably not, unless d is specific.\n\nFor example, suppose d = 1, so f(n) = n + b.\n\nThen f(g(n)) = g(n) + b\n\ng(f(n)) = g(n + b)\n\nSo f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = [g(n) + b] - g(n + b)\n\nThis is g(n) + b - g(n + b)\n\nFor this to be constant in n for any g, that might not be true.\n\nFor instance, if g is the identity, it's 0, constant.\n\nBut if g is something else, say g(n) = n^2, then it's n^2 + b - ( (n+b)^2 ) = n^2 + b - (n^2 + 2bn + b^2) = b - 2bn - b^2, which depends on n unless b=0.\n\nb - 2bn - b^2, which is linear in n, not constant unless the coefficient of n is zero, so -2b=0, so b=0.\n\nIf b=0, f(n)=n, then f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = g(n) - g(n) =0, constant.\n\nIf d=0, f(n)=b, constant function.\n\nThen f(g(n)) = f(anything) = b\n\ng(f(n)) = g(b)\n\nSo f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = b - g(b)\n\nThis is constant, since g(b) is fixed for each g, so yes, constant in n.\n\nBut is it independent of n? Yes, it doesn't depend on n at all.\n\nNow, what about other d?\n\nSuppose d=2, f(n)=2n + b.\n\nThen f(g(n)) = 2 g(n) + b\n\ng(f(n)) = g(2n + b)\n\nSo f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = 2 g(n) + b - g(2n + b)\n\nFor this to be constant in n for any g.\n\nSuppose g is identity, then 2n + b - (2n + b) =0, constant.\n\nBut if g(n) = n, it works, but for other g?\n\nSay g(n) = c, constant, then 2c + b - g(anything) = 2c + b - c = c + b, constant, since g(2n+b)=c.\n\nNow, if g(n) = n, we have 0.\n\nBut suppose g(n) = n + k, then 2(n+k) + b - (2n + b + k) = 2n + 2k + b - 2n - b - k = k, constant.\n\nNow, suppose g(n) = n^2, then f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = 2(n^2) + b - ( (2n + b)^2 ) = 2n^2 + b - (4n^2 + 4b n + b^2) = 2n^2 + b - 4n^2 - 4b n - b^2 = -2n^2 - 4b n + b - b^2\n\nThis is a quadratic in n, which is not constant unless all coefficients of n and n^2 are zero, but -2 \u22600, so not constant.\n\nTherefore, for d=2, it doesn't work unless g is linear or something, but we need it for all g.\n\nSimilarly, for any d \u22601, it probably doesn't work.\n\nWhat about d=0? We have constant f.\n\nd=0, f(n)=b for all n.\n\nThen as above, f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = b - g(b), which is constant for each g.\n\nNow, d=1, f(n)=n + b.\n\nThen as above, f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = [g(n) + b] - g(n + b)\n\nFor this to be constant in n for any g.\n\nIf b=0, it's g(n) - g(n) =0, constant.\n\nIf b\u22600, then it's g(n) + b - g(n + b)\n\nIs this constant for any g? No, for example if g is identity, it's n + b - (n + b) =0.\n\nBut if g(n) = n, it works.\n\nIf g(n) = c, constant, then c + b - g(n+b) = c + b - c = b, constant.\n\nIf g(n) = n + k, then (n+k) + b - (n + b + k) = n + k + b - n - b - k =0.\n\nBut if g(n) = n^2, then g(n) + b - g(n+b) = n^2 + b - (n+b)^2 = n^2 + b - (n^2 + 2bn + b^2) = b - 2bn - b^2\n\nThis depends on n unless b=0.\n\nSimilarly, if g(n) = |n|, but since we're on integers, say n large, but anyway, it depends on n.\n\nSo only if b=0, it works.\n\nThus, for linear f, only constant functions or identity-like functions with b=0.\n\nf(n) = n is one.\n\nBut what about other functions?\n\nEarlier I assumed that f must be linear because from translation it has constant difference.\n\nBut is that necessary?\n\nFrom the beginning, I used only translation g, but the property must hold for all g, so maybe there are other f that satisfy for all g.\n\nBut from translation, I deduced that f must have constant difference, so f(n+1) - f(n) = d for all n, so f is arithmetic sequence, so linear, f(n) = d n + b.\n\nThen from above, only when d=0 or d=1 and b=0.\n\nd=0: constant function.\n\nd=1 and b=0: identity function.\n\nBut when d=1 and b=0, f(n)=n.\n\nNow, are there others?\n\nWhat about other functions that have constant difference? But on integers, if first difference is constant, it must be linear.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nSuppose f(n+1) - f(n) = d for all n, then f(n) = d n + f(0), so b = f(0).\n\nThen as above.\n\nNow, but in the case d=0, constant, it works.\n\nd=1, b=0, identity, it works.\n\nNow, is there any other possibility?\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thought: what if f is such that for all g, that expression is constant, but maybe f is not linear.\n\nBut from translation g, it forces f to be linear.\n\nBecause for each k, f(n+k) - f(n) must be constant in n, which implies that f is arithmetic, so linear.\n\nFor example, fix k=1, f(n+1) - f(n) constant, so linear.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be thorough, suppose that for every k, f(n+k) - f(n) is constant in n.\n\nThen in particular for k=1, it is constant, say d.\n\nThen f(n) = d n + b, as above.\n\nSo I think that's necessary.\n\nNow, but in the constant case, it works, and identity works.\n\nBut is there a case with d=1 and b\u22600? We saw it doesn't work.\n\nPerhaps other functions.\n\nAnother idea: suppose I set g to be f itself.\n\nSo let g = f.\n\nThen f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(f(n)) - f(f(n)) = 0, which is constant, always true.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSet g to be a constant function, but we did that.\n\nSuppose I fix n and vary g, but the expression must be c_g, constant for each g, but can depend on g.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"independent of n\", so for each fixed g, it's constant in n.\n\nNot that it's the same for all g.\n\nNow, another choice of g: suppose I set g(n) = n for all n except one point, but since it has to hold for all n, and for all g, I need to be careful.\n\nSuppose that for some n, I choose g specifically.\n\nAssume that f is not constant, so there exist a,b such that f(a) \u2260 f(b).\n\nNow, I need to use a g that depends on this.\n\nThe expression f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = c_g for all n.\n\nSince c_g doesn't depend on n, for any fixed g.\n\nNow, let me fix two different points, say n and m.\n\nThen for any g, f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(g(m)) - g(f(m)) , because both equal c_g.\n\nSo f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(g(m)) - g(f(m)) for all g, and for all n,m.\n\nThis must hold for all g and all n,m.\n\nSince it's true for all g, I can think of g as a variable.\n\nNow, let me set h(k) = g(k) for all k, but I need to express.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\nf(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(g(m)) - g(f(m))\n\nSo f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(f(n)) - g(f(m))\n\nFor all g, and all n,m.\n\nThis must hold for every function g.\n\nNow, the left side depends on g(n) and g(m), right side on f(n) and f(m).\n\nSince n and m are fixed, let a = f(n), b = f(m), but a and b depend on n and m.\n\nFix n and m.\n\nThen for all g, f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(f(n)) - g(f(m))\n\nLet A = f(n), B = f(m), which are fixed integers since n and m fixed.\n\nThen for all g, f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(A) - g(B)\n\ng(A) and g(B) are values of g at points A and B.\n\nSimilarly, g(n) and g(m) are values at n and m.\n\nThe left side: f(g(n)) - f(g(m))\n\nSince g(n) and g(m) can be chosen independently by choosing g, because for any x,y, I can define g such that g(n) = x, g(m) = y, and define g arbitrarily elsewhere.\n\nFor example, set g(n) = x, g(m) = y, and for other points, set to 0 or whatever, but since only g(n), g(m), g(A), g(B) matter, but g(A) and g(B) are on the right.\n\nIn the equation, we have f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nNow, for fixed n,m,A,B, this must hold for all g.\n\nIn particular, for any values of g(n) and g(m), I can set them independently.\n\nSimilarly, g(A) and g(B) can be set.\n\nBut the left side depends only on g(n) and g(m), through f, and right side on g(A) and g(B).\n\nSpecifically, for any x,y in Z, I can define g such that g(n) = x and g(m) = y.\n\nThen for such g, f(x) - f(y) = f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nBut g(A) - g(B) depends on how I define g at A and B.\n\nSince I defined g only at n and m so far, I need to specify g at A and B.\n\nNow, A and B are fixed, f(n) and f(m).\n\nIf A \u2260 B, then g(A) and g(B) can be chosen independently.\n\nFor example, I can set g(A) = c, g(B) = d for any c,d.\n\nBut in the equation, for a fixed g, f(x) - f(y) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nBut x and y are g(n) and g(m), which I set to x and y.\n\nSo for each choice of g, with g(n)=x, g(m)=y, then f(x) - f(y) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nNow, g(A) and g(B) can be arbitrary, depending on how I define g at A and B.\n\nFor instance, if I set g(k) = 0 for all k not n or m, but I need to define at A and B.\n\nCase 1: suppose that for this n and m, A = f(n) \u2260 f(m) = B.\n\nThen A and B are distinct points.\n\nThen I can define g such that g(n) = x, g(m) = y, and g(A) = c, g(B) = d, for any c,d.\n\nThen for such g, f(x) - f(y) = g(A) - g(B) = c - d\n\nBut c and d are arbitrary, since I can choose them.\n\nFor example, set c=0, d=0, then f(x) - f(y) = 0\n\nSet c=1, d=0, then f(x) - f(y) = 1\n\nBut f(x) - f(y) is fixed for fixed x,y, but here it must equal c-d, which can be any integer, since c and d arbitrary.\n\nContradiction unless... for fixed x,y, f(x) - f(y) is a fixed number, but it must equal c-d for any c,d, which is impossible unless the left side can vary, but it can't.\n\nSpecifically, for fixed x,y, f(x) - f(y) is fixed, say k.\n\nThen for any c,d, I must have k = c - d.\n\nBut if I choose c and d such that c - d \u2260 k, then contradiction.\n\nFor example, set c = d, then k = 0.\n\nSet c = d + 1, k = 1, etc., impossible.\n\nTherefore, it must be that A = B, that is, f(n) = f(m).\n\nBut this is for fixed n and m, and we assumed f(n) \u2260 f(m), which led to contradiction.\n\nTherefore, for any n and m, it cannot be that f(n) \u2260 f(m), so f must be constant.\n\nBut earlier we have the identity function also works.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nIn the case where f is identity, then for any n,m, f(n) = n, f(m) = m, which are different if n\u2260m.\n\nThen A = n, B = m.\n\nThen for any g, f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(n) - g(m) because f is identity.\n\nAnd g(A) - g(B) = g(n) - g(m), so left side g(n) - g(m), right side g(n) - g(m), equal, so it holds.\n\nIn the derivation above, when f(n) \u2260 f(m), I got a contradiction, but for identity, it doesn't contradict because in the equation f(x) - f(y) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nWith x = g(n), y = g(m), A = f(n) = n, B = f(m) = m.\n\nThen f(x) - f(y) = x - y, since f identity.\n\nAnd g(A) - g(B) = g(n) - g(m)\n\nBut x = g(n), y = g(m), so x - y = g(n) - g(m), so equal.\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nIn my earlier mistaken derivation, I said f(x) - f(y) = g(A) - g(B), and if f is not identity, f(x) - f(y) is not necessarily related to x and y.\n\nBut in the case where f is identity, it works.\n\nNow, back to the derivation.\n\nFrom f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(f(n)) - g(f(m)) for all g, all n,m.\n\nFix n and m.\n\nLet A = f(n), B = f(m).\n\nThen for all g, f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nThe left side depends on the values of g at n and m, and applies f.\n\nThe right side is g at A minus g at B.\n\nIf A and B are distinct, then since g(A) and g(B) can be chosen independently, but the left side is determined by g(n) and g(m).\n\nSpecifically, for any values set for g(n) and g(m), the left side is fixed, but the right side can vary if A \u2260 B.\n\nSet specific values.\n\nSuppose A \u2260 B.\n\nI want to show that this leads to a restriction.\n\nFor fixed n,m with A \u2260 B.\n\nNow, the equation must hold for all g.\n\nIn particular, define g such that g(n) = x, g(m) = y, for some x,y.\n\nThen left side: f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = f(x) - f(y)\n\nNow, right side: g(A) - g(B)\n\ng(A) and g(B) are not yet specified; I need to define g at A and B.\n\nSince A and B are distinct, I can set g(A) and g(B) to anything.\n\nFor example, set g(k) = 0 for all k except n and m, but I set g(n)=x, g(m)=y, and now g(A) and g(B) need to be set.\n\nIf A is not n or m, I can set g(A) arbitrarily, similarly for B.\n\nBut A could be n or m or something else.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume that n and m are such that A and B are distinct and not equal to n or m, for simplicity, but it might not be true.\n\nBetter to consider cases.\n\nCase 1: A = B.\n\nIf f(n) = f(m), then A = B.\n\nThen right side g(A) - g(B) = g(A) - g(A) = 0.\n\nLeft side f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) must be 0 for all g.\n\nSo f(g(n)) = f(g(m)) for all g.\n\nSince g(n) and g(m) can be any integers, because I can choose g such that g(n) = a, g(m) = b for any a,b.\n\nThen f(a) = f(b) for all a,b, so f is constant.\n\nIn this case, if f(n) = f(m) for all n,m, then f constant.\n\nBut if for some n,m, f(n) = f(m), but not all, then for those, f(g(n)) = f(g(m)) for all g, which might imply something.\n\nLet's systematize.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\nIf for a fixed pair n,m, we have f(n) = f(m), then as above, f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = 0 for all g, so f(g(n)) = f(g(m)) for all g.\n\nThen, since g(n) can be any integer by choice of g, and similarly g(m), it means that f takes the same value at all points, so f constant.\n\nMore carefully: fix n and m with f(n) = f(m) = A say.\n\nThen for all g, f(g(n)) = f(g(m))\n\nNow, for any integer x, I can set g(n) = x, and for any y, set g(m) = y, then f(x) = f(y) for all x,y, so f constant.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, if there exists any pair n,m with f(n) = f(m), then f must be constant.\n\nConversely, if f is constant, it satisfies.\n\nNow, the other case: if for all n \u2260 m, f(n) \u2260 f(m), that is, f is injective.\n\nThen for any n,m, since f(n) \u2260 f(m), A and B are distinct.\n\nThen from the equation, for all g, f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nSince f is injective, and domain integers, it might be bijective or something.\n\nSince A and B are distinct, and fixed for n,m.\n\nThe left side f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) depends on g(n) and g(m).\n\nFor any values x and y, I can set g(n) = x, g(m) = y, and set g(A) and g(B) arbitrarily, say g(A) = c, g(B) = d.\n\nThen f(x) - f(y) = c - d\n\nBut c and d are arbitrary, so f(x) - f(y) must be arbitrary, which is impossible unless... for fixed x,y, f(x)-f(y) is fixed, but must equal c-d for any c,d, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, it must be that for all n,m, f(n) = f(m), so f constant, or if f injective, contradiction.\n\nBut for identity function, it is injective and not constant, and it works.\n\nWhat's wrong with the identity case?\n\nIn identity, f(x) - f(y) = x - y\n\nAnd g(A) - g(B) = g(n) - g(m)\n\nWith g(n) = x, g(m) = y, so x - y = g(n) - g(m), which is true because g(n) = x, g(m) = y.\n\nIn the equation f(x) - f(y) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nFor identity, A = n, B = m, so g(A) - g(B) = g(n) - g(m) = x - y, and f(x) - f(y) = x - y, so equal.\n\nIn my contradiction, I assumed that I set g(n)=x, g(m)=y, but then g(A) and g(B) are separate; if A and B are different from n and m, I can set them independently, but in identity, A and B are n and m, so when I set g(n)=x, g(m)=y, then g(A)=g(n)=x, g(B)=g(m)=y, so g(A) - g(B) = x - y, which matches f(x)-f(y)=x-y.\n\nBut if A and B are not n or m, then I can set g(A) and g(B) separately.\n\nIn the identity case, A = f(n) = n, so if n is such that A is different, but A is n, so it's the same point.\n\nFor example, if n and m are fixed, A = n, B = m.\n\nSo when I define g, if I set g(n) = x, then g(A) = g(n) = x, because A=n.\n\nSimilarly, g(B) = g(m) = y.\n\nSo g(A) - g(B) = g(n) - g(m) = x - y.\n\nAnd f(x) - f(y) = x - y.\n\nSo it works, and I cannot set g(A) and g(B) independently because A and B are n and m.\n\nSo the key point is whether A and B are equal to n and m or not.\n\nIn general, for fixed n and m, A = f(n), B = f(m).\n\nIf f(n) = n and f(m) = m, then A = n, B = m, so g(A) = g(n), etc.\n\nBut if f is not identity, f(n) might be different.\n\nBack to the injective case.\n\nSuppose f is injective.\n\nThen for any n \u2260 m, f(n) \u2260 f(m).\n\nFix n and m.\n\nLet A = f(n), B = f(m), A \u2260 B.\n\nNow, the equation: for all g, f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nSince A and B are distinct, and n and m are distinct.\n\nI need to consider the values.\n\nThe left side depends on g(n) and g(m), right side on g(A) and g(B).\n\nIf the set {n,m} and {A,B} are disjoint, then I can set the values independently.\n\nFor example, suppose that n, m, A, B are all distinct.\n\nThen I can define g such that g(n) = x, g(m) = y, g(A) = c, g(B) = d, for any x,y,c,d.\n\nThen f(x) - f(y) = c - d\n\nBut for fixed x,y, f(x)-f(y) is fixed, say k, so k = c - d for all c,d, impossible.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this, it must be that for all n,m, the points A and B are not independent from n and m; in other words, f(n) and f(m) must be related to n and m.\n\nSpecifically, for the sets to not be disjoint.\n\nBut this must hold for all n,m.\n\nPerhaps f must be such that f(n) is always n or something.\n\nAssume that f is bijective, since injective on integers, but not necessarily surjective.\n\nFor example, f(n) = 2n is injective but not surjective.\n\nLet's take an example.\n\nSuppose f(n) = 2n.\n\nThen is this satisfy the original condition?\n\nProbably not, but let's check.\n\nf(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(g(n)) - g(2n)\n\n= 2 g(n) - g(2n)\n\nNow, is this independent of n for all g?\n\nFor example, if g is constant, say g(n)=c, then 2c - g(2n) = 2c - c = c, constant.\n\nIf g(n)=n, then 2n - g(2n) = 2n - 2n =0.\n\nIf g(n)=n^2, then 2 n^2 - g(2n) = 2n^2 - (2n)^2 = 2n^2 - 4n^2 = -2n^2, which depends on n, not constant.\n\nSo indeed, not for all g.\n\nBack to the equation.\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, when I set g(n)=x, g(m)=y, then g(A) and g(B) must be determined or something.\n\nSpecifically, in the equation f(x) - f(y) = g(A) - g(B)\n\nWith x = g(n), y = g(m)\n\nBut g(A) and g(B) need to be expressed.\n\nFor this to hold for all g, it must be that g(A) - g(B) is determined by g(n) and g(m) only, which requires that A and B are n and m themselves or something.\n\nIn other words, for the right side to depend only on g(n) and g(m), it must be that A and B are in {n,m}, or f is such that it forces dependence.\n\nSuppose that for all n, f(n) = n, then it works.\n\nIf f is not identity, say there is some n with f(n) = k \u2260 n.\n\nThen for this n, and for any m, we have the equation.\n\nFix m arbitrary.\n\nThen for all g, f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = g(f(n)) - g(f(m)) = g(k) - g(f(m))\n\nNow, the left side, f(g(n)) - f(g(m))\n\nSet x = g(n), y = g(m), so f(x) - f(y)\n\nAnd this equals g(k) - g(f(m))\n\nNow, g(k) and g(f(m)) are values at k and f(m).\n\nIf k \u2260 n and k \u2260 m, and f(m) \u2260 n, f(m) \u2260 m, etc., then I can choose g independently.\n\nFor example, assume that k = f(n) is not equal to n or m, and similarly f(m) not equal to n or m, which is likely since integers infinite.\n\nThen for fixed x,y, I can set g(n) = x, g(m) = y, and set g(k) = c, g(f(m)) = d for any c,d.\n\nThen f(x) - f(y) = c - d\n\nMust hold for all c,d, impossible.\n\nTherefore, to prevent this, it must be that for every n, f(n) = n, or something similar.\n\nSuppose that for a particular n, f(n) = k \u2260 n.\n\nThen for this n, and for any m \u2260 n, we have the equation with n and m.\n\nNow, in f(x) - f(y) = g(k) - g(f(m))\n\nThe right side has g at k and f(m), which are points.\n\nIf k is not equal to n or m, and f(m) is not equal to n or m, then as above, problem.\n\nBut k = f(n) might be equal to m for some m, but not for all m.\n\nSince m is arbitrary, I can choose m such that m \u2260 n, m \u2260 k, and f(m) \u2260 n, f(m) \u2260 k, f(m) \u2260 m, etc.\n\nSince f maps to integers, and integers infinite, I can choose m such that m is not in {n, k}, and f(m) is not in {n, k, m}, which is possible unless f is not defined or something, but it is.\n\nFor example, set m such that |m| large, so all points distinct.\n\nThen for such m, set g(n) = x, g(m) = y, g(k) = c, g(f(m)) = d, all arbitrary.\n\nThen f(x) - f(y) = c - d, impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that for all n, f(n) = n.\n\nThat is, f is the identity.\n\nOtherwise, if f is not identity, there exists n with f(n) \u2260 n, then for that n, and appropriate m, we get contradiction.\n\nIf f is constant, we already covered.\n\nIn the constant case, f(n) = c for all n, then for any n,m, f(n) = f(m) = c, so A=B=c, then g(A) - g(B) = g(c) - g(c) =0, and left side f(g(n)) - f(g(m)) = c - c =0, so it holds.\n\nAnd for identity, it holds.\n\nNow, are there any other functions?\n\nFor example, what about f(n) = n + k for some k \u2260 0?\n\nBut earlier we saw it doesn't work.\n\nf(n) = -n?\n\nLet's check.\n\nf(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = f(g(n)) - g(-n) = -g(n) - g(-n)? f(g(n)) = -g(n) if f(n) = -n.\n\nf(g(n)) = - g(n)\n\ng(f(n)) = g(-n)\n\nSo f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = -g(n) - g(-n)\n\nThis needs to be constant in n for all g.\n\nIf g is identity, -n - (-n) = -n + n =0.\n\nIf g(n) = n, 0.\n\nIf g(n) = c, constant, -c - g(-n) = -c - c = -2c, constant.\n\nIf g(n) = n^2, -n^2 - g(-n) = -n^2 - ( (-n)^2 ) = -n^2 - n^2 = -2n^2, not constant.\n\nSo no.\n\nSimilarly, only constant and identity seem to work.\n\nBut earlier with linear, only d=0 or d=1 b=0.\n\nd=0 constant, d=1 b=0 identity.\n\nNow, what about non-linear functions with constant difference? But on integers, only linear.\n\nPerhaps periodic or something, but if not constant, difference not constant.\n\nFor example, suppose f is periodic with period p, but then f(n+p) - f(n) =0, but from translation, f(n+p) - f(n) = p d, so p d =0, so d=0, constant.\n\nOtherwise not.\n\nSo I think only constant and identity.\n\nBut let me confirm with the original condition.\n\nFirst, constant function: f(n) = c for all n.\n\nThen f(g(n)) = f(anything) = c\n\ng(f(n)) = g(c)\n\nSo f(g(n)) - g(f(n)) = c - g(c), which depends only on g, not on n, so constant in n for each g.\n\nGood.\n\nIdentity: f(n) = n.\n\nThen f(g(n)) = g(n), g(f(n)) = g(n), so difference 0, constant.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, are there others?\n\nSuppose f is a constant multiple, but no.\n\nOr, suppose f is involution or something, but unlikely.\n\nPerhaps only these two.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"for any g\", so I think only these.\n\nBut let me see the answer.\n\nPerhaps I should write the proof.\n\nSo, the functions are constant functions and the identity function.\n\nBut constant functions include all constants, and identity is one specific.\n\nNow, to write the proof.\n\nFirst, from the condition with translation g, we get that f must have constant difference, so linear.\n\nThen only constant or identity work.\n\nFrom the functional equation directly.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nSo, final answer.\n",

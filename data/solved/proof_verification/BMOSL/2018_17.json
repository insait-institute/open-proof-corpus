That is,\n\n\\[ n! + f(m)! \\mid f(n)! + f(m!) \\]\n\nfor all m, n in the natural numbers.\n\nFirst, since we're dealing with factorials and divisibility, I should consider properties of factorials. Factorials grow very quickly, and divisibility by them might impose strong conditions.\n\nAlso, the function f maps to natural numbers, so f(k) is some natural number for each k.\n\nI should start by plugging in specific values for m and n to get some constraints on f.\n\nLet me try setting n = 1. When n=1, n! = 1! = 1.\n\nSo the condition becomes:\n\n\\[ 1 + f(m)! \\mid f(1)! + f(m!) \\]\n\nSince f maps to natural numbers, f(1)! is some factorial, and similarly for others.\n\nf(1) is some natural number, say a, so f(1)! = a!.\n\nSimilarly, f(m)! is the factorial of f(m), which is some number.\n\nNow, 1 + f(m)! divides a! + f(m!).\n\nf(m)! is generally large for m large, but let's see.\n\nI could set m=1 as well.\n\nSet m=1.\n\nThen f(m)! = f(1)! = a!, say.\n\nAnd f(m!) = f(1!) = f(1) = a.\n\nm! when m=1 is 1! =1, so f(m!) = f(1) = a.\n\nSo the condition with n arbitrary and m=1:\n\n\\[ n! + f(1)! \\mid f(n)! + f(1!) \\]\n\nThat is,\n\n\\[ n! + a! \\mid f(n)! + a \\]\n\nSince f(1!) = f(1) = a.\n\nNow, a is a fixed natural number, since f(1) is fixed.\n\nSimilarly, for n=1, m arbitrary:\n\n\\[ 1 + f(m)! \\mid a! + f(m!) \\]\n\nI need to consider the size of these expressions.\n\nFactorials grow fast, so for large n, n! is large, and f(n)! might be even larger, depending on f.\n\nI could assume that f is the identity function and see if it works.\n\nSuppose f(n) = n for all n.\n\nThen the condition is n! + m! divides n! + m!, which is true since anything divides itself. n! + f(m)! = n! + m!, and f(n)! + f(m!) = n! + (m!)!.\n\nm! is m factorial, and (m!)! is factorial of m!, which is much larger.\n\nSo n! + m! divides n! + (m!)! ?\n\nFor example, take m=2, n=1.\n\nn! + f(m)! = 1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nf(n)! + f(m!) = f(1)! + f(2!) = 1! + f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3? f(2) =2, f(2!) = f(2) =2? 2! =2, f(2) =2, so f(m!) = f(2) =2.\n\nSo 3 divides 3, ok.\n\nBut for larger m, say m=3, n=1.\n\nn! + f(m)! =1! + 3! =1+6=7\n\nf(n)! + f(m!) = f(1)! + f(6) =1! +6=1+6=7, since f(k)=k.\n\nf(6)=6, so yes.\n\nNow, if n=2, m=3.\n\nn! + f(m)! =2! +3! =2+6=8\n\nf(n)! + f(m!) = f(2)! + f(6) =2! +6=2+6=8, ok.\n\nBut is it always true? f(m!) = f( (m)! ) , and if f is identity, f(k)=k, so f(m!) = m!.\n\nBut in the expression, it's f(n)! + f(m!) , which is (f(n))! + f(m!).\n\nIf f(n)=n, then n! + m! , and left side is n! + m! , so it divides itself only if f(n)! + f(m!) = n! + m!, but f(n)! = n! , and f(m!) = (m!)! if f is identity? No.\n\nf is applied first, then factorial.\n\nf(m!) means f evaluated at m!, so if f(k)=k for all k, then f(m!) = m!.\n\nThen f(n)! = (f(n))! = n!.\n\nSo left side: n! + f(m)! = n! + m!\n\nRight side: f(n)! + f(m!) = n! + m!\n\nSo yes, equal, so it divides.\n\nBut in this case, f(m!) = m!, not (m!)!.\n\nThe expression is f(m!) , which is f of (m factorial), so if f(k)=k, then f(m!) = m!.\n\nAnd f(n)! = (f(n))! = n!.\n\nSo both sides are n! + m!, so indeed divides.\n\nBut is that the only solution? Probably not.\n\nWhat if f is constant? Suppose f(n) = c for all n, some constant c.\n\nThen left side: n! + f(m)! = n! + c!\n\nRight side: f(n)! + f(m!) = c! + c! = 2c!\n\nSo n! + c! divides 2c!.\n\nFor large n, n! is large, while 2c! is fixed, so unless n! + c! \u2264 2c!, but for n large, n! > 2c!, so n! + c! > 2c!, and the only way it divides is if it is equal or smaller, but since it's larger, it can't divide unless equality, but for n large, n! + c! > 2c!, so it doesn't divide unless 2c! is multiple of n! + c!, which is impossible for n large since n! + c! grows without bound.\n\nMore carefully: if n! + c! > 2c!, and since n! + c! is integer greater than 2c!, it cannot divide 2c! because the divisor must be less than or equal to the dividend for positive integers, unless dividend is zero, but it's not.\n\nFor positive integers, if a divides b, and a > b >0, then b/a <1, not integer, contradiction unless b=0, but factorials are at least 1, so no.\n\nSo for constant f, when n is large, n! + c! > 2c!, and cannot divide 2c!.\n\nSo constant functions do not work, except possibly if c is such that n! + c! \u2264 2c! for all n, but for n=1, 1 + c! \u2264 2c!, which is true, but for n=2, 2 + c! \u2264 2c!, so 2 \u2264 c!, so c\u22652, but for n=3, 6 + c! \u2264 2c!, if c=2, 6+2=8 > 4? 2! =2, 2c! =4, 6+2=8>4, no. c=3, c!=6, 2c!=12, 6+6=12\u226412, ok. But for n=4, 24+6=30 >12, not \u226412. So only for small n, but must hold for all n, so no constant function works.\n\nSo identity works, constant doesn't.\n\nWhat about other functions?\n\nPerhaps f(n)=k for all n, but we saw it doesn't work.\n\nOr f(n)=n! or something.\n\nLet me try to find f(1).\n\nSet n=1, m=1.\n\nThen left side: n! + f(m)! =1! + f(1)!\n\nRight side: f(n)! + f(m!) = f(1)! + f(1!) = f(1)! + f(1)\n\nSince m!=1.\n\nSo 1 + f(1)! divides f(1)! + f(1)\n\nLet a = f(1), so 1 + a! divides a! + a.\n\nNow, a! + a = a! + a, and 1 + a!.\n\nSet d = 1 + a!\n\nThen d divides a! + a.\n\nBut a! = (a! + a) - a, so d divides (a! + a), and d = a! +1.\n\nSo (a! +1) divides (a! + a)\n\nSince it divides a! + a, and a! \u2261 -1 mod d, because d = a! +1, so a! \u2261 -1 mod d.\n\nThen a! + a \u2261 -1 + a mod d.\n\nSince d divides a! + a, we have -1 + a \u2261 0 mod d, so a \u2261 1 mod d.\n\nBut d = a! +1, which for a\u22652, a! \u22652, so d\u22653, and a is natural number, so a \u22611 mod d means a -1 is divisible by d.\n\nBut d = a! +1 > a for a\u22652, since a! \u22652 >0, and a! grows faster, but for a\u22652, a! \u22652, d\u22653, and a -1 < a < d for a\u22652? a=2, d=2! +1=3, a-1=1, 1<3, so divisible only if 1=0 mod 3, no.\n\na \u22611 mod d means d divides a-1.\n\nBut if a\u22652, d = a! +1 \u22653, and a-1 \u22651, but d > a-1 for a\u22652.\n\nFor a=1: if a=1, d=1! +1=1+1=2\n\na! + a =1! +1=1+1=2\n\n2 divides 2, ok.\n\nFor a=2, d=2! +1=2+1=3\n\na! +a =2+2=4? f(1)! + f(1) = a! + a =2! +2=2+2=4\n\n3 divides 4? 4 mod 3 =1 \u22600, no.\n\nFor a=3, d=3! +1=6+1=7\n\na! +a=6+3=9\n\n7 divides 9? no.\n\na=4, d=24+1=25, a!+a=24+4=28, 25 does not divide 28.\n\na=5, d=120+1=121, a!+a=120+5=125, 121 does not divide 125.\n\nAnd for larger a, d is much larger than a, and a-1 < d, so only possible if a-1=0, i.e., a=1.\n\nBut when a-1=0, d divides 0, which is true, but d=a!+1, and a-1=0 so a=1, d=1!+1=2, and it divides, as above.\n\nSo only possibility is f(1)=1.\n\nGreat, so f(1)=1.\n\nNow, I need to find f(n) for other n.\n\nNow, with m=1, we have:\n\nFor any n, n! + f(1)! = n! + 1! = n! +1\n\nAnd this divides f(n)! + f(1!) = f(n)! + f(1) = f(n)! +1\n\nSo n! +1 divides f(n)! +1.\n\nThat's a key relation.\n\nSo for all n, n! +1 | f(n)! +1.\n\nSince f(n) is a natural number, and factorials grow fast, this might constrain f(n).\n\nSet k = f(n), so we have n! +1 divides k! +1.\n\nk! +1 is divisible by n! +1.\n\nI recall that k! +1 is divisible by d only if d is prime or something, but not necessarily.\n\nFor example, if n! +1 is prime, then it must divide k! +1, which might imply k is large.\n\nBut n! +1 is not always prime.\n\nThe relation k! \u2261 -1 mod (n! +1)\n\nBut n! +1 is generally large.\n\nI know that for k \u2265 n, k! is divisible by n!, so k! \u2261 0 mod n!.\n\nBut here modulus is n! +1, which is coprime to n!.\n\nIn fact, gcd(n!, n!+1)=1.\n\nNow, k! mod (n! +1).\n\nIf k < n, k! is smaller, but might not be divisible.\n\nI could consider that if k < n, then k! < n! < n! +1, so k! < n! +1, and k! +1 \u2264 k! +1 < n! +1 for k < n? For k \u2264 n-1, k! \u2264 (n-1)! < n! < n! +1, so k! +1 \u2264 (n-1)! +1 < n! for n\u22652, since (n-1)! \u2264 n!/n \u2264 n!/2 for n\u22652, so less than n!, hence less than n!+1.\n\nThus, if k < n, then k! +1 < n! +1, and since both positive, the only way n! +1 divides k! +1 is if k! +1 = n! +1, but then k! = n!, which implies k=n for n\u22651, contradiction if k<n.\n\nk! = n! implies k=n, since factorial is injective for natural numbers.\n\nSo if k < n, k! +1 < n! +1, and not equal, so cannot divide unless k! +1 =0, impossible. So n! +1 does not divide k! +1 if k < n.\n\nTherefore, for the division to hold, we must have k \u2265 n, i.e., f(n) \u2265 n for all n.\n\nIs that right? k = f(n), and k \u2265 n.\n\nFrom above, if k < n, then k! +1 < n! +1, and since n! +1 > k! +1 >0, it cannot divide. So yes, f(n) \u2265 n for all n.\n\nGreat, so f(n) \u2265 n for all natural numbers n.\n\nNow, what about equality? We have identity function, which we saw works.\n\nAre there others?\n\nPerhaps f(n) = n for some, larger for others.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nNow, another point: set m such that m! is large.\n\nI could set n = m.\n\nSet n = m.\n\nThen the condition is:\n\nn! + f(n)! divides f(n)! + f(n!)\n\nBecause left side: n! + f(m)! = n! + f(n)!\n\nRight side: f(n)! + f(m!) = f(n)! + f(n!)\n\nSo n! + f(n)! | f(n)! + f(n!)\n\nSince f(n)! is common, let me set a = n!, b = f(n)!\n\nThen left side is a + b\n\nRight side is b + f(n!)\n\nThe condition is a + b divides b + f(n!)\n\nSince a + b divides b + f(n!), and a + b and b may have common factors, but perhaps I can write that b + f(n!) is divisible by a + b.\n\nSet d = a + b = n! + f(n)!\n\nThen d | b + f(n!)\n\nBut b = f(n)!, so d | f(n)! + f(n!)\n\nNow, f(n!) is some natural number, say c, so d | f(n)! + c\n\nSince d | b + c, and b = f(n)!, so d | f(n)! + f(n!)\n\nNote that f(n)! + f(n!) \u2261 f(n)! + f(n!) mod d\n\nBut d = n! + f(n)!, so modulo d, n! \u2261 -f(n)! mod d\n\nSo f(n)! \u2261 -n! mod d\n\nThus, b + f(n!) \u2261 -n! + f(n!) mod d\n\nBut d divides this, so -n! + f(n!) \u2261 0 mod d, so f(n!) \u2261 n! mod d\n\nThat is, d divides f(n!) - n!\n\nSince d = n! + f(n)!, so n! + f(n)! divides f(n!) - n!\n\nNow, f(n!) - n! could be positive or negative, but since f(k) \u2265 k for all k, as we established earlier, so f(n!) \u2265 n!, so f(n!) - n! \u2265 0.\n\nThus, n! + f(n)! divides f(n!) - n!\n\nSet s = f(n!) - n! \u2265 0\n\nThen n! + f(n)! | s\n\nBut s = f(n!) - n! , and since f(n!) \u2265 n!, s \u2265 0.\n\nNow, the divisor is n! + f(n)! , which is at least n! + n! = 2n! since f(n) \u2265 n, so f(n)! \u2265 n!\n\nThus, divisor d \u2265 2n!\n\nDividend s = f(n!) - n!\n\nNow, since d | s and d > 0, s \u2265 d or s=0.\n\nIf s \u2265 d, then f(n!) - n! \u2265 n! + f(n)!\n\nBut f(n!) \u2265 n!, and f(n)! \u2265 n!, so right side \u2265 2n!, left side f(n!) - n! \u2265 n! only if f(n!) \u2265 2n!, but not necessarily.\n\nf(n!) - n! \u2265 n! + f(n)! \n\nSince f(n)! \u2265 n! >0, right side >0, so left side must be at least d, so f(n!) - n! \u2265 n! + f(n)!\n\nWhich implies f(n!) \u2265 n! + n! + f(n)! = 2n! + f(n)! > f(n)!\n\nBut f(n!) is a natural number, and f(n)! is factorial, so for large n, f(n)! grows very fast if f(n) > n, but f(n!) might not be that large.\n\nThis seems messy.\n\nf(n!) - n! \u2265 n! + f(n)! implies f(n!) \u2265 2n! + f(n)! \n\nBut since f(n)! \u2265 n! , and 2n! + f(n)! \u2265 3n! , so f(n!) \u2265 3n!\n\nBut also, since d | s, and d = n! + f(n)! , s = f(n!) - n! , so s is divisible by d, so |s| \u2265 d unless s=0.\n\nBut s \u22650, so if s >0, then s \u2265 d.\n\nBut s \u2265 d implies f(n!) - n! \u2265 n! + f(n)! , so f(n!) \u2265 2n! + f(n)! \n\nNow, if f(n) > n, then f(n)! is large, so this might force f(n!) to be huge, but perhaps possible, but let's see for small n.\n\nPerhaps s=0 is possible.\n\ns=0 means f(n!) - n! =0, so f(n!) = n!\n\nBut since n! is just a number, and f maps to natural numbers, so for each n, f at n! is n!.\n\nBut n! takes values like 1,2,6,24,etc, not all natural numbers, so f(k) for k not factorial might be different.\n\nBut in this case, if s=0, then f(n!) = n! for all n.\n\nThat might be a possibility.\n\nOtherwise, if s>0, then f(n!) \u2265 2n! + f(n)! \u2265 2n! + n! = 3n! since f(n)\u2265n.\n\nBut f(n!) \u2265 3n!\n\nNow, recall that we also have from earlier that n! +1 | f(n)! +1.\n\nNow, let me try small n to get constraints.\n\nStart with n=1.\n\nWe have f(1)=1.\n\nNow n=2.\n\nf(2) \u22652, and n! +1 =2! +1=3, and it divides f(2)! +1.\n\nSo 3 divides f(2)! +1.\n\nf(2) is some integer \u22652.\n\nIf f(2)=2, then 2! +1=2+1=3, and 3|3? f(2)! +1=2+1=3, yes 3|3.\n\nIf f(2)=3, then f(2)! =6, 6+1=7, 3 divides 7? 7 mod 3=1, no.\n\nf(2)=4, 24+1=25, 25 mod 3=1, not 0.\n\nf(2)=5, 120+1=121, 121 div 3: 120 is 40*40? 3*40=120, so 121-120=1, not divisible.\n\nIn general, f(2)! mod 3: since f(2)\u22652, f(2)! is divisible by 2, but mod 3.\n\nFor k\u22653, k! \u22610 mod 3, since 3|k!.\n\nk! +1 \u22611 mod 3.\n\nBut we need \u22610 mod 3, so k! +1 \u22610 mod 3 only if k! \u22612 mod 3.\n\nBut for k\u22653, k! \u22610 mod 3, so k! +1\u22611 mod 3 \u22600.\n\nFor k=2, 2! =2\u22612, 2+1=3\u22610, good.\n\nFor k=1, but f(2)\u22652>1, so not.\n\nSo only possibility is f(2)=2.\n\nIs that right? k=f(2)\u22652, and k! +1 \u22610 mod 3.\n\nk=2: 2+1=3\u22610.\n\nk=3:6+1=7\u22611\u22600.\n\nk=4:24+1=25\u22611\u22600.\n\nk\u22653 all \u22611 mod 3, since k! divisible by 3.\n\nSo only k=2 works. So f(2)=2.\n\nGreat.\n\nNow n=3.\n\nf(3)\u22653, and n! +1=6+1=7, so 7 divides f(3)! +1.\n\nf(3) is integer \u22653.\n\nCompute k! +1 for k\u22653.\n\nk=3: 6+1=7, 7|7, yes.\n\nk=4:24+1=25, 25 mod 7=25-21=4\u22600.\n\nk=5:120+1=121, 121 /7=17.285? 7*17=119, 121-119=2, so 2\u22600.\n\nk=6:720+1=721, 721 /7=103? 7*100=700, 7*3=21, total 721, yes, 721, 7*103=721, so yes, divisible.\n\nk=7:5040+1=5041, div by 7: 7*720=5040, so 5041-5040=1, not divisible.\n\nk=8:40320+1=40321, div 7: 7*5760=40320, 40321-40320=1, not.\n\nk=9:362880+1=362881, div 7: 7*51840=362880, 362881-362880=1, not.\n\nk=10: huge, but k! for k\u22657 is divisible by 7, since 7 is prime, so k! \u22610 mod 7 for k\u22657, so k!+1\u22611 mod 7 \u22600.\n\nSimilarly, for k=6, we have 720+1=721, which is divisible by 7, as 7*103=721.\n\nk=3:6+1=7, divisible.\n\nk=4:24+1=25, not div by 7.\n\nk=5:120+1=121, 121/7\u224817.285, not integer.\n\nk=6:720+1=721, 721/7=103, yes.\n\nk\u22657: k! \u22610 mod 7, so k!+1\u22611 \u22600 mod 7.\n\nSo possible f(3) are 3 or 6.\n\nNow, we have more conditions.\n\nNow, consider m and n.\n\nSet n=3, m=1.\n\nWe have m=1, f(1)=1, f(1!)=f(1)=1.\n\nLeft side: n! + f(m)! = 6 + f(1)! =6 +1! =6+1=7\n\nRight side: f(n)! + f(m!) = f(3)! + f(1) = f(3)! +1\n\nNow, the condition is that left side divides right side, so 7 divides f(3)! +1, which we already have, so it doesn't give new information since we know it must hold.\n\nSet n=2, m=3.\n\nLeft side: n! + f(m)! = 2! + f(3)! = 2 + f(3)!\n\nRight side: f(n)! + f(m!) = f(2)! + f(3!) = 2! + f(6) = 2 + f(6)  since f(2)=2.\n\nf(2)! = 2! =2.\n\nNow, f(3)! is either 6! if f(3)=6, or 3! =6 if f(3)=3.\n\nf(6) is some natural number, and since f(k)\u2265k, f(6)\u22656.\n\nThe condition is that left side divides right side: 2 + f(3)! divides 2 + f(6)\n\nNow, case 1: f(3)=3, so f(3)! = 3! =6\n\nLeft side: 2 + 6 =8\n\nSo 8 divides 2 + f(6)\n\nThat is, 8 | 2 + f(6), so 2 + f(6) \u22610 mod 8, so f(6) \u2261 -2 \u22616 mod 8.\n\nNow, f(6) \u22656, and f(6) \u22616 mod 8.\n\nCase 2: f(3)=6, so f(3)! =720\n\nLeft side: 2 + 720=722\n\nNow, 722 divides 2 + f(6)\n\nf(6) \u22656, so 2 + f(6) \u22658, but 722 is large, so 722 must divide 2 + f(6), which is at least 8, but 722 >8, so for this to happen, 2 + f(6) must be at least 722, and divisible by 722.\n\nBut since it's divisible, and positive, we must have 2 + f(6) \u2265 722, so f(6) \u2265 720.\n\nNow, but we also have the earlier condition for n=6.\n\nRecall that for any n, f(n!) = n! or something? Earlier we had for each n, when we set m=n, we had s = f(n!) - n! , and d = n! + f(n)! | s, so either s=0 or s \u2265 d.\n\nNow for n=3.\n\nd = n! + f(n)! = 6 + f(3)!\n\ns = f(n!) - n! = f(6) - 6\n\nIf f(3)=3, then d=6 + 6=12\n\ns = f(6) -6\n\nd | s, so 12 | f(6) -6\n\nBut earlier, from n=2,m=3, we have f(6) \u22616 mod 8.\n\nAnd f(6) \u22656.\n\nNow, 12 | f(6) -6, so f(6) \u22616 mod 12.\n\nBut since 12 | f(6)-6, and f(6)\u22616 mod 8.\n\nNow, f(6)\u22616 mod 12 and f(6)\u22616 mod 8.\n\nSince 12 and 8 are not coprime, but 6 mod 12 and 6 mod 8.\n\nThe least common multiple of 12 and 8 is 24.\n\nf(6)\u22616 mod 12, so f(6) = 12a +6 for some a\u22650.\n\nThen 12a+6 \u22616 mod 8? 12a+6 mod 8: 12a\u22614a mod 8, 6\u22616, so 4a+6 \u22616 mod 8, so 4a\u22610 mod 8, so a\u22610 mod 2.\n\nSo a even, a=2b, so f(6)=12*(2b) +6=24b +6.\n\nSo f(6)=24b+6 for some b\u22650.\n\nBut f(6)\u22656, so b\u22650.\n\nNow, also, from the division: we have left side for n=2,m=3 is 8, and it divides 2 + f(6) = 2 + 24b +6 = 24b +8.\n\n8 divides 24b +8? 24b+8 = 8(3b+1), yes, always divisible, for any b.\n\nSo no further restriction.\n\nBut we have s = f(6) -6 = 24b +6 -6=24b\n\nd=12\n\nd|s, 12|24b, yes, always.\n\nBut s=24b, d=12, so if b\u22651, s\u226524>12=d, ok.\n\nBut we need to see if this works with other conditions.\n\nNow, if f(3)=6, then d= n! + f(n)! =6 + 720=726\n\ns= f(6) -6\n\nd|s, so 726 | f(6) -6\n\nAlso, from earlier, left side for n=2,m=3 is 2 + f(3)! =2+720=722\n\nAnd it divides 2 + f(6)\n\nSo 722 | 2 + f(6)\n\nNow, f(6) \u22656, and since 726 | f(6) -6, and 722 | 2 + f(6)\n\nNote that 726 and 722 are both even, but let me see their values.\n\n726 = 2 * 363 = 2 * 3 * 121 = 2 * 3 * 11^2\n\n722 = 2 * 361 = 2 * 19^2\n\nSo gcd might be 2.\n\nf(6) must satisfy f(6) \u22616 mod 726\n\nAnd f(6) \u2261 -2 mod 722, since 722 | 2 + f(6), so f(6) \u2261 -2 mod 722\n\nNow, solve the system:\n\nf(6) \u2261 6 mod 726\n\nf(6) \u2261 -2 \u2261 720 mod 722  (since -2 + 722=720)\n\nNow, 726 and 722, gcd.\n\n726=2*3*11^2, 722=2*19^2, so gcd=2.\n\nNow, 6 mod 2 =0, 720 mod 2=0, so consistent.\n\nNow, use Chinese remainder theorem, but since gcd not 1, need to solve.\n\nSet x = f(6)\n\nx \u2261 6 mod 726\n\nx \u2261 720 mod 722\n\nNow, from first, x=726k +6 for integer k\u22650.\n\nPlug into second: 726k +6 \u2261 720 mod 722\n\nSo 726k \u2261 714 mod 722\n\nNow, 726 - 722=4, so 726\u22614 mod 722\n\n714 - 722? 714 <722, so 714 mod 722=714\n\nSo 4k \u2261 714 mod 722\n\nDivide by 2: 2k \u2261 357 mod 361\n\nSince 722/2=361, and 4k/2=2k, 714/2=357.\n\nNow, gcd(2,361)=1 since 361 odd, so we can solve.\n\n2k \u2261 357 mod 361\n\nNow, 357 mod 361=357, since less.\n\nNow, solve for k: 2k = 361m + 357 for some m.\n\nk = (361m + 357)/2\n\n357 is odd, 361 odd, so 361m +357 odd, not divisible by 2? Contradiction.\n\n361m is odd if m integer, 357 odd, sum even?

But k\u22650? Earlier k is integer, but for k= -2, x=726*(-2)+6= -1452+6= -1446 <0, but f maps to natural numbers, so k\u22650, but k=361t -2, for t\u22651, k\u2265359>0, so f(6)\u2265726*359 +6 >721.\n\nSo indeed, f(6) >721, so f(6)! \u22610 mod 721, so f(6)! +1 not divisible by 721, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the case f(3)=6 is impossible.\n\nThus, only possibility is f(3)=3.\n\nGreat, so f(3)=3.\n\nNow, we have f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=3.\n\nNow, let's find f(4).\n\nFor n=4, we have n! +1=24+1=25, and it must divide f(4)! +1.\n\nf(4)\u22654.\n\nk! +1 divisible by 25.\n\n25 is 5^2, so need k! \u2261 -1 mod 25.\n\nNow, compute factorials mod 25.\n\nk=4: 4! =24\u2261 -1 mod 25? -1 +25=24, yes, 24\u2261 -1, so 24+1=25\u22610, yes.\n\nk=5:5!=120\u2261120-4*25=120-100=20\u2261 -5? 20 mod 25=20, not -1.\n\n20 \u2260 -1 mod 25.\n\nk=6:6!=720. 720 /25=28.8? 25*28=700, 720-700=20, so 20.\n\nk=7:7!=5040, 5040 /25: 25*201=5025, 5040-5025=15.\n\nk=8:8!=40320, /25: 25*1612=40300? 25*1600=40000, 25*12=300, total 40300, 40320-40300=20.\n\nk=9:9!=362880, /25: last two digits 80, 80 div 25? 25*3=75, 80-75=5, so 5.\n\nk=10:10!=3628800, last two digits 00, so divisible by 25, so \u22610.\n\nk=11:11! divisible by 25? 11>5, so yes, \u22610.\n\nFor k\u226510, k! divisible by 25, so k! \u22610 mod 25, so k!+1\u22611 \u22600 mod 25.\n\nk=4:24+1=25\u22610, good.\n\nk=5:120+1=121, 121 /25=4.84, 25*4=100, 121-100=21\u22600.\n\nk=6:720+1=721, 721 /25=28.84, 25*28=700, 721-700=21\u22600.\n\nk=7:5040+1=5041, /25: 25*201=5025, 5041-5025=16\u22600.\n\nk=8:40320+1=40321, /25: 25*1612=40300, 40321-40300=21\u22600?

None seems to be 720. Since we need exactly -1, and k=6 gives it, others don't.\n\nMoreover, for k>6, k! is divisible by higher numbers, but in this case, since 721 is composite, but from computation, no other small k gives it, and for k\u2265103, it's 0.\n\nBut k=102, etc., but k! for k\u2265103 is divisible by 721, as 103 is prime and less than k, and 7< k, so yes.\n\nBut even for k=102, k! is divisible by 7 and 103? 103 is prime, 102<103, so in 102!, the highest prime is 101? 103>102, so 103 does not divide 102!, since 103 prime >102.\n\nSimilarly, 7 is less than 102, so 7 divides 102!, but 103 does not.\n\nNow, 721=7*103, so for k<103, 103 does not divide k!, so k! not divisible by 103, hence not by 721.\n\nTherefore, k! mod 721 is not zero for k<103, but we need it to be -1, i.e., 720.\n\nBut from the computations above, for k=6 to 30, none is 720, and for larger k, say k=102, k! is huge, but modulo 721, since k! for k\u22657 includes 7, but not 103, so it might be possible, but unlikely.\n\nTo check if k! \u2261 -1 mod 721, since 721=7*103, we can check mod 7 and mod 103.\n\nMod 7: for k\u22656, k! \u22610 mod 7, since 7|k!.\n\n-1 \u22616 mod 7.\n\n0 \u22626 mod 7, so for k\u22657, k! \u22610 \u22626 mod 7.\n\nFor k=6, k! =720, 720 /7=102.857? 7*102=714, 720-714=6\u2261 -1 mod 7, yes.\n\nFor k<6, k! not \u2261 -1 mod 7? k=5:120, 120/7=17*7=119, rem 1 \u22606.\n\nk=4:24/7=3*7=21, rem 3\u22606.\n\nk=3:6\u22616? 6\u2261 -1 mod 7? -1+7=6, yes.

Since n! +1 \u22610, so n! \u2261 -1 mod (n! +1), yes.\n\nNow, if k>n, and k < some bound, but as in the cases above, for k>n, k! may not be \u2261 -1 mod (n! +1).\n\nIn particular, if k \u2265 n! +1, then k! is divisible by n! +1, since n! +1 \u2264 k, so k! \u22610 mod (n! +1), so k! +1 \u22611 \u22600 mod (n! +1), unless n! +1=1, impossible.\n\nBut k may be less than n! +1.\n\nHowever, for k>n, k! is divisible by n!, but modulo n! +1, which is coprime to n!.\n\nIn many cases, as above, only k=n satisfies.\n\nBut is it possible that for some n, there is k>n such that k! \u2261 -1 mod (n! +1)?\n\nFor example, n=1, n! +1=2, k! +1 divisible by 2, so k! odd, so k=1, since for k\u22652, k! even.

Earlier we have f(n) < n! +1, so k = f(n) \u2264 n! , since natural number.\n\nf(n) \u2264 n! , since f(n) < n! +1 and integer.\n\nSo k \u2264 n!\n\nThen a = k! / n! \n\nk! / n! = (n+1)(n+2)\\cdots k\n\nSince k \u2265 n+1, this is at least n+1.\n\nk \u2264 n!, so the product has up to n! - n terms, but anyway.\n\na = \\prod_{j=n+1}^k j\n\nWe need a \u22611 mod (n! +1)\n\na is an integer between n+1 and n! ! / n! , but since k \u2264 n!, a \u2264 n! ! / n! = (n! -1)!\n\nBut more importantly, since n! +1 >1, and a \u2265 n+1 >1, and for n\u22653, n! +1 > n+1 \u2265 a? Not necessarily, a could be large.\n\nFor example, if k is large, say k=n!, then a = (n+1)(n+2)\\cdots (n!) \n\nWhich is huge, while modulus n! +1 is smaller? n! +1 < n! * 2 < (n+1) n! for n\u22652, but the product starts from n+1 to n!, so for n\u22653, the product has at least two terms: n+1 and n+2, and n+1 \u22654, n+2\u22655, so a\u226520, while n!+1\u22657, but 20>7, so a could be larger than modulus.\n\nIn fact, for k\u2265n+1, a \u2265 n+1, and for k>n+1, a > n+1.\n\nThe modulus is n! +1, which for n\u22653 is greater than n+1.\n\nWe need a \u22611 mod (n! +1)\n\nSince a is integer, and modulus m = n! +1, if a < m, then a \u22611 mod m implies a=1, but a \u2265 n+1 \u22654 >1, contradiction.\n\nIf a \u2265 m, then a \u22611 mod m means a = q m +1 for some q\u22651.\n\nBut a = \\prod_{j=n+1}^k j\n\nm = n! +1\n\nFor this to hold, but in particular, since the product includes numbers larger than m if k > m, but k \u2264 n!, and m = n! +1, so k \u2264 n! < n! +1 = m, so k < m.\n\nTherefore, all j in the product satisfy n+1 \u2264 j \u2264 k < m, so each j < m.\n\nMoreover, since the product is composed of integers each less than m, and m is prime? Not necessarily.\n\nBut in the product, since each factor is less than m, and m is integer, the product modulo m might be computable, but it's messy.\n\nNote that since each j < m, and m may be composite, but we need the product to be 1 mod m.\n\nBut in particular, if the product includes a multiple of a prime dividing m, but not necessarily.\n\nFor example, n=3, m=7, k=f(3)\u22654, k\u22646.\n\na = \\prod_{j=4}^k j\n\nIf k=4, a=4\n\nNeed 4\u22611 mod 7? 4\u22601.\n\nk=5, a=4*5=20\u22616 mod 7? 20-14=6, 6\u22601.\n\nk=6, a=4*5*6=120\u2261120-17*7=120-119=1? 7*17=119, yes, 120-119=1, so \u22611 mod 7.\n\nOh! For k=6, a=120\u22611 mod 7.\n\nBut earlier for n=3, we had the choice, but it led to contradiction.\n\nIn this case, for f(3)=6, we have a=120\u22611 mod 7, so k! = f(3)! =720, n! =6, so k! \u22610 mod 6? But modulo m=7, we have k! = a * n! =120 * 6=720, and 720 mod 7: 7*102=714, 720-714=6\u2261 -1, yes, as before.\n\nBut earlier we saw that if f(3)=6, it caused problem with f(6).\n\nNow, in general, for n\u22653, if f(n)=n!, then a = \\prod_{j=n+1}^{n!} j = (n+1)(n+2)\\cdots (n!) \n\nNow, this is equal to \\frac{ (n!)! }{ n! }\n\nWe need this \u22611 mod (n! +1)\n\nBut modulo m = n! +1, since n! \u2261 -1 mod m, and (n!)! = 1 \\times 2 \\times \\cdots \\times n! \n\nThe product from 1 to n! is divisible by m? Not necessarily.\n\nIn the case n=3, m=7, (6)! =720\u22616\u2261 -1 mod 7, and n! =6\u2261 -1, so a = 720 / 6 =120 \u22611 mod 7, as above.\n\nBut for other n, it may not be 1.\n\nFor example, n=4.\n\nm = n! +1=24+1=25\n\nIf f(4)=24, then k=24, a= \\prod_{j=5}^{24} j = 5 \\times 6 \\times \\cdots \\times 24 = \\frac{24!}{4!} = \\frac{24!}{24}\n\n24! / 24 = 23!\n\nNow, need 23! \u22611 mod 25.\n\nBut 23! mod 25.\n\nEarlier we computed factorials mod 25.\n\n23! includes 5,10,15,20, so divisible by 100? At least by 25, since multiple 5s.\n\nNumber of 5s: floor(23/5)=4, floor(23/25)=0, so four 5s, so divisible by 625, certainly by 25, so 23! \u22610 mod 25.\n\n0 \u22621 mod 25.\n\nSo not congruent to 1.\n\nThus for n=4, if f(4)=24, a=23! \u22610 \u22601 mod 25.\n\nWhile we need \u22611.\n\nSimilarly, for other k.\n\nIn this case, for f(4), we must have k! \u2261 -1 mod 25, which only k=4 satisfies, as before.\n\nNow, for general n, we need to show that for k > n, k! \\not\u2261 -1 mod (n! +1), except possibly in some cases, but in those cases, it may not satisfy the global condition.\n\nBut to avoid complication, since we have induction, and for each n we can compute, but for the proof, we can state that by the initial conditions and the divisibility, f(n) must be n.\n\nNote that in the expression, when we set n=m, and we have s=0, so f(n!) = n!.\n\nBut we need f(n).\n\nNow, set m such that m! = n.\n\nBut n may not be a factorial.\n\nFor example, for n not factorial, but we have f defined everywhere.\n\nAnother idea: set n=1, m arbitrary.\n\nWe have left side: n! + f(m)! =1 + f(m)!\n\nRight side: f(n)! + f(m!) = f(1)! + f(m!) =1 + f(m!)  since f(1)=1.\n\nSo 1 + f(m)! divides 1 + f(m!)\n\nThat is, f(m)! +1 | f(m!) +1\n\nSince f(m!) \u2265 m! , and f(m)! +1 | f(m!) +1.\n\nIn particular, f(m!) +1 is divisible by f(m)! +1.\n\nSince f(m) \u2265 m, f(m)! +1 is large for large m.\n\nf(m!) \u2265 m! , and f(m!) +1 is divisible by f(m)! +1.\n\nIf f(m) > m, then f(m) \u2265 m+1, so f(m)! \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nThen f(m!) +1 is divisible by f(m)! +1 \u2265 (m+1)! +1\n\nf(m!) \u2264 ? Well, f(m!) is some number, but we have f(k) \u2265 k for all k, so f(m!) \u2265 m! \n\nBut (m+1)! +1 may be larger than m! , but for m large, (m+1)! is much larger than m!.\n\nIn particular, if f(m!) < f(m)! , but f(m!) \u2265 m! , and f(m)! \u2265 (m+1)! for f(m)\u2265m+1, and (m+1)! > m! for m\u22651, so f(m)! > f(m!) if f(m)\u2265m+1? Not necessarily, f(m!) could be large.\n\nBut the divisor f(m)! +1 is at least (m+1)! +1, and the dividend f(m!) +1 \u2265 m! +1.\n\nSince divisor may be larger than dividend, but only if equal.\n\nSpecifically, if (m+1)! +1 > m! +1, which is true for m\u22651, and if f(m!) < (m+1)! , then f(m!) +1 \u2264 (m+1)! < (m+1)! +1 \u2264 f(m)! +1, so if strict inequality, dividend < divisor, so cannot divide unless dividend =0, impossible.\n\nThus, we must have f(m!) \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nBut f(m!) \u2265 m! , but now \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nMoreover, since f(m)! +1 | f(m!) +1, and f(m!) +1 \u2265 (m+1)! +1\n\nNow, by induction, if we assume that for k < m, f(k)=k, but m! may be large.\n\nNote that f(m!) \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nBut (m+1)! = (m+1) m! \n\nNow, also, from earlier, for the point j = m!, we have j! +1 | f(j)! +1, that is, (m!)! +1 | f(m!)! +1\n\nf(m!) \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nf(m!)! is factorial of f(m!), which is huge.\n\nIf f(m!) \u2265 (m!)! +1, then f(m!)! \u22610 mod ((m!)! +1), so f(m!)! +1 \u22611 \u22600, contradiction.\n\nSo we must have f(m!) < (m!)! +1\n\nBut f(m!) \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nFor m\u22652, (m+1)! < (m!)! +1, since (m!)! is much larger.\n\nNow, f(m!) is at least (m+1)! and less than (m!)! +1.\n\nBut we have that f(m!) +1 is divisible by f(m)! +1.\n\nf(m) is at least m+1, so f(m)! \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nSet d = f(m)! +1 \u2265 (m+1)! +1\n\nThen d | f(m!) +1\n\nf(m!) +1 \u2265 (m+1)! +1 = d? f(m!) \u2265 (m+1)! , so f(m!) +1 \u2265 (m+1)! +1 = d\n\nEquality if f(m!) = (m+1)! \n\nOtherwise greater.\n\nSince d | f(m!) +1 and f(m!) +1 \u2265 d, equality must hold, because if strict, then f(m!) +1 > d, but d divides it, so f(m!) +1 \u2265 2d, but d is large.\n\nMore carefully: since d | f(m!) +1, and f(m!) +1 \u2265 d, then f(m!) +1 = q d for some q\u22651.\n\nIf q=1, then f(m!) +1 = d = f(m)! +1, so f(m!) = f(m)!\n\nSince factorials are equal, and f maps to natural numbers, we must have f(m!) = f(m) , but f(m!) is at the point m!, while f(m) is at m, different points.\n\nf(m!) and f(m) are values, so f(m!) = f(m)! \n\nBut f(m)! is factorial of f(m), so f(m!) = f(m)!\n\nSince factorials are injective for natural numbers greater than 1, but f(m!) and f(m)! are both factorials if they are integers, but f(m!) is a number, and f(m)! is factorial of f(m).\n\nSet a = f(m), b = f(m!)\n\nThen b = a! \n\nBecause f(m!) = f(m)! , so b = a! \n\na = f(m) \u2265 m+1\n\nb = f(m!) \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nBut b = a! , so a! = b \u2265 (m+1)! \n\nSince a \u2265 m+1, a! \u2265 (m+1)! , equality if a=m+1.\n\nIf a > m+1, then a! > (m+1)! , since a \u2265 m+2, a! \u2265 (m+2)! > (m+1)!\n\nBut we have b = a! \u2265 (m+1)! , which is satisfied.\n\nBut also, we have the earlier condition that f(k) \u2265 k for all k, so in particular, at k=m, f(m)=a \u2265 m+1\n\nAt k=m!, f(m!)=b = a! \n\nBy the same condition for k=m!, f(m!) \u2265 m! \n\nWhich is true since b = a! \u2265 (m+1)! > m! for m\u22652.\n\nBut now, we need to see if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nBut earlier for m=3, if f(3)>3, say f(3)=4, but earlier we saw for n=3, f(3) must be 3 or 6, not 4.\n\nSuppose for some m, f(m)=m+1.\n\nThen b = f(m!) = f(m)! = (m+1)!\n\nNow, but we also have from setting n=m, we had that if s=0, f(m!)=m!, but here b=(m+1)! > m! for m\u22651, so not equal.\n\nBut earlier for each n, we have that f(n!) must be n!, because when we set m=n in the beginning, we had that either f(n!)=n! or f(n!) \u2265 3n! , but the latter led to contradiction, so f(n!)=n! for all n.\n\nIn particular, f(m!) = m!\n\nBut if f(m)=m+1, then f(m!) = (m+1)! , so we must have (m+1)! = m!\n\nWhich implies m+1 = m, impossible.\n\nTherefore, contradiction.\n\nSo if f(m) > m, then we have f(m!) = f(m)! \n\nBut we also have f(m!) = m! , from the earlier conclusion.\n\nThus m! = f(m)! \n\nSince factorials are injective, m! = k! implies m=k.\n\nThus f(m) = m.\n\nBut we assumed f(m) > m, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, f(m) = m for all m.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFrom earlier, we concluded that for each n, f(n!) = n!.\n\nNow, if f(m) > m, then from above, with n=m, we have f(m!) = f(m)! \n\nBut f(m!) = m! , so m! = f(m)! \n\nThus f(m) = m, contradiction to f(m) > m.\n\nTherefore, f(m) = m for all m.\n\nSo the only solution is the identity function.\n\nNow, we need to verify that it satisfies the original equation.\n\nWe did at the beginning: if f(n)=n for all n, then left side n! + f(m)! = n! + m!\n\nRight side f(n)! + f(m!) = n! + (m!)! ? No.\n\nf(m!) = m! , since f(k)=k, so f(m!) = m!\n\nThus right side f(n)! + f(m!) = n! + m!\n\nSame as left side, so it divides.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, are there any other solutions? From the above, no.\n\nBut earlier for n=3, f(3)=6 was a candidate for the divisibility, but it didn't work globally.\n\nSimilarly, in this proof, we see that f(n!) must be n!, and if f(m)>m, it forces contradiction.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus the only function is the identity.\n\nSo the answer is \\( f(n) = n \\) for all n.\n\nBut let me confirm for n=1,2,3, as we did.\n\nAnd for m=n=1: left side 1! + f(1)! =1+1=2\n\nRight side f(1)! + f(1!) =1! + f(1)=1+1=2, 2|2.\n\nm=2,n=1: left 1! + f(2)! =1 + 2! =1+2=3? f(2)! =2!=2.\n\nRight f(1)! + f(2!) =1! + f(2)=1+2=3, 3|3.\n\nm=2,n=2: left 2! + f(2)! =2+2=4\n\nRight f(2)! + f(2!) =2! + f(2)=2+2=4, 4|4.\n\nm=3,n=1: left 1! + f(3)! =1+6=7\n\nRight f(1)! + f(3!) =1! + f(6)=1+6=7, 7|7. Assuming f(6)=6.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the proof is complete.\n",

Let's test this possibility.\nThe function would be \\(f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=6\\), and \\(f(n)=n\\) for \\(n \\ge 4\\) (this is suggested by the analysis for \\(n=4\\), and we can assume it for now for other \\(n\\)).\nLet \\(m=2, n=3\\).\nThen \\(n!+f(m)! = 3!+f(2)! = 6+2! = 6+2=8\\).\nAnd \\(f(n)!+f(m!) = f(3)!+f(2!) = 6!+f(2) = 720+2=722\\).\nThe condition is \\(8 \\mid 722\\).\n\\(722 = 8 \\times 90 + 2\\). This is false.\nSo \\(f(3)=6\\) is not possible if \\(f(2)=2\\).\nSince we proved \\(f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(4)=4\\), the possibility \\(f(3)=6\\) is ruled out.\nTherefore, \\(f(3)\\) must be \\(3\\).\n\nThis line of reasoning suggests that \\(f(n)=n\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) is the only candidate function that can satisfy the derived condition \\(n!+1 \\mid f(n)!-n!\\) along with \\(f(1)=1\\).\n\nStep 5: Test \\(f(n)=n\\) in the original equation.\nIf \\(f(n)=n\\) for all \\(n\\), the original assertion becomes:\n\\(n!+m! \\mid n!+(m!)!\\) for all \\(m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\nSince \\(n!+m!\\) divides itself, it must divide the difference \\((n!+(m!)!) - (n!+m!)\\).\nSo, \\(n!+m! \\mid (m!)!-m!\\).\nThis must hold for all \\(m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\nLet \\(m=3\\). Then \\((m!)!-m! = (3!)!-3! = 6!-6 = 720-6=714\\).\nSo we need \\(n!+3! \\mid 714\\), i.e., \\(n!+6 \\mid 714\\).\nThis must hold for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\nLet \\(n=1: 1!+6 = 7\\). \\(7 \\mid 714\\) since \\(714 = 7 \\times 102\\). True.\nLet \\(n=2: 2!+6 = 8\\). \\(8 \\mid 714\\). \\(714 = 8 \\times 89 + 2\\). False.\nLet \\(n=3: 3!+6 = 12\\). \\(12 \\mid 714\\). \\(714 = 12 \\times 59 + 6\\). False.\nLet \\(n=4: 4!+6 = 24+6 = 30\\). \\(30 \\mid 714\\). False (714 is not a multiple of 10).\nLet \\(n=5: 5!+6 = 120+6 = 126\\). \\(126 \\mid 714\\). \\(714 = 126 \\times 5 + 84\\). False.\nLet \\(n=6: 6!+6 = 720+6 = 726\\). We need \\(726 \\mid 714\\). Since \\(726 > 714\\) and \\(714 \\ne 0\\), this is false.\nSince \\(f(n)=n\\) fails for \\(m=3, n=2\\), it is not a solution.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion.\nThe derivation in Steps 1-4 showed that if a function \\(f\\) satisfies the given conditions, it must be \\(f(n)=n\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\nHowever, Step 5 showed that \\(f(n)=n\\) is not a solution.\nThis means that there are no functions \\(f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) satisfying the given condition.\n\nLet's double check the argument that \\(f(n)=n\\) for all \\(n\\).\nThe argument for \\(f(n)=n\\) for \\(n=1,2,4\\) is sound.\nThe argument for \\(f(3)=3\\) relied on testing \\(f(3)=6\\) with \\(P(2,3)\\). With \\(f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=6\\).\nLHS: \\(n!+f(m)! = 3!+f(2)! = 6+2=8\\).\nRHS: \\(f(n)!+f(m!) = f(3)!+f(2!) = 6!+f(2) = 720+2=722\\).\nThe condition \\(8 \\mid 722\\) is false. This relies only on \\(f(2)=2\\) and \\(f(3)=6\\). This is correct.\nSo \\(f(3)=3\\).\nThe argument that \\(f(n)=n\\) for \\(n \\ge N\\), specifically for \\(f(n) < n!+1\\):\nIf \\(f(n) \\ge n!+1\\), then \\(n!+1 \\mid f(n)!-n!\\) implies \\(n!+1 \\mid 1\\), which is impossible for \\(n>0\\).\nSo \\(f(n) < n!+1\\).\nFor \\(n=5\\), \\(f(5) < 5!+1 = 121\\).\nCondition is \\(121 \\mid f(5)!-120\\).\nIf \\(f(5) \\ne 5\\), then \\(f(5) \\ge 5+2=7\\).\nIf \\(f(5) \\ge 22\\), then \\(f(5)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{121}\\) (since \\(11, 22\\) are factors in \\(f(5)!\\)).\nThen \\(121 \\mid -120\\), which implies \\(121 \\mid 1\\). Impossible.\nSo \\(f(5) < 22\\).\nWe need to check \\(f(5) \\in \\{7, \\dots, 21\\}\\).\nIf there is an \\(f(5)\\) in this range such that \\(121 \\mid f(5)!-120\\), then \\(f(5)\\) could be non-standard.\nExample: \\(f(5)=7 \\implies 121 \\mid 7!-120 = 5040-120=4920\\). \\(4920 = 40 \\times 121 + 80\\). No.\n\\(f(5)=10 \\implies 121 \\mid 10!-120 = 3628800-120 = 3628680\\). \\(3628680 = 29989 \\times 121 + 11\\). No.\n\\(f(5)=11 \\implies 121 \\mid 11!-120\\). \\(11! = 11 \\times 10!\\). \\(11!-120 \\equiv -120 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}\\). No.\nThis general argument seems correct. For \\(f(n) \\ge k_p(n!+1)\\) where \\(k_p(n!+1)\\) is the number required for \\((n!+1)\\) to divide \\(f(n)!\\). Usually \\(k_p(X)=X\\) if X is prime, or first multiple of X.\nThe argument that \\(f(n)=n\\) for all \\(n\\) appears to be correct.\n\nThe problem states to find all functions. If no such functions exist, the answer is \"no such functions exist\".\n\nFinal verification:\n1. \\(f(1)=1\\). Correct.\n2. \\(n!+1 \\mid f(n)!-n!\\) for all \\(n\\). Correct.\n3. \\(f(n) \\ge n\\) for all \\(n\\). Correct.\n4. \\(f(n) \\ne n+1\\) for all \\(n\\). Correct.\n5. For each \\(n\\), either \\(f(n)=n\\) or \\(f(n) \\ge n+2\\). Correct.\n6. For each \\(n\\), if \\(f(n) \\ne n\\), then \\(f(n) < n!+1\\). Correct.\n7. Specific checks: \\(f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3) \\in \\{3,6\\}, f(4)=4\\). Correct.\n8. Test \\(f(3)=6\\): If \\(f(3)=6\\), then assuming \\(f(2)=2\\), we use \\(P(2,3)\\): \\(3!+f(2)! \\mid f(3)!+f(2!)\\). This is \\(3!+2! \\mid 6!+2!\\) because \\(f(2)=2 \\implies f(2!)=f(2)=2\\). So \\(6+2 \\mid 720+2 \\implies 8 \\mid 722\\). This is false. So \\(f(3)\\) must be \\(3\\).\nThis confirms that \\(f(n)=n\\) is the only function satisfying the conditions derived from \\(P(m,n)\\) by setting one variable to 1.\nThen, \\(f(n)=n\\) is tested against the full statement of \\(P(m,n)\\) and fails.\nThe logic is sound.\n\nConclusion: There are no functions \\(f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) satisfying the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{No solution}$.",

            "solution": "To solve the problem of finding all functions $ f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} $ such that\n\n$$\nn! + f(m)! \\mid f(n)! + f(m!)\n$$\n\nfor all $ m, n \\in \\mathbb{N} $, we proceed by analyzing the implications of this divisibility condition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Divisibility Condition\n\nWe are given that for all $ m, n \\in \\mathbb{N} $, the expression $ n! + f(m)! $ divides $ f(n)! + f(m!) $. This implies that there exists some integer $ k \\in \\mathbb{N} $ such that\n\n$$\nf(n)! + f(m!) = k(n! + f(m)!).\n$$\n\nThis must hold for **all** $ m, n \\in \\mathbb{N} $, which gives us a strong constraint on the function $ f $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Special Case $ m = 1 $\n\nLet\u2019s plug in $ m = 1 $. Then the condition becomes:\n\n$$\nn! + f(1)! \\mid f(n)! + f(1).\n$$\n\nLet $ c = f(1) $. Then this becomes:\n\n$$\nn! + c! \\mid f(n)! + c.\n$$\n\nThis tells us that $ f(n)! + c $ is divisible by $ n! + c! $, which gives us a strong constraint on the growth of $ f(n)! $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Special Case $ n = 1 $\n\nNow plug in $ n = 1 $. The condition becomes:\n\n$$\n1! + f(m)! \\mid f(1)! + f(m!).\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n1 + f(m)! \\mid c! + f(m!),\n$$\n\nwhere $ c = f(1) $. This tells us that $ 1 + f(m)! \\mid c! - 1 $, since:\n\n$$\nc! + f(m!) - (1 + f(m)! ) = c! - 1.\n$$\n\nSo, $ 1 + f(m)! \\mid c! - 1 $ for all $ m \\in \\mathbb{N} $. Since $ c! - 1 $ is a fixed number, this implies that $ 1 + f(m)! $ must divide a fixed integer. However, $ 1 + f(m)! $ grows with $ f(m) $, which would eventually exceed $ c! - 1 $ unless $ f(m) $ is bounded.\n\nThis contradiction implies that $ c! - 1 = 0 $, i.e., $ c = 1 $, since $ c \\in \\mathbb{N} $.\n\nSo, we conclude:\n\n$$\nf(1) = 1.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Back to the Case $ m = 1 $\n\nNow that we know $ f(1) = 1 $, the condition becomes:\n\n$$\nn! + 1 \\mid f(n)! + 1.\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s denote $ A = n! $, so we have:\n\n$$\nA + 1 \\mid f(n)! + 1.\n$$\n\nThis implies that $ f(n)! + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{A + 1} $, or equivalently:\n\n$$\nf(n)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n! + 1}.\n$$\n\nThis is a strong condition. In particular, if we write $ f(n)! = k(n! + 1) - 1 $, then $ f(n)! + 1 = k(n! + 1) $, which is divisible by $ n! + 1 $, as required.\n\nHowever, we can analyze this more precisely.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Special Case $ m = n $\n\nLet\u2019s now plug in $ m = n $. The condition becomes:\n\n$$\nn! + f(n)! \\mid f(n)! + f(n!).\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\nn! + f(n)! \\mid f(n)! + f(n!).\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s denote $ B = f(n)! $, so the condition becomes:\n\n$$\nn! + B \\mid B + f(n!).\n$$\n\nThis implies:\n\n$$\nn! + B \\mid f(n!) - n!.\n$$\n\nSince $ n! + B > n! $, this can only happen if $ f(n!) = n! $, or else the right-hand side is not divisible by the left-hand side.\n\nTherefore, we conclude:\n\n$$\nf(n!) = n! \\quad \\text{for all } n \\in \\mathbb{N}.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Using the Identity on Factorials\n\nFrom the above, we know that $ f(n!) = n! $. Now, since $ f $ is a function from $ \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} $, and $ n! $ is injective (i.e., $ a! = b! \\Rightarrow a = b $ for $ a, b \\in \\mathbb{N} $), this implies that:\n\n$$\nf(n) = n \\quad \\text{for all } n \\in \\mathbb{N}.\n$$\n\nThis is because if $ f(n) = k $, then $ f(n!) = k! $, and since $ f(n!) = n! $, we must have $ k! = n! $, which implies $ k = n $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Solution\n\nLet\u2019s verify that the function $ f(n) = n $ satisfies the original condition.\n\nWe need to check that:\n\n$$\nn! + m! \\mid n! + m!\n$$\n\nwhich is trivially true, since any number divides itself.\n\nThus, the function $ f(n) = n $ satisfies the condition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Uniqueness\n\nWe have shown that any function $ f $ satisfying the condition must satisfy $ f(n!) = n! $, and since $ f(n)! = n! $, it follows that $ f(n) = n $.\n\nTherefore, the only such function is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{f(n) = n}\n$$",

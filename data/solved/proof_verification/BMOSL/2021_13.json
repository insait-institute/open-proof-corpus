            "solution": "Solution 1. The answer is $c=\\frac{1000}{91}=11-\\frac{11}{1001}$. Clearly, if $c^{\\prime}$ works, so does any $c>c^{\\prime}$. First we prove that $c=11-\\frac{11}{1001}$ is good.\n\nWe start with $100$ empty boxes. First, we consider only the coins that individually value more than $\\frac{1000}{1001}$. As their sum cannot overpass 1000, we deduce that there are at most $1000$ such coins. Thus we are able to put (at most) $10$ such coins in each of the $100$ boxes. Everything so far is all right: $10 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{1001}<10<c=11-\\frac{11}{1001}$.\n\nNext, step by step, we take one of the remaining coins and prove there is a box where it can be added. Suppose that at some point this algorithm fails. It would mean that at a certain point the total sums in the $100$ boxes would be $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{100}$ and no matter how we would add the coin $x$, where $x \\leqslant \\frac{1000}{1001}$, in any of the boxes, that box would be overflowed, i.e., it would have a total sum of more than $11-\\frac{11}{1001}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nx_{i}+x>11-\\frac{11}{1001}\n$$\nfor all $i=1,2, \\ldots, 100$. Then\n$$\nx_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{100}+100 x>100 \\cdot\\left(11-\\frac{11}{1001}\\right) .\n$$\n\nBut since $1000 \\geqslant x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{100}+x$ and $\\frac{1000}{1001} \\geqslant x$ we obtain the contradiction\n\n$$\n1000+99 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{1001}>100 \\cdot\\left(11-\\frac{11}{1001}\\right) \\Longleftrightarrow 1000 \\cdot \\frac{1100}{1001}>100 \\cdot 11 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{1001} .\n$$\n\nThus the algorithm does not fail and since we have finitely many coins, we will eventually reach to a happy end.\n\nNow we show that $c=11-11 \\alpha$, with $1>\\alpha>\\frac{1}{1001}$ does not work.\nTake $r \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{1001}, \\alpha\\right)$ and let $n=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{1-r}\\right\\rfloor$. Since $r \\geqslant \\frac{1}{1001}$, then $\\frac{1000}{1-r} \\geqslant 1001$, therefore $n \\geqslant 1001$.\nNow take $n$ coins each of value $1-r$. Their sum is $n(1-r) \\leqslant \\frac{1000}{1-r} \\cdot(1-r)=1000$. Now, no matter how we place them in $100$ boxes, as $n \\geqslant 1001$, there exist $11$ coins in the same box. But $11(1-r)=11-11 r>11-11 \\alpha$, so the constant $c=11-11 \\alpha$ indeed does not work.\n\nSolution $2$ (for the upper bound). Amongst all possible arrangements into boxes, pick one where the maximum value inside a box is as small as possible. If there are several arrangements achieving this smallest maximum value, pick one where the number of boxes achieving this value is as small as possible.\n\nSay that the boxes have total values equal to $10+x_{1} \\geqslant 10+x_{2} \\geqslant \\cdots \\geqslant 10+x_{100}$. respectively. We must have $x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{100} \\leqslant 0$. In particular, $0 \\geqslant x_{1}+99 x_{100}$.\n\nAssume for contradiction that $x_{1}>\\frac{990}{1001}=\\frac{90}{91}$. Remove the coin of smallest denomination from the first box and add it into the 100-th box. Since the total value in the first box is greater than 10, the first box has at least $11$ coins and therefore it has a coin of value at most $\\frac{10+x_{1}}{11}$. The total new value in the last box is at most\n\n$$\n10+x_{100}+\\frac{10+x_{1}}{11} \\leqslant 10-\\frac{x_{1}}{99}+\\frac{10+x_{1}}{11}=10+x_{1}+\\frac{90-91 x_{1}}{99}<10+x_{1}\n$$\n\nRemark. If we replace $[0,1]$ with $[0, v]$, the total sum with $s$, and the number of available boxes with $n$, then the answer to the problem is\n\n$$\nc=v+\\frac{s}{n}-\\left(\\frac{s}{n}+1\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s+1}=v+\\frac{s^{2}-n}{n(s+1)}\n$$",

            "solution": "Let $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N$ be the values of the $N$ coins. We are given that $x_i \\in [0,1]$ for all $i$.\nLet $S = \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$ be the total value of the coins. We are given $S \\le 1000$.\nWe need to split these coins into $M=100$ boxes. Let $S_j$ be the total value of coins in box $B_j$.\nWe are looking for the smallest constant $c > 0$ such that there always exists a partition of coins into $M$ boxes with $S_j \\le c$ for all $j=1, \\dots, M$.\nLet $L(I)$ denote the makespan of a partition for a given set of coins $I=\\{x_1, \\dots, x_N\\}$, i.e. $L(I) = \\max_j S_j$.\nLet $L^*(I)$ be the minimum possible makespan over all possible partitions for the set $I$.\nThe problem asks for the smallest $c$ such that for any set of coins $I$ (satisfying the conditions $S \\le 1000$ and $x_i \\in [0,1]$), $L^*(I) \\le c$.\nThis means $c = \\sup_I L^*(I)$, where the supremum is taken over all valid sets of coins $I$.\n\nPart 1: Finding an upper bound for $c$.\nThe List Scheduling (LS) algorithm is a simple greedy algorithm for this problem: process the coins one by one, in any order. For each coin, place it into the box that currently has the smallest sum of coin values.\nLet $L_{LS}(I)$ be the makespan achieved by the LS algorithm for a set of coins $I$.\nA classical result by R. Graham (1966) states that $L_{LS}(I) \\le \\frac{S}{M} + \\frac{M-1}{M} x_{\\max}(I)$, where $x_{\\max}(I) = \\max_i x_i$ is the maximum value of a coin in the set $I$.\n(The proof sketch: Let $S_k$ be the sum in the box with the maximum load. Let $x_L$ be the last coin placed in this box $B_k$. Let $S_k'$ be the load of $B_k$ just before $x_L$ was added. So $S_k = S_k' + x_L$. When $x_L$ was placed in $B_k$, $B_k$ must have had the minimum load, i.e. $S_k' \\le S_j'$ for all other boxes $B_j$ (where $S_j'$ is the load of $B_j$ at that time). This implies $S_k' \\le S_j$ for all $j \\ne k$, because $S_j \\ge S_j'$. Therefore $S = \\sum_{j=1}^M S_j \\ge S_k + \\sum_{j \\ne k} S_j \\ge (S_k' + x_L) + (M-1)S_k'$. Thus $S \\ge M S_k' + x_L$, which implies $S_k' \\le \\frac{S-x_L}{M}$. So $S_k = S_k' + x_L \\le \\frac{S-x_L}{M} + x_L = \\frac{S}{M} + \\frac{M-1}{M}x_L$. Since $x_L \\le x_{\\max}(I)$, we have $S_k \\le \\frac{S}{M} + \\frac{M-1}{M}x_{\\max}(I)$.)\n\nFor any set of coins $I$, an optimal partition $L^*(I)$ must be less than or equal to the partition value given by the LS algorithm, $L^*(I) \\le L_{LS}(I)$.\nSo, for any $I$:\n$L^*(I) \\le \\frac{S}{M} + \\frac{M-1}{M} x_{\\max}(I)$.\nWe are given $S \\le 1000$, $M=100$, and $x_i \\in [0,1]$ (so $x_{\\max}(I) \\le 1$).\nTherefore, $L^*(I) \\le \\frac{1000}{100} + \\frac{100-1}{100} \\cdot 1 = 10 + \\frac{99}{100} \\cdot 1 = 10 + 0.99 = 10.99$.\nThis means that for any set of coins $I$ meeting the conditions, the optimal makespan is at most $10.99$.\nThus, $c = \\sup_I L^*(I) \\le 10.99$.\n\nPart 2: Showing $c$ can be arbitrarily close to $10.99$.\nWe need to show that $c \\ge 10.99$. This requires finding a sequence of coin sets $I_k$ such that $L^*(I_k)$ approaches $10.99$, or a single set $I_0$ for which $L^*(I_0)=10.99$.\nConsider a specific family of coin sets, $I_k$, for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}^+$.\nEach set $I_k$ consists of:\n1. $N_L=1$ large coin of value $x_L = 1$.\n2. $N_s = M(M-1)k = 100 \\cdot 99 \\cdot k = 9900k$ small coins, each of value $x_s = \\frac{1}{Mk} = \\frac{1}{100k}$. (Note: $x_s \\le 1$ is satisfied for $k \\ge 1/100$, so for integer $k \\ge 1$).\n\nThe total value of these small coins is $S_{small} = N_s x_s = (9900k) \\cdot \\frac{1}{100k} = \\frac{9900}{100} = 99$.\nThe total value of all coins in $I_k$ is $S = S_{small} + x_L = 99 + 1 = 100$.\nThis $S=100$ is $\\le 1000$. All coin values $x_s, x_L$ are in $[0,1]$. So $I_k$ is a valid set of coins.\n(Note: we selected $x_s$ such that $(M-1)x_s = (99/100k)$. We want the sum of small coins in each box to be $(M-1)x_s \\cdot M \\epsilon'$, or something like that. Let's adjust the construction.)\n\nLet's use the standard example that shows the LS bound is tight.\nLet $k$ be a large positive integer.\nConsider an instance $I_k$ consisting of:\n1. $N_s = M(M-1)k = 100 \\cdot 99 \\cdot k = 9900k$ \"small\" coins, each of value $x_s = \\frac{1}{k} \\frac{9.99}{99} = \\frac{0.100909...}{k}$. We must ensure $x_s \\le 1$. This is true for $k \\ge 1$. For $k$ very large, $x_s$ becomes very small. Let's simplify and choose $x_s$ to be a convenient fraction that is small. Let $x_s = \\frac{1}{100k}$.\n$N_s = 9900k$ coins of value $x_s = \\frac{A}{k}$ for some $A$.\nThe sum of small coins $S_{small} = N_s x_s = M(M-1)k \\cdot x_s$. We want $S_{small}=999$.\nSo $9900k \\cdot x_s = 999 \\implies x_s = \\frac{999}{9900k} = \\frac{111}{1100k}$. This value is $\\le 1$ for $k \\ge 1$.\nSo, let $I_k$ be the set of $N_s = 9900k$ coins of value $x_s = \\frac{111}{1100k}$ and one large coin $x_L=1$.\nThe total sum is $S = N_s x_s + x_L = 999+1=1000$. All coins are in $[0,1]$.\n\nConsider this set $I_k$. Let $V_j$ be the sum of small coins in box $B_j$. All $V_j$ must be integer multiples of $x_s$.\nThe total sum of small coins is $\\sum V_j = 999$.\nLet the large coin $x_L=1$ be placed in box $B_1$. So $S_1=V_1+1$, and $S_j=V_j$ for $j=2, \\dots, M$.\nThe makespan is $L(I_k) = \\max(V_1+1, V_2, \\dots, V_M)$. We want to minimize this value to find $L^*(I_k)$.\nSuppose $L^*(I_k) < 10.99$.\nThen $V_1+1 < 10.99 \\implies V_1 < 9.99$.\nSince $V_1$ is a sum of $x_s$ coins, $V_1 = n_1 x_s$ for some integer $n_1$.\n$n_1 x_s < 9.99 \\implies n_1 \\frac{111}{1100k} < \\frac{999}{100} \\implies n_1 < \\frac{999}{100} \\frac{1100k}{111} = \\frac{999}{111} \\frac{1100k}{100} = 9 \\cdot 11k = 99k$.\nSo $n_1 \\le 99k-1$. Thus $V_1 \\le (99k-1)x_s = (99k-1)\\frac{111}{1100k} = 9.99 - x_s$.\nThe sum of small coins in other boxes is $\\sum_{j=2}^M V_j = 999 - V_1 \\ge 999 - (9.99-x_s) = 989.01+x_s$.\nThere are $M-1=99$ such boxes. The average sum in these boxes is $\\frac{989.01+x_s}{99} = \\frac{989.01}{99} + \\frac{x_s}{99} = 9.99 + \\frac{x_s}{99}$.\nSo there must be at least one box $B_j$ (for $j \\ge 2$) such that $V_j \\ge 9.99 + \\frac{x_s}{99}$.\nSince $V_j$ must be an integer multiple of $x_s$, say $V_j=n_j x_s$:\n$n_j x_s \\ge 9.99 + \\frac{x_s}{99}$. Since $9.99 = (99k)x_s = 99k \\frac{111}{1100k}$,\n$n_j x_s \\ge 99k x_s + \\frac{x_s}{99}$. So $n_j \\ge 99k + \\frac{1}{99}$.\nThis implies $n_j \\ge 99k+1$. (Since $n_j$ must be an integer).\nSo $V_j \\ge (99k+1)x_s = 9.99+x_s$.\nThus, if we try to make $V_1+1 < 10.99$ (by making $V_1 \\le 9.99-x_s$), then some other $V_j$ becomes $\\ge 9.99+x_s$.\nThe makespan for such a partition would be $\\max(V_1+1, V_j) \\ge \\max( (9.99-x_s)+1, 9.99+x_s ) = \\max(10.99-x_s, 9.99+x_s)$.\nFor $x_s$ small (i.e. $k$ large), $10.99-x_s > 9.99+x_s$. For example, if $x_s < 1$, then $10.99-x_s > 9.99+x_s$. Our $x_s = \\frac{111}{1100k}$ is $\\le \\frac{111}{1100} < 0.11$ for $k \\ge 1$. So $10.99-x_s > 9.99+x_s$.\nThis means the makespan is at least $10.99-x_s$.\nThis construction leads to an optimal makespan for $I_k$ of $L^*(I_k) = 10.99-x_s$. For example, we can set:\nBox $B_1$: $n_1 = 99k-1$ small coins. $V_1=(99k-1)x_s = 9.99-x_s$. So $S_1=10.99-x_s$.\nBox $B_2$: $n_2 = 99k+1$ small coins. $V_2=(99k+1)x_s = 9.99+x_s$. So $S_2=9.99+x_s$.\nThe remaining $N_s - (n_1+n_2) = 9900k - (99k-1+99k+1) = 9900k - 198k = 9702k$ small coins are distributed among $M-2=98$ boxes.\nThe sum of these coins is $9702k \\cdot x_s = 999 - (9.99-x_s) - (9.99+x_s) = 999 - 2 \\cdot 9.99 = 999 - 19.98 = 979.02$.\nAverage number of coins in these $98$ boxes is $9702k/98 = 99k$. So each of these boxes gets $99k$ coins, sum $99k x_s = 9.99$.\nThe sums in the boxes are $\\{10.99-x_s, 9.99+x_s, 9.99, \\dots, 9.99\\}$.\nThe maximum sum is $10.99-x_s$. (This is for $k \\ge 1$, $x_s=\\frac{111}{1100k} \\le \\frac{111}{1100} \\approx 0.1$. Then $10.99-x_s > 9.99+x_s$ is true).\nSo $L^*(I_k) = 10.99-x_s = 10.99 - \\frac{111}{1100k}$.\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, $x_s \\to 0$, and $L^*(I_k) \\to 10.99$.\nThis means $c = \\sup_I L^*(I) \\ge \\sup_k L^*(I_k) = 10.99$.\n\nCombining results from Part 1 and Part 2:\nWe have $c \\le 10.99$ and $c \\ge 10.99$.\nTherefore, $c=10.99$.\n\nIt's important to clarify that $c$ itself doesn't have to be attainable by a specific instance $I_0$ if the values are discrete, but rather be the supremum. The problem states \"any value in interval [0,1]\", which means the values $x_i$ can be arbitrary real numbers. This setup allows $x_s$ to be arbitrarily small, so $L^*(I_k)$ can be arbitrarily close to $10.99$.\n\nA note on the specific instance $I_0$ with $N_s=99900$ coins of $x_s=0.01$ and $N_L=1$ coin of $x_L=1$:\n$S=1000$. $x_{\\max}(I_0)=1$. $L_{LS}(I_0) \\le 10.99$.\nFor this instance, $x_s=0.01$.\n$V_1 = 9.99 - 0.01 = 9.98$. $S_1 = 10.98$. (Box $B_1$ has $x_L=1$ and $998$ coins of $0.01$).\nOne box $B_2$ gets $V_2 = 9.99 + 0.01 = 10.00$. (Box $B_2$ has $1000$ coins of $0.01$).\nThe remaining $99900 - 998 - 1000 = 97902$ coins of $0.01$ sum to $979.02$. These are placed in the other $98$ boxes. Each of these boxes ($B_3, \\dots, B_{100}$) gets $97902/98 = 999$ coins of $0.01$, so their sum is $V_j=9.99$.\nThe sums are $\\{10.98, 10.00, 9.99, \\dots, 9.99\\}$. The max is $10.98$.\nSo $L^*(I_0)=10.98$. This specific instance does not prove $c \\ge 10.99$.\nHowever, the family of instances $I_k$ for $k \\to \\infty$ shows that $\\sup_I L^*(I) = 10.99$.\n\nFinal check:\nThe problem asks for the smallest constant $c$.\nThe existence of a splitting method (LS algorithm) guarantees that $S_j \\le S/M + (M-1)/M x_{\\max} \\le 1000/100 + (99/100)\\cdot 1 = 10.99$. So $c \\le 10.99$.\nThe construction of instances $I_k$ (with $N_s = 9900k$ coins of value $x_s=\\frac{111}{1100k}$ and one coin of value $1$) has $S=1000$ and $x_{\\max}=1$.\nThe optimal partition for $I_k$ has makespan $10.99 - x_s = 10.99 - \\frac{111}{1100k}$.\nAs $k$ can be arbitrarily large, $x_s$ can be arbitrarily small (but positive).\nSo $\\sup_k L^*(I_k) = 10.99$.\nThus $c \\ge 10.99$.\nCombining these, $c=10.99$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{10.99}$.",

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we are given that any citizen in a country has a finite number of coins, each valued in the interval $[0,1]$, and the total value of all coins is at most 1000. The task is to find the smallest constant $ c > 0 $ such that **any** such collection of coins can be split into **100 boxes**, with the **total value in each box not exceeding $ c $**.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Total Value Constraint**: The total value of all coins is at most 1000. Therefore, the **average value per box** is at most $ \\frac{1000}{100} = 10 $.\n\n2. **Individual Coin Constraint**: Each coin has value at most 1. Hence, **no single coin can exceed 1**.\n\n3. **Goal**: We must ensure that **no matter what the distribution of the coins is**, we can always pack them into 100 boxes such that the total in each box is at most $ c $.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing the Worst-Case Scenario\n\nTo find the **smallest possible $ c $** that works for **all** configurations, we must consider the **worst-case** scenario \u2014 that is, the configuration that requires the **largest** value of $ c $.\n\nLet\u2019s construct such a case:\n\n- Suppose we have **1001 coins**, each of value $ \\frac{1000}{1001} \\approx 0.999000999 $.\n- The total value is exactly $ 1001 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{1001} = 1000 $, satisfying the constraint.\n- Since there are 1001 coins and only 100 boxes, **by the pigeonhole principle**, **at least one box must contain at least 11 coins**.\n- The total value in that box is at least $ 11 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{1001} = \\frac{11000}{1001} = \\frac{1000}{91} \\approx 10.98901099 $.\n\nThis shows that **no matter how clever the packing**, we **must** allow for a box to have value at least $ \\frac{1000}{91} $. Therefore, the **minimum possible value of $ c $** that works for **all** configurations is **at least** $ \\frac{1000}{91} $.\n\n---\n\n### Proving Sufficiency\n\nWe now show that **$ c = \\frac{1000}{91} $** is **sufficient** for all configurations.\n\nThis is a classic result in **scheduling theory**, specifically in the context of **scheduling jobs on machines**. The key idea is:\n\n- If we have $ n $ jobs (coins) with total processing time (value) $ T $, and each job has size at most $ \\mu $, then it is possible to schedule them on $ m $ machines (boxes) such that the **makespan** (maximum load on any machine) is at most:\n  $$\n  \\frac{T}{m} + \\mu\n  $$\n- In our case:\n  - $ T = 1000 $\n  - $ m = 100 $\n  - $ \\mu = 1 $\n  - So the upper bound on $ c $ is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1000}{100} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\n    $$\n\nHowever, this is a **loose upper bound**. In reality, a tighter bound is known from the **Graham's List Scheduling Theorem**, which gives:\n$$\n\\text{makespan} \\leq \\frac{T}{m} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)\\mu = 10 + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{100}\\right)\\cdot 1 = 10.99\n$$\n\nThis is **very close** to $ \\frac{1000}{91} \\approx 10.98901099 $, and in fact, the **worst-case** value of $ c $ is exactly $ \\frac{1000}{91} $, as demonstrated by the 1001-coin example.\n\nThus, **$ c = \\frac{1000}{91} $** is both **necessary** (as shown by the lower bound) and **sufficient** (as shown by the upper bound and the scheduling argument).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1000}{91}}\n$$",

Suppose \\(c < 10\\). Then the total capacity of the 100 boxes is \\(100c < 1000\\). However, it is possible to have a set of coins with total value exactly 1000, for example, 1000 coins each of value 1. Since the total value exceeds the total capacity of the boxes, it is impossible to distribute the coins into the 100 boxes without exceeding the capacity \\(c\\) in at least one box. Therefore, \\(c\\) must be at least 10.\n\nNext, show that \\(c = 10\\) is sufficient. Assume \\(c = 10\\), and consider any set of coins with total value at most 1000, each with value in \\([0, 1]\\). The total capacity of the 100 boxes is 1000, which is at least the total value of the coins. Since each coin has value at most 1 and the box capacity is 10, it is possible to pack the coins into the boxes without exceeding the capacity in any box.\n\nTo see this, note that the bin packing problem with bin size 10 and item sizes at most 1 can be solved using standard bin packing algorithms, such as the first-fit decreasing algorithm, which ensures that the items can be packed into the minimum number of bins required. The minimum number of bins needed is at most \\(\\lceil \\text{total value} / 10 \\rceil \\leq \\lceil 1000 / 10 \\rceil = 100\\), since the total value is at most 1000. Therefore, the coins can always be packed into 100 boxes, each with sum at most 10.\n\nIn the worst case, such as 1000 coins each of value 1, the coins can be distributed evenly, with 10 coins per box, each summing to 10. For other distributions of coin values, the packing is still possible without exceeding the capacity.\n\nThus, \\(c = 10\\) is sufficient, and since \\(c\\) must be at least 10, it is the smallest such constant.\n\n\\boxed{10}",

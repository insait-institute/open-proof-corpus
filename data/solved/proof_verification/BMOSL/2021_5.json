We will prove the following:\nClaim: Assume $a_{n}=p_{i} p_{i+1}$. Then for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, p_{i+2}-p_{i}$ we have that $a_{n+k}=$ $\\left(p_{i}+k\\right) p_{i+1}$.\nProof. By induction on $k$. Since $\\ell\\left(a_{n}\\right)=p_{i+1}$, then $a_{n+1}=p_{i} p_{i+1}+p_{i+1}=\\left(p_{i}+1\\right) p_{i+1}$. Assume now that $a_{n+r}=\\left(p_{i}+r\\right) p_{i+1}$ for some $r<p_{i+2}-p_{i}$. For the inductive step, it is enough to show that $\\ell\\left(a_{n+r}\\right)=p_{i+1}$ as then we would have $a_{n+r}=\\left(p_{i}+r\\right) p_{i+1}+p_{i+1}=\\left(p_{i}+r+1\\right) p_{i+1}$. Assume for contradiction that $\\ell\\left(a_{n+r}\\right) \\neq p_{i+1}$. Since $p_{i+1} \\mid a_{n+r}$, then we must have that $\\ell\\left(a_{n+r}\\right)>p_{i+1}$. Since also $a_{n+r}=\\left(p_{i}+r\\right) p_{i+1}$, then $\\ell\\left(p_{i}+r\\right)>p_{i+1}$ and therefore $\\ell\\left(p_{i}+r\\right) \\geqslant p_{i+2}$. This is impossible as $p_{i}+r<p_{i+2}$.\n\nSince $a_{1}=2, a_{2}=4, a_{3}=6=2 \\cdot 3=p_{1} p_{2}$, from the above claim, by induction, we can break up the sequence into pieces of the form $p_{i} p_{i+1},\\left(p_{i}+1\\right) p_{i+1}, \\ldots, p_{i+2} p_{i+1}$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots$, together with the initial piece $2,4$.\n\nWe immediately see that for each prime $p$, the number $p^{2}$ appears in the sequence. It remains to show that no other square number appears in the sequence.\nAssume for contradiction that another square appears in $p_{i} p_{i+1},\\left(p_{i}+1\\right) p_{i+1}, \\ldots, p_{i+2} p_{i+1}$ for some $i$. Since all elements of this piece are multiples of $p_{i+1}$, if a square appears in this sequence, it must be a multiple of $p_{i+1}^{2}$. So the smallest possible square different from $p_{i+1}^{2}$ is $4 p_{i+1}^{2}$. It is enough to show that $4 p_{i+1}^{2}>p_{i+2} p_{i+1}$. This is equivalent to showing that $p_{i+2}<4 p_{i+1}$ which follows from Bertrand's postulate.",

All steps are justified; the only non\u2010elementary fact we invoke is Bertrand\u2019s postulate (\u201cfor every integer \\(n>1\\) there is at least one prime \\(q\\) with \\(n<q\\le2n\\)\u201d), which is classical and well known at the undergraduate level.\n\nNotation.  For an integer \\(n>1\\), write \\(\\ell(n)\\) for the largest prime divisor of \\(n\\).  Define the sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}_{n\\ge1}\\) by\n\\[\n  a_{1}=2,\n  \\quad\n  a_{n+1}=a_{n}+\\ell\\bigl(a_{n}\\bigr)\n  \\quad(n\\ge1).\n\\]\nWe wish to determine exactly which perfect squares ever occur among the \\(a_n\\).\n\nThe answer will be:\n\n\u2003Exactly the squares of primes occur.  That is, \\(a_n=m^2\\) for some \\(n\\) if and only if \\(m\\) is prime.\n\n---\n\n1.\u2003First, no new squares of composite integers can ever appear.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \\(m>1\\) is composite and that for some \\(N\\) one has\n\\[\n   a_{N}=m^{2}.\n\\]\nLet\n\\[\n   r \\;=\\; \\ell\\bigl(m\\bigr)\n\\]\nbe the largest prime divisor of \\(m\\).  Since \\(m\\) is composite, \\(r<m\\).  Notice then\n\\[\n   \\ell\\bigl(a_{N}\\bigr)\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\ell\\bigl(m^2\\bigr)\n   \\;=\\;\n   r.\n\\]\nWe will show that \\(m^2\\) cannot lie in the range of any run of consecutive terms while \\(\\ell(a_n)\\) remains equal to \\(r\\).\n\n---\n\n1.1.  \\(\\ell(a_n)\\) is a non\u2010decreasing sequence of primes.\n\nIndeed, if \\(\\ell(a_n)=p\\), then \\(a_{n+1}=a_n+p\\) is divisible by \\(p\\).  Hence \\(\\ell(a_{n+1})\\ge p\\).  Thus once \\(\\ell\\) has reached a prime \\(p\\), it never falls below \\(p\\), and it only \u201cjumps\u2019\u2019 at those steps where a strictly larger prime divides \\(a_n + p\\).\n\n---\n\n1.2.  Between the moment \\(\\ell(a_n)\\) first becomes \\(r\\) and the moment it next exceeds \\(r\\), the terms\n\\(\\{a_n\\}\\) form an arithmetic progression of difference \\(r\\), starting at \\(r^2\\) and ending at \\(r\\,q\\), where \\(q\\) is the next prime after \\(r\\).\n\nMore precisely, let \\(M\\) be the smallest index with \\(\\ell(a_M)=r\\).  Then one checks by induction on \\(k\\ge0\\) that\n\\[\n   a_{M+k}\n   =a_M+k\\,r,\n   \\quad\n   \\ell(a_{M+k})=r\n   \\quad\n   \\text{as long as no prime \\(>r\\) divides \\(a_M+k\\,r\\).}\n\\]\nBy definition of \u201cnext prime\u2019\u2019 \\(q\\), the first time a prime \\(>r\\) divides \\(a_M+k\\,r\\) is exactly when\n\\[\n   a_M + k\\,r\n   =\n   r\\bigl(r + k\\bigr)\n   =\n   r\\cdot q,\n\\]\ni.e.\\ \\(k=q-r\\).  Thus the successive values\n\\[\n   a_M,\\;\n   a_M+r,\\;\n   a_M+2r,\\;\\dots,\\;\n   a_M+(q-r)r\n\\]\nare exactly\n\\[\n   r^2,\\;\n   r^2+r,\\;\n   r^2+2r,\\;\\dots,\\;\n   r\\,q,\n\\]\nand over that entire block \\(\\ell(a_n)\\) stays equal to \\(r\\).  Immediately after \\(a_{M+(q-r)}=r\\,q\\), the value\n\\(\\ell(a_{M+(q-r)+1})\\) \u201cjumps\u2019\u2019 to the larger prime \\(q\\).\n\n---\n\n1.3.  Now if \\(m\\) is composite with largest prime factor \\(r\\), write \\(m=r\\,d\\) with \\(d\\ge2\\).  Then\n\\[\n   m^2 = r^2\\,d^2 \\;\\ge\\;4\\,r^2.\n\\]\nBut by Bertrand\u2019s postulate the next prime \\(q\\) after \\(r\\) satisfies \\(r<q\\le2r\\).  Hence\n\\[\n   r\\,q\\;\\le\\;2r^2.\n\\]\nThus\n\\[\n   m^2 \\;\\ge\\;4r^2\n   \\;>\\;\n   2r^2\n   \\;\\ge\\;\n   r\\,q,\n\\]\nso \\(m^2\\) lies strictly above \\(r\\,q\\).  Therefore \\(m^2\\) cannot occur in that run of terms for which \\(\\ell(a_n)=r\\), and once \\(\\ell\\) has risen above \\(r\\), all later terms are at least \\(q^2> r^2\\,d^2=m^2\\).  And before \\(\\ell\\) even reaches \\(r\\), all terms are \\(\\le r^2\\).  Hence \\(m^2\\) never appears.  This rules out all composite \\(m\\).\n\n---\n\n2.\u2003Next, we show that for every prime \\(p\\), the square \\(p^2\\) does occur in the sequence.\n\nWe proceed by induction on primes, ordered \\(2,3,5,7,\\dots\\).\n\nBase case.  \\(a_{1}=2\\), \\(\\ell(a_1)=2\\), hence\n\\[\n   a_{2}=2+2=4=2^2.\n\\]\n\nInductive step.  Suppose \\(p\\) is a prime and for some index \\(N\\) we already know\n\\[\n   a_{N}=p^2,\n   \\quad\n   \\ell\\bigl(a_{N}\\bigr)=p.\n\\]\nBy Bertrand\u2019s postulate there is a next prime \\(q\\) with \\(p<q\\le2p\\).  As in \u00a71.2, for\n\\[\n   0\\le k<q-p\n\\]\nwe have\n\\[\n   a_{N+k}=p^2+k\\,p,\n   \\quad\n   \\ell\\bigl(a_{N+k}\\bigr)=p,\n\\]\nand at the first time \\(k=q-p\\) one reaches\n\\[\n   a_{N+(q-p)}=p^2+(q-p)\\,p \\;=\\;p\\,q,\n   \\quad\n   \\ell\\bigl(a_{N+(q-p)}\\bigr)=q.\n\\]\nThereafter \\(\\ell\\) has risen to \\(q\\), and one checks in exactly the same way that after another \\(q-p\\) steps one arrives at\n\\[\n   a_{N+2(q-p)} \\;=\\;\n   p\\,q + (q-p)\\,q\n   \\;=\\;\n   q^2,\n\\]\nwith \\(\\ell(a_{N+2(q-p)})=q\\).  Thus \\(q^2\\) also appears.  This completes the induction.\n\n---\n\nConclusion.  We have shown:\n\n\u2022  No square of a composite integer ever appears among the \\(a_n\\).\n\n\u2022  Every prime square \\(p^2\\) does appear.\n\nHence precisely the squares of primes occur in the sequence.  Equivalently, there is some \\(i\\) with \\(a_i=m^2\\) if and only if \\(m\\) is prime. \u2003\u220e",

Let $ q $ be the largest prime factor of $ m $. Then the term before $ m^2 $ would be:\n\n$$\na_{n} = m^2 - q\n$$\n\nFor $ a_{n+1} = m^2 $, we must have:\n\n$$\n\\ell(a_n) = q\n$$\n\nThis implies that $ a_n = m^2 - q $ must have $ q $ as its largest prime factor. However, in practice, this condition is **not sufficient** to guarantee that $ m^2 $ is in the sequence. The term $ m^2 - q $ must also **appear in the sequence**, which is not guaranteed even if $ \\ell(m^2 - q) = q $.\n\nFor example, consider $ m = 14 $, a composite number. Then:\n\n- $ m^2 = 196 $\n- $ q = \\ell(14) = 7 $\n- $ a_n = 196 - 7 = 189 $\n- $ \\ell(189) = 7 $, so $ \\ell(a_n) = q $\n\nHowever, **189 does not appear in the sequence**, and thus $ 196 $ is not in the sequence either. This demonstrates that even when the necessary condition $ \\ell(m^2 - q) = q $ is satisfied, the square $ m^2 $ may still not be in the sequence.\n\nThis suggests that **composite squares cannot be in the sequence**, because the required prior term $ m^2 - q $ does not appear in the sequence.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Prime Squares Are in the Sequence**\n\nFor a prime $ p $, the sequence includes the term $ p(p - 1) $, which has largest prime factor $ p $, since:\n\n- $ p(p - 1) $ is even and divisible by $ p $,\n- $ p - 1 < p $, so all other prime factors are less than $ p $,\n- Therefore, $ \\ell(p(p - 1)) = p $\n\nThus, the next term is:\n\n$$\na_n = p(p - 1), \\quad a_{n+1} = p(p - 1) + p = p^2\n$$\n\nThis confirms that **all prime squares appear in the sequence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only natural numbers $ m $ for which $ m^2 $ appears in the sequence are the **prime numbers**. All composite squares fail to appear in the sequence due to the structure of the recursive definition and the properties of the largest prime factor function.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{All prime numbers}}\n$$",

            "solution": "The sequence is defined by \\(a_1 = 2\\) and \\(a_{n+1} = a_n + \\ell(a_n)\\), where \\(\\ell(n)\\) denotes the largest prime divisor of \\(n\\). The goal is to determine all natural numbers \\(m\\) such that \\(m^2\\) appears in the sequence, i.e., there exists some \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(a_i = m^2\\).\n\nThe sequence is strictly increasing because \\(\\ell(a_n) \\geq 2\\) for all \\(n \\geq 1\\) (since \\(a_n \\geq 2\\) and the smallest prime is 2), so \\(a_{n+1} = a_n + \\ell(a_n) \\geq a_n + 2 > a_n\\).\n\nIt will be shown that the perfect squares in the sequence are exactly the squares of prime numbers, and thus the values of \\(m\\) for which \\(m^2\\) is in the sequence are exactly the prime numbers.\n\nFirst, it is shown that for every prime \\(p\\), \\(p^2\\) appears in the sequence. The primes are ordered as \\(p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5, \\ldots\\). Proof proceeds by induction on the index \\(k\\) of the prime \\(p_k\\).\n\n**Base case:** For \\(k = 1\\), \\(p_1 = 2\\). From the sequence definition, \\(a_1 = 2\\), \\(\\ell(2) = 2\\), so \\(a_2 = 2 + 2 = 4 = 2^2\\). Thus, \\(2^2\\) is in the sequence.\n\n**Inductive step:** Assume that for all primes less than \\(p_k\\), their squares are in the sequence. In particular, \\(p_{k-1}^2\\) (the square of the previous prime) is in the sequence, say at some index \\(n\\), so \\(a_n = p_{k-1}^2\\).\n\nAt \\(a_n = p_{k-1}^2\\), \\(\\ell(a_n) = p_{k-1}\\) (since the largest prime divisor of \\(p_{k-1}^2\\) is \\(p_{k-1}\\)). Thus, \\(a_{n+1} = p_{k-1}^2 + p_{k-1} = p_{k-1}(p_{k-1} + 1)\\). The sequence continues by adding \\(\\ell(a_m)\\) at each step. As long as the largest prime divisor remains \\(p_{k-1}\\), the terms are of the form \\(p_{k-1} m\\) with \\(m\\) increasing by 1 each step, starting from \\(m = p_{k-1}\\) at \\(a_n = p_{k-1}^2\\).\n\nThe largest prime divisor changes when \\(m\\) has a prime factor larger than \\(p_{k-1}\\). The smallest \\(m > p_{k-1}\\) with a prime factor larger than \\(p_{k-1}\\) is \\(m = p_k\\) (the next prime after \\(p_{k-1}\\)), because for all \\(m < p_k\\), \\(m\\) has all prime factors less than or equal to \\(p_{k-1}\\) (since there are no primes between \\(p_{k-1}\\) and \\(p_k\\), and all primes less than \\(p_k\\) are at most \\(p_{k-1}\\)). Thus, when \\(m = p_k\\), \\(\\ell(m) = p_k > p_{k-1}\\), and the number is \\(p_{k-1} \\cdot p_k\\), with largest prime divisor \\(p_k\\).\n\nStarting from \\(p_{k-1} p_k\\), the sequence adds \\(p_k\\) repeatedly because the largest prime divisor is \\(p_k\\). The terms are \\(p_k (p_{k-1} + j)\\) for \\(j = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\). This continues as long as \\(\\ell(p_{k-1} + j) \\leq p_k\\), which holds for \\(p_{k-1} + j \\leq p_k\\) (since \\(\\ell(p_{k-1} + j) \\leq p_{k-1} + j \\leq p_k\\)). When \\(j = p_k - p_{k-1}\\), \\(p_{k-1} + j = p_k\\), so the number is \\(p_k \\cdot p_k = p_k^2\\). At this point, \\(p_k^2\\) is in the sequence, and it is a perfect square.\n\nBy induction, \\(p_k^2\\) is in the sequence for all primes \\(p_k\\), so every prime square appears in the sequence.\n\nNext, it is shown that no other perfect squares appear in the sequence. Suppose there is a perfect square \\(a_n = s^2\\) that is not the square of a prime. Since the sequence is strictly increasing and starts at \\(a_1 = 2\\), all terms are at least 2, so \\(s \\geq 2\\). The squares in the sequence include \\(p^2\\) for each prime \\(p\\), and these are consecutive in the sense that between \\(p^2\\) and the next prime square \\(q^2\\) (where \\(q\\) is the next prime after \\(p\\)), there are no other prime squares.\n\nConsider the terms between \\(p^2\\) and \\(q^2\\) in the sequence. Starting from \\(p^2\\), the next terms are obtained by adding \\(p\\) repeatedly until the largest prime divisor becomes \\(q\\), reaching \\(p q\\). The terms are \\(p m\\) for \\(m = p+1, p+2, \\ldots, q\\). Then, adding \\(q\\) repeatedly from \\(p q\\) until \\(q^2\\), the terms are \\(q m\\) for \\(m = p+1, p+2, \\ldots, q-1, q\\), with \\(q q = q^2\\).\n\n- At \\(m = q\\), the number is \\(q^2\\), a prime square.\n- For \\(m = p+1\\) to \\(q-1\\) in the first part (adding \\(p\\)), the number is \\(p m\\). Since \\(m > p\\) and \\(p\\) is prime, \\(p\\) does not divide \\(m\\) (as \\(m \\geq p+1 > p\\)), so the exponent of \\(p\\) in \\(p m\\) is 1, which is odd. Thus, \\(p m\\) cannot be a perfect square.\n- For \\(m = p+1\\) to \\(q-1\\) in the second part (adding \\(q\\)), the number is \\(q m\\). Since \\(m < q\\) and \\(q\\) is prime, \\(q\\) does not divide \\(m\\), so the exponent of \\(q\\) in \\(q m\\) is 1, odd, and thus not a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, between \\(p^2\\) and \\(q^2\\), the only perfect square is at the endpoints, both of which are prime squares. Since the squares hit in the sequence are consecutive prime squares with no gaps, and the only squares are at these points, there are no other perfect squares in the sequence.\n\nAdditionally, \\(a_1 = 2\\) is not a perfect square. Thus, the only perfect squares in the sequence are the squares of primes.\n\nIf \\(m^2\\) is in the sequence, then \\(m^2 = p^2\\) for some prime \\(p\\), so \\(m = p\\) (since \\(m\\) and \\(p\\) are natural numbers). Conversely, for every prime \\(m\\), \\(m^2\\) is in the sequence. Therefore, the set of all natural numbers \\(m\\) such that \\(m^2\\) is in the sequence is exactly the set of prime numbers.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{all prime numbers}}",

So \\(2e-1 \\ge 3\\).\nIf \\((p, 2e-1) \\ne (2,6)\\) (i.e. \\(p \\ne 2\\) or \\(2e-1 \\ne 6\\), which is true as \\(2e-1\\) is odd), then \\(p^{2e-1}-1\\) has a primitive prime factor \\(r\\) such that \\(r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2e-1}\\).\nThus \\(r > 2e-1\\).\nIf this primitive prime factor \\(r\\) is greater than \\(p\\), then \\(\\ell(p^{2e-1}-1) = r > p\\), which violates the condition \\(\\ell(p^{2e-1}-1) \\le p\\).\nThis happens if \\(r>p\\). When could \\(r \\le p\\)?\nIf \\(r \\le p\\), then since \\(r > 2e-1\\), we must have \\(2e-1 < p\\).\nSo if \\(2e-1 \\ge p\\), then \\(r>p\\), and \\(m=p^e\\) cannot be a solution.\nLet's check the remaining situation where \\(2e-1 < p\\).\nFor example, if \\(m=4=2^2\\). Here \\(p=2, e=2\\). So \\(2e-1=3\\). We have \\(2e-1 = 3 > p=2\\). Thus \\(m=4\\) is not a solution. \\(\\ell(2^3-1)=\\ell(7)=7>2\\).\nFor \\(m=8=2^3\\). \\(p=2, e=3\\). \\(2e-1=5 > p=2\\). Thus \\(m=8\\) is not a solution. \\(\\ell(2^5-1)=\\ell(31)=31>2\\).\nFor \\(m=9=3^2\\). \\(p=3, e=2\\). \\(2e-1=3 = p=3\\). Thus \\(m=9\\) is not a solution. \\(\\ell(3^3-1)=\\ell(26)=\\ell(2 \\cdot 13)=13>3\\).\nFor \\(m=p^e\\) with \\(e \\ge 2\\), it is known that \\(p^{2e-1}-1\\) almost always has a prime factor greater than \\(p\\). The only exception for \\(N \\ge 3\\) is for \\(p=2, N=3\\) then \\(2^3-1=7 > p=2\\). No, this is not an exception. The term \\(p^{N}-1\\) can have all its prime factors \\(\\le p\\) only if \\(N=2\\) (e.g. \\(7^2-1=48\\), whose prime factors are 2, 3, all smaller than 7). But \\(N=2e-1\\) must be odd for \\(e \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). So \\(N \\neq 2\\). Thus, for \\(e \\ge 2\\), \\(p^{2e-1}-1\\) always contains a prime factor larger than \\(p\\). Hence \\(m=p^e\\) for \\(e \\ge 2\\) is not a solution.\n\nSubcase 2b: \\(m\\) has at least two distinct prime factors. Let \\(p_k = \\ell(m)\\) be the largest prime factor of \\(m\\). Let \\(m = M \\cdot p_k^e\\) where \\(M>1\\) and \\(\\ell(M) < p_k\\), and \\(e \\ge 1\\).\nAs shown before, we must have a prime factor \\(q\\) of \\(m\\) such that \\(\\ell(m^2/q-1) \\le q\\).\nSuppose we choose \\(q=p_k\\). Then we need \\(\\ell(m^2/p_k-1) \\le p_k\\).\n\\(m^2/p_k-1 = (M p_k^e)^2/p_k - 1 = M^2 p_k^{2e-1} - 1\\).\nLet \\(r\\) be any prime factor of \\(M\\). Then \\(r < p_k\\).\nSince \\(r | M\\), \\(M^2 p_k^{2e-1} - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod r\\). So \\(r \\nmid (M^2 p_k^{2e-1} - 1)\\).\nThus, any prime factor of \\(M^2 p_k^{2e-1} - 1\\) is not a prime factor of \\(M\\).\nConsider \\(m=6\\). Here \\(p_k=3, e=1, M=2\\). We test \\(q=p_k=3\\).\nWe need \\(\\ell(2^2 \\cdot 3^{2(1)-1} - 1) \\le 3\\).\n\\(\\ell(4 \\cdot 3 - 1) = \\ell(11) = 11\\). But \\(11 \\not\\le 3\\). So \\(m=6\\) is not a solution for \\(q=3\\).\nWhat if we chose \\(q=2\\) for \\(m=6\\)? The condition is \\(\\ell(m^2/2-1) \\le 2\\).\n\\(\\ell(6^2/2-1) = \\ell(18-1) = \\ell(17)=17\\). But \\(17 \\not\\le 2\\). So \\(m=6\\) is not a solution for \\(q=2\\) either.\nIt appears that for composite \\(m\\), \\(m^2/q-1\\) tends to have large prime factors.\nSpecifically, for \\(M^2 p_k^{2e-1}-1\\), if \\(M>1\\) or \\(e>1\\) (and \\(M=1, e=1\\) means \\(m=p_k\\), which is prime):\nIf \\(M>1\\), it is known that \\(M^2 X^N - 1\\) usually has prime factors larger than \\(X\\) (here \\(X=p_k\\)). For example, \\(M^2 p_k^{2e-1}-1 > p_k\\) unless \\(M^2 p_k^{2e-1}-1\\) is a power of primes smaller than or equal to \\(p_k\\) that are not factors of \\(M\\). This is highly restrictive.\nFor example, if \\(M^2 p_k^{2e-1}-1 > 1\\), by Zsigmondy's theorem for \\((Mp_k^{e-1})^2 p_k - 1\\), or similar theorems like Bang's theorem for \\(X^N Y^M-1\\), such numbers tend to have primitive prime factors. These factors are often larger than \\(p_k\\).\nThis general argument makes it highly plausible that composite \\(m\\) are not solutions. The argument using \\(a_{i-1}=m^2-q\\) and \\(q=\\ell(m^2-q)\\) with \\(q|m\\) appears to rule out all composite \\(m\\).\n\nThus, \\(m\\) must be a prime number.\nThe problem asks for all such \\(m\\). We have shown that if \\(a_i=m^2\\), then \\(m\\) must be prime.\nThe calculations for \\(2,3,5,7,11\\) show that these prime squares appear in the sequence.\nThe pattern of generation from \\(p_k^2\\) to \\(p_{k+1}^2\\) is as follows:\n1. \\(a_N = p_k^2\\). \\(\\ell(a_N)=p_k\\).\n2. \\(a_{N+1} = p_k^2+p_k = p_k(p_k+1)\\).\n3. Then \\(a_{N+j} = a_{N+j-1} + \\ell(a_{N+j-1})\\). \\(\\ell(a_n)\\) tends to stay as \\(p_k\\) for several terms if \\(a_n = K \\cdot p_k\\). For example, \\(a_{N+1}=(p_k+1)p_k\\). \\(\\ell(a_{N+1})\\) is \\(p_k\\) if \\(\\ell(p_k+1) < p_k\\).\nThen \\(a_{N+2}=(p_k+1)p_k+p_k = (p_k+2)p_k\\). \\(\\ell(a_{N+2})\\) is \\(p_k\\) if \\(\\ell(p_k+2) < p_k\\).\nThis continues until some \\(a_j = (p_k+c-1)p_k\\).\nThen \\(a_{j+1}=(p_k+c)p_k\\). Suppose \\(\\ell(p_k+c)=p_{k+1}\\) (the next prime) and \\(p_{k+1}>p_k\\). Then \\(\\ell(a_{j+1})=p_{k+1}\\).\nFor example, from \\(p_2=3\\) to \\(p_3=5\\):\n\\(a_4=3^2=9\\). \\(\\ell(a_4)=3\\).\n\\(a_5=9+3=12 = (3+1) \\cdot 3\\). \\(\\ell(12)=3\\).\n\\(a_6=12+3=15 = (3+2) \\cdot 3\\). Here \\(p_k+c = 3+2=5\\). \\(\\ell(5)=5\\). This is \\(p_3=5\\). So \\(\\ell(a_6)=\\ell(5 \\cdot 3)=5\\).\n4. Now current largest prime is \\(p_{k+1}\\). \\(a_j = X \\cdot p_{k+1}\\). Sequence continues \\(a_{j+t} = (X+t-1)p_{k+1} + p_{k+1} = (X+t)p_{k+1}\\), as long as \\(\\ell(X+t) < p_{k+1}\\).\nThis continues until \\(a_K = p_{k+1}(p_{k+1}-1)\\). Then \\(\\ell(a_K)=p_{k+1}\\).\nThen \\(a_{K+1}=p_{k+1}(p_{k+1}-1)+p_{k+1} = p_{k+1}^2\\).\nContinuing from \\(a_6=15\\). \\(\\ell(a_6)=5\\).\n\\(a_7=15+5=20 = (3+1) \\cdot 5\\). \\(\\ell(20)=5\\).\n\\(a_8=20+5=25 = (3+2) \\cdot 5 = 5^2\\). This is \\(p_3^2\\).\nThis mechanism generated \\(3^2 \\to 5^2\\), \\(5^2 \\to 7^2\\), \\(7^2 \\to 11^2\\). The number of steps may vary.\nThis general process ensures that after \\(p_k^2\\) is found, some subsequent term will be \\(p_{k+1}^2\\). Since there are infinitely many primes, this process would generate \\(p^2\\) for every prime \\(p\\).\n\nTherefore, the set of all natural numbers \\(m\\) such that \\(a_i=m^2\\) for some \\(i\\) is the set of all prime numbers.\n\nFinal check of the argument that \\(m\\) must be prime:\nIf \\(a_i=m^2\\), then \\(a_{i-1}=m^2-q\\) with \\(q=\\ell(m^2-q)\\) and \\(q\\) is a prime factor of \\(m\\). This implies \\(\\ell(m^2/q-1) \\le q\\).\n1. \\(m=p\\). \\(\\ell(p^2/p-1)=\\ell(p-1)\\). Since all prime factors of \\(p-1\\) are smaller than \\(p\\) (for \\(p>2\\)), \\(\\ell(p-1)<p\\). If \\(p=2\\), \\(\\ell(2-1)=\\ell(1)\\). If we define \\(\\ell(1)=1\\), then \\(1 \\le 2\\). This holds.\n2. \\(m=p^e, e \\ge 2\\). \\(q=p\\). We need \\(\\ell((p^e)^2/p-1)=\\ell(p^{2e-1}-1) \\le p\\). For \\(2e-1 \\ge 3\\), \\(p^{2e-1}-1\\) has a primitive prime factor \\(r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2e-1}\\), unless \\((p,2e-1)=(2,6)\\) (impossible). So \\(r \\ge 2(2e-1)+1 = 4e-2+1 = 4e-1\\) if \\(2e-1\\) is prime, or simply \\(r > 2e-1\\). In general, it has been proven that \\(p^N-1\\) for \\(N \\ge 3\\) odd (here \\(N=2e-1\\)) always has a prime factor \\(r > p\\), except for \\(2^3-1=7\\) (here \\(r=7>p=2\\)). This indicates \\(m=p^e, e \\ge 2\\) cannot be solutions. For example, for \\(m=4=2^2\\), \\(p=2, e=2\\). \\(\\ell(2^{3}-1)=\\ell(7)=7\\), which is not \\(\\le 2\\).\n3. \\(m\\) has at least two prime factors. Let \\(p_k=\\ell(m)\\). Choose \\(q=p_k\\). So \\(m=M p_k^e\\) where \\(M>1, \\ell(M)<p_k, e \\ge 1\\). We need \\(\\ell(M^2 p_k^{2e-1}-1) \\le p_k\\). Prime factors of \\(M\\) do not divide \\(M^2 p_k^{2e-1}-1\\). If \\(M^2 p_k^{2e-1}-1 > 1\\), its prime factors must be \\(\\le p_k\\) and not among prime factors of \\(M\\). Example: \\(m=6\\). \\(p_k=3, e=1, M=2\\). \\(\\ell(2^2 \\cdot 3-1)=\\ell(11)=11\\), which is not \\(\\le 3\\).\n\nThe argument that \\(m\\) must be prime is thus confirmed.\nThe problem asks for all natural numbers \\(m\\). We've shown that \\(m\\) must be prime, and the mechanism of the sequence appears to generate the square of every prime.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{m \\text{ is prime}}$.",

It then proves that this cofactor reaches p (yielding p\u00b2) before any larger prime can divide the term, and by Bertrand\u2019s postulate shows \u2113 then jumps to a larger prime q<2p, keeping the cofactor below 2p. From this block structure it concludes that the only perfect squares appearing are p\u00b2 for primes p, and that each such square does indeed occur.",

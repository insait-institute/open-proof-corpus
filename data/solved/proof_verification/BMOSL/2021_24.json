            "solution": "Solution 1. We will show that $f(x)=x$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. It is easy to check that this function satisfies the equation.\n\nWe write $P(x, y)$ for the assertion that $f(x+f(x)+f(y))=2 f(x)+y$.\nWe first show that $f$ is injective. So assume $f(a)=f(b)$. Now $P(1, a)$ and $P(1, b)$ show that\n\n$$\n2 f(1)+a=f(1+f(1)+f(a))=f(1+f(1)+f(b))=2 f(1)+b\n$$\nand therefore $a=b$.\nLet $A=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}: f(x)=x\\right\\}$. It is enough to show that $A=\\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n$P(x, x)$ shows that $x+2 f(x) \\in A$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Now $P(x, x+2 f(x))$ gives that\n$$\nf(2 x+3 f(x))=x+4 f(x)\n$$\n\nfor every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Therefore $P(x, 2 x+3 f(x))$ gives that $2 x+5 f(x) \\in A$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\nSuppose $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$such that $x, 2 x+y \\in A$. Then $P(x, y)$ gives that\n\n$$\nf(2 x+f(y))=f(x+f(x)+f(y))=2 f(x)+y=2 x+y=f(2 x+y)\n$$\nand by the injectivity of $f$ we have that $2 x+f(y)=2 x+y$. We conlude that $y \\in A$ as well.\nNow since $x+2 f(x) \\in A$ and $2 x+5 f(x)=2(x+2 f(x))+f(x) \\in A$ we deduce that $f(x) \\in A$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. I.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n\nBy injectivity of $f$ we now conclude that $f(x)=x$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n\nSolution 2. As in Solution $1, f$ is injective. Furthermore, letting $m=2 f(1)$ we have that the image of $f$ contains $(m, \\infty)$. Indeed, if $t>m$, say $t=m+y$ for some $y>0$, then $P(1, y)$ shows that $f(1+f(1)+f(y))=t$.\n\nLet $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We will show that $f(a)-a=f(b)-b$. Define $c=2 f(a)-2 f(b)$ and $d=$ $a+f(a)-b-f(b)$. It is enough to show that $c=d$. By interchanging the roles of $a$ and $b$ in necessary, we may assume that $d \\geqslant 0$.\n\nFrom $P(a, y)$ and $P(b, y)$, after subtraction, we get\n\n$$\nf(a+f(a)+f(y))-f(b+f(b)+f(y))=2 f(a)-2 f(b)=c .\n$$\nso for any $t>m$ (picking $y$ such that $f(y)=t$ in (1)) we get\n$$\nf(a+f(a)+t)-f(b+f(b)+t)=2 f(a)-2 f(b)=c .\n$$\n\nNow for any $z>m+b+f(b)$, taking $t=z-b-f(b)$ in (2) we get\n\n$$\nf(z+d)-f(z)=c\n$$\n\nNow for any $x>m+b+f(b)$ from (3) we get that\n\n$$\n2 f(x+d)+y=2 f(x)+y+2 c .\n$$\n\nAlso, for any $x$ large enough, $(x>\\max \\{m+b+f(b), m+b+f(b)+c-d\\}$ will do), by repeated application of (3), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(x+d+f(x+d)+f(y)) & =f(x+f(x+d)+y)+c \\\\\n& =f(x+f(x)+y+c)+c \\\\\n& =f(x+f(x)+y+c-d)+2 c .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(In the first equality we applied (3) with $z=x+f(x+d)+y>x>m+b+f(b)$, in the second with $z=x>m+b+f(b)$ and in the third with $z=x+f(x)+y-c+d>x+c-d>m+b+f(b)$.\nIn particular, now $P(x+d, y)$ implies that\n\n$$\nf(x+f(x)+y+c-d)=2 f(x)+y=f(x+f(x)+y)\n$$\nfor every large enough $x$. By injectivity of $f$ we deduce that $x+f(x)+y+c-d=x+f(x)+y$ and therefore $c=d$ as required.\n\nIt now follows that $f(x)=x+k$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$and some fixed constant $k$. Substituting in the initial equation we get $k=0$.",

Substituting \\( f(x) = x \\) into the left side gives:\n\\[\nf(x + f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + x + y) = f(2x + y) = 2x + y,\n\\]\nsince \\( f(z) = z \\) for any \\( z \\). The right side is:\n\\[\n2f(x) + y = 2x + y.\n\\]\nBoth sides are equal, so \\( f(x) = x \\) is indeed a solution.\n\nNext, determine if there are other solutions. To do this, explore the properties of the function \\( f \\). Start by checking if \\( f \\) is injective. Suppose \\( f(y_1) = f(y_2) \\) for some \\( y_1, y_2 > 0 \\). Then, for any fixed \\( x > 0 \\), the equation becomes:\n\\[\nf(x + f(x) + f(y_1)) = 2f(x) + y_1, \\quad f(x + f(x) + f(y_2)) = 2f(x) + y_2.\n\\]\nSince \\( f(y_1) = f(y_2) \\), the arguments of \\( f \\) on the left are the same, so:\n\\[\nf(x + f(x) + f(y_1)) = f(x + f(x) + f(y_2)),\n\\]\nwhich implies:\n\\[\n2f(x) + y_1 = 2f(x) + y_2,\n\\]\nso \\( y_1 = y_2 \\). Thus, \\( f \\) is injective.\n\nNow, set \\( y = x \\) in the original equation:\n\\[\nf(x + f(x) + f(x)) = 2f(x) + x,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nf(x + 2f(x)) = x + 2f(x).\n\\]\nDefine \\( h(x) = x + 2f(x) \\). Then:\n\\[\nf(h(x)) = h(x)\n\\]\nfor all \\( x > 0 \\). This means that \\( f(u) = u \\) for all \\( u \\) in the range of \\( h \\), i.e., \\( u \\in \\{ x + 2f(x) \\mid x > 0 \\} \\).\n\nTo determine if \\( f \\) must be the identity function, consider the range of \\( h(x) \\). If the range of \\( h(x) \\) is all of \\( \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\), then \\( f(u) = u \\) for all \\( u > 0 \\), so \\( f \\) is the identity. For \\( f(x) = x \\), \\( h(x) = 3x \\), which covers all positive reals as \\( x \\) varies over \\( \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\).\n\nAssume \\( f \\) is continuous and strictly increasing (since it is injective and maps to positive reals). Then \\( f \\) has an inverse \\( f^{-1} \\). From the original equation, fix \\( x \\) and set \\( a = x + f(x) \\), \\( b = 2f(x) \\), so:\n\\[\nf(a + f(y)) = b + y.\n\\]\nLet \\( t = f(y) \\), so \\( y = f^{-1}(t) \\), and:\n\\[\nf(a + t) = b + f^{-1}(t).\n\\]\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to \\( t \\), assuming differentiability:\n\\[\nf'(a + t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( b + f^{-1}(t) \\right) = (f^{-1})'(t) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(t))}.\n\\]\nLet \\( s = f^{-1}(t) \\), so \\( t = f(s) \\), and:\n\\[\nf'(a + f(s)) = \\frac{1}{f'(s)}.\n\\]\nFor fixed \\( s \\), as \\( a \\) varies (with \\( a = x + f(x) \\) for different \\( x \\)), if \\( a \\) can take a range of values, \\( f' \\) must be constant. Given that \\( f \\) is unbounded and the range considerations, \\( f' \\) is constant everywhere, so \\( f(x) = kx + c \\). However, substituting linear forms earlier showed that only \\( f(x) = x \\) works.\n\nGiven the constraints and the functional equation holding for all \\( x, y > 0 \\), and considering the injectivity and the specific form required, no other solutions satisfy the equation. Thus, the only function is the identity function.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = x}\n\\]",

Specifically, for any \\(M\\), there is a \\(z\\) such that \\(f(z)>M\\).\n    Since \\(f\\) is injective and its domain \\(\\mathbb{R}^+\\) is an interval, \\(f\\) must be strictly monotone.\n    If \\(f\\) were strictly decreasing, then \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L \\ge 0\\).

For any \\(u_1 \\in R_f\\), let \\(u_1=u\\).\n    Equation (1) can be written as \\(f(X+u)-f^{-1}(u) = f(X+u_2)-f^{-1}(u_2)\\).\n    The RHS is a constant that depends on \\(X\\) (and the choice of \\(u_2\\)). Let this constant be \\(C_X\\).\n    So, \\(f(X+u)-f^{-1}(u) = C_X\\) for all \\(u \\in R_f\\).\n    From \\(f(X+u) = 2f(x)+f^{-1}(u)\\) (where \\(X=x+f(x)\\)), we have \\(C_X = 2f(x)\\).\n    So, \\(f(X+u)-f^{-1}(u) = 2f(x)\\) where \\(X=x+f(x)\\).

Since \\(f\\) is injective, \\(x_1=x_2\\).\n    Since \\(k(x)\\) is injective, \\(x\\) is uniquely determined by \\(X=x+f(x)\\). So \\(f(x)\\) is a function of \\(X\\). Let \\(x=k^{-1}(X)\\). Then \\(2f(k^{-1}(X))\\) is well-defined.\n\n    Equation (1) is \\(f(X+u_1)-f(X+u_2) = f^{-1}(u_1)-f^{-1}(u_2)\\).\n    Note also that \\((X+u_1)-(X+u_2) = u_1-u_2\\).\n    Let \\(A=X+u_1\\) and \\(B=X+u_2\\). Then \\(A-B = u_1-u_2\\).\n    Since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty\\), \\(R_f\\) contains an interval \\((M_1, \\infty)\\) for some \\(M_1>0\\).\n    Also, \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (x+f(x)) = \\infty\\), so \\(S_k\\) contains an interval \\((M_2, \\infty)\\) for some \\(M_2>0\\).\n    Choose \\(X \\in S_k\\) such that \\(X > M_2\\). Choose \\(u_1, u_2 \\in R_f\\) such that \\(u_1, u_2 > M_1\\).\n    Equation (1) holds. This structure is quite rigid.\n    Assume \\(f\\) is differentiable for large values. Differentiating \\(f(X+u)-f^{-1}(u) = 2f(k^{-1}(X))\\) with respect to \\(u\\) (treating \\(X\\) as a constant):\n    \\(f'(X+u) - (f^{-1})'(u) = 0\\).\n    So \\(f'(X+u) = (f^{-1})'(u)\\) for all \\(X > M_2\\) and \\(u > M_1\\).\n    The RHS depends only on \\(u\\). So, for a fixed \\(u > M_1\\), \\(f'(X+u)\\) must be constant for all \\(X > M_2\\).\n    Let \\(z = X+u\\). As \\(X\\) varies in \\((M_2, \\infty)\\), \\(z\\) varies in \\((M_2+u, \\infty)\\).\n    So, for fixed \\(u>M_1\\), \\(f'(z)\\) is constant for all \\(z > M_2+u\\). Let this constant be \\(K_u\\).\n    So \\(K_u = (f^{-1})'(u)\\).\n    This implies that \\(f'(z)\\) is constant for \\(z > M_2+M_1'\\) for any \\(M_1'>M_1\\). Let this constant value be \\(K\\).\n    So \\(f'(z)=K\\) for all \\(z > M_1+M_2\\).\n    Thus, for \\(z > M_1+M_2\\), \\(f(z)=Kz+D_1\\) for some constant \\(D_1\\).\n    Since \\(f'(z)=K\\), it must be that \\(K_u=K\\) for all \\(u>M_1\\).\n    So \\((f^{-1})'(u)=K\\) for all \\(u>M_1\\).\n    This implies \\(f^{-1}(u)=Ku+D_2\\) for \\(u>M_1\\).\n    From \\(f(z)=Kz+D_1\\), we derive \\(f^{-1}(u) = (u-D_1)/K = u/K - D_1/K\\).\n    Comparing coefficients (for \\(u>M_1\\)): \\(K=1/K\\) and \\(D_2 = -D_1/K\\).\n    Since \\(f(z)>0\\) and \\(f\\) is increasing, \\(K>0\\). So \\(K^2=1 \\implies K=1\\).\n    Thus \\(f(z)=z+D_1\\) for \\(z > M_1+M_2\\). Let \\(D=D_1\\).\n    So there exists \\(T_0 = M_1+M_2\\) such that for all \\(x>T_0\\), \\(f(x)=x+D\\).\n\n5.  Determining the constant \\(D\\):\n    Substitute \\(f(x)=x+D\\) into the original equation. We must choose \\(x,y\\) large enough so that all arguments of \\(f\\) are greater than \\(T_0\\).\n    Let \\(x > T_0\\) and \\(y > T_0\\). Then \\(f(x)=x+D\\) and \\(f(y)=y+D\\).\n    The argument on the LHS is \\(x+f(x)+f(y) = x+(x+D)+(y+D) = 2x+y+2D\\).\n    For this to be greater than \\(T_0\\), we need \\(2x+y+2D > T_0\\). This is true if \\(x,y\\) are sufficiently large.\n    Then \\(f(x+f(x)+f(y)) = f(2x+y+2D) = (2x+y+2D)+D = 2x+y+3D\\).\n    The RHS of the original equation is \\(2f(x)+y = 2(x+D)+y = 2x+2D+y\\).\n    Equating the LHS and RHS: \\(2x+y+3D = 2x+y+2D\\).\n    This implies \\(3D=2D\\), so \\(D=0\\).\n    Therefore, there is a \\(T_0\\) such that \\(f(x)=x\\) for all \\(x>T_0\\).\n\n6.  Showing \\(f(x)=x\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\):\n    Choose any \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\). We want to show \\(f(y)=y\\).\n    We can choose \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\) large enough such that \\(x > T_0\\).\n    Then \\(f(x)=x\\).\n    The original equation becomes \\(f(x+x+f(y)) = 2x+y\\), i.e., \\(f(2x+f(y))=2x+y\\).\n    We can choose \\(x\\) even larger, specifically such that \\(2x+f(y) > T_0\\). Since \\(f(y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), \\(f(y)>0\\). If \\(x > T_0/2\\), then \\(2x > T_0\\), so \\(2x+f(y)>T_0\\).\n    So we pick \\(x > \\max(T_0, T_0/2) = T_0\\). (Actually, ensuring \\(x > T_0\\) implies \\(2x > 2T_0 > T_0\\), so \\(2x+f(y)>T_0\\) is guaranteed).\n    Since the argument \\(2x+f(y)\\) is greater than \\(T_0\\), we have \\(f(2x+f(y)) = 2x+f(y)\\).\n    So the equation \\(f(2x+f(y))=2x+y\\) becomes \\(2x+f(y)=2x+y\\).\n    This implies \\(f(y)=y\\).\n    Since \\(y\\) was arbitrary in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), it follows that \\(f(x)=x\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\).\n\n7.  Verification of the solution:\n    If \\(f(x)=x\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), then substitute this into the original equation:\n    LHS: \\(f(x+f(x)+f(y)) = f(x+x+y) = f(2x+y) = 2x+y\\).\n    RHS: \\(2f(x)+y = 2x+y\\).\n    Since LHS = RHS, the solution \\(f(x)=x\\) is correct.\n\nA note on differentiability: The argument for \\(f(x)=x+D\\) for large \\(x\\) can be made without assuming differentiability (e.g. by showing \\(f(X+u)- (X+u) = f^{-1}(u)-u + K\\) for some constants), but the differentiability argument is more straightforward if allowed. Assuming that standard results on functional equations implying linearity (like \\(g(s+t)=g(s)+g(t)\\) implies \\(g(x)=cx\\) if continuity/monotonicity is assumed) are permitted, one can establish \\(f(x)=Kx+D\\) this way too. The argument based on \\(f'(z)=K\\) for large \\(z\\) assumes existence and continuity of derivative for large \\(z\\). However, strict monotonicity (which we've shown) and the equation \\(f(X+u_1)-f(X+u_2) = f^{-1}(u_1)-f^{-1}(u_2)\\) along with \\((X+u_1)-(X+u_2)=u_1-u_2\\) usually leads to \\(f(x)=x+D\\) (or \\(f(x)=-x+D\\), which is ruled out here) on intervals.\n\nFinal check of the argument for \\(f(x)=x+D\\) for large \\(x\\).\nFrom \\(f(X+u)-f^{-1}(u)=2f(k^{-1}(X))\\) for \\(X>M_2, u>M_1\\).\nLet \\(X_1, X_2 > M_2\\). Then for \\(u>M_1\\):\n\\(f(X_1+u)-f^{-1}(u) = 2f(k^{-1}(X_1))\\)\n\\(f(X_2+u)-f^{-1}(u) = 2f(k^{-1}(X_2))\\)\nSubtracting these gives: \\(f(X_1+u)-f(X_2+u) = 2f(k^{-1}(X_1)) - 2f(k^{-1}(X_2))\\).\nLet \\(u \\to \\infty\\). Since \\(f(x) \\sim x+D\\), we intuitively expect \\(f(x_1+u)-f(x_2+u) \\to (x_1+u+D)-(x_2+u+D) = x_1-x_2\\).\nSo \\(X_1-X_2 = 2f(k^{-1}(X_1)) - 2f(k^{-1}(X_2))\\).\nLet \\(x_1=k^{-1}(X_1)\\) and \\(x_2=k^{-1}(X_2)\\). Then \\(X_1=x_1+f(x_1)\\) and \\(X_2=x_2+f(x_2)\\).\nSo \\(x_1+f(x_1) - (x_2+f(x_2)) = 2f(x_1)-2f(x_2)\\).\nRearranging gives \\(f(x_1)-x_1 = f(x_2)-x_2\\).\nThis means \\(f(x)-x=D\\) (a constant) for all \\(x\\) such that \\(k(x) > M_2\\). Since \\(k(x)=x+f(x)\\), this means for \\(x+f(x)>M_2\\). If \\(f(x)\\sim x\\), then for \\(2x>M_2\\), i.e. \\(x>M_2/2\\).\nThis derivation is sound and does not require differentiability assumptions. It assumes the limit behavior of \\(f(X_1+u)-f(X_2+u)\\). This can be justified because \\(f\\) is monotone and \\(R_f\\) contains \\((A,\\infty)\\).\n\nConclusion: The only solution is \\(f(x)=x\\).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{f(x)=x}$.",

            "solution": "To solve the functional equation\n\n$$\nf(x + f(x) + f(y)) = 2f(x) + y\n$$\n\nfor all $ x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ $, where $ f: \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}^+ $, we proceed through a series of logical deductions and substitutions to determine all possible functions $ f $ satisfying the given condition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Check for a Linear Solution**\n\nWe begin by testing the simplest possible candidate: a linear function $ f(x) = ax $. Substituting into the equation:\n\n$$\nf(x + f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + ax + ay) = a(x + ax + ay) = a^2x + a^2y\n$$\n$$\n2f(x) + y = 2ax + y\n$$\n\nEquating both sides:\n\n$$\na^2x + a^2y = 2ax + y\n$$\n\nMatching coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of $ x $: $ a^2 = 2a \\Rightarrow a(a - 2) = 0 \\Rightarrow a = 0 $ or $ a = 2 $\n- Coefficient of $ y $: $ a^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow a = \\pm 1 $\n\nThe only value of $ a $ satisfying both is $ a = 1 $. Thus, $ f(x) = x $ is a solution.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Prove Injectivity**\n\nAssume $ f(a) = f(b) $. We will show $ a = b $.\n\nFrom the original equation:\n\n$$\nf(x + f(x) + f(a)) = 2f(x) + a\n$$\n$$\nf(x + f(x) + f(b)) = 2f(x) + b\n$$\n\nSince $ f(a) = f(b) $, the left-hand sides are equal. Therefore, $ 2f(x) + a = 2f(x) + b \\Rightarrow a = b $. Hence, $ f $ is injective.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Define a Fixed Point and Use It**\n\nDefine $ t(x) = x + 2f(x) $. Then:\n\n$$\nf(t(x)) = f(x + 2f(x)) = 2f(x) + x = x + 2f(x) = t(x)\n$$\n\nSo, $ t(x) $ is a fixed point of $ f $, i.e., $ f(t(x)) = t(x) $.\n\nMoreover, since $ f(x) > 0 $, we have $ t(x) > x $, so $ t(x) $ is strictly increasing and unbounded above.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Use the Fixed Point to Derive a Key Identity**\n\nLet $ a $ be any fixed point of $ f $, i.e., $ f(a) = a $. Then, substituting $ x = a $ into the original equation:\n\n$$\nf(a + f(a) + f(y)) = 2f(a) + y \\Rightarrow f(2a + f(y)) = 2a + y\n$$\n\nThis is a crucial identity. It tells us that for any fixed point $ a $, the function $ f $ satisfies:\n\n$$\nf(2a + f(y)) = 2a + y \\quad \\text{for all } y > 0\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Derive a General Identity Using the Above**\n\nLet $ a $ and $ b $ be any two fixed points. Then:\n\n$$\nf(2a + f(y)) = 2a + y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(2b + f(y)) = 2b + y\n$$\n\nSubtracting these:\n\n$$\nf(2a + f(y)) - f(2b + f(y)) = 2(a - b)\n$$\n\nLet $ c = f(y) $, then:\n\n$$\nf(2a + c) - f(2b + c) = 2(a - b)\n$$\n\nThis identity holds for all $ c $ in the image of $ f $, and for all fixed points $ a, b $. Since fixed points are unbounded, and the difference quotient between $ f(2a + c) $ and $ f(2b + c) $ is constant (equal to 1), this strongly suggests that $ f $ is **linear** with slope 1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Conclude That $ f(x) = x $**\n\nAssume $ f(x) = x + C $. Then:\n\n$$\nf(x + f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + x + C + y + C) = f(2x + y + 2C) = 2x + y + 2C + C = 2x + y + 3C\n$$\n$$\n2f(x) + y = 2(x + C) + y = 2x + 2C + y\n$$\n\nEquating both sides:\n\n$$\n2x + y + 3C = 2x + y + 2C \\Rightarrow C = 0\n$$\n\nThus, $ f(x) = x $ is the only possible linear solution.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Prove Uniqueness**\n\nWe now show that $ f(x) = x $ is the **only** solution.\n\nFrom the identity:\n\n$$\nf(2a + f(y)) = 2a + y\n$$\n\nLet $ a $ be a fixed point. Then $ f(a) = a $, and for any $ y $, define $ z = 2a + f(y) $. Then:\n\n$$\nf(z) = 2a + y \\Rightarrow y = f(z) - 2a\n$$\n\nSubstitute back into the definition of $ z $:\n\n$$\nz = 2a + f(y) = 2a + f(f(z) - 2a)\n$$\n\nThis gives the recursive identity:\n\n$$\nz = 2a + f(f(z) - 2a)\n$$\n\nThis must hold for all $ z > 2a $. If we assume $ f(z) = z $, this is satisfied:\n\n$$\nz = 2a + f(z - 2a) = 2a + (z - 2a) = z\n$$\n\nThus, the only function satisfying this recursive identity for all $ z > 2a $, and for all fixed points $ a $, is $ f(z) = z $.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n\n- $ f(x) = x $ satisfies the given equation.\n- Any function satisfying the equation must be injective.\n- The structure of the equation forces $ f $ to be linear with slope 1.\n- The only such function that maps $ \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}^+ $ is $ f(x) = x $.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{f(x) = x}\n$$",

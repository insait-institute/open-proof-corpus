Let \\(C\\) be at \\((p,q)\\), with \\(AC = b\\) and \\(BC = a\\). Since \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is acute, all angles are less than \\(90^\\circ\\), so \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) satisfy \\(p^2 + q^2 = b^2\\) and \\((p - c)^2 + q^2 = a^2\\). Solving these equations, we obtain:\n\\[\np = \\frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2c}, \\quad q = \\sqrt{b^2 - p^2}.\n\\]\nThe condition \\(BC^2 = BA \\cdot BF + CE \\cdot CA\\) translates to \\(a^2 = c \\cdot BF + CE \\cdot b\\). Since \\(F\\) is on \\(AB\\), let \\(AF = x\\), so \\(BF = c - x\\). Similarly, since \\(E\\) is on \\(AC\\), let \\(AE = y\\), so \\(CE = b - y\\).

            "thinking": "<think>\nI need to prove that for an acute triangle ABC, with points E and F on AC and AB respectively, satisfying BC\u00b2 = BA\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7CA, the circumcircle of triangle AEF always passes through some fixed point besides A as E and F vary.\n\nFirst, since it's an acute triangle, all angles are less than 90 degrees, which might be important for the circumcircle to be well-defined and for points to be inside, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThe condition is BC\u00b2 = BA\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7CA. BA and CA are sides, so BA is the same as AB, and CA is AC, right? I should use consistent notation. Let me denote the sides: let AB = c, BC = a, CA = b, as is standard.\n\nSo, AB = c, BC = a, CA = b.\n\nThen the condition is a\u00b2 = c\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7b.\n\nBF is part of AB, so AB is from A to B, so F is on AB, so let AF = x or something? I need to define variables.\n\nLet AF = m, so BF = AB - AF = c - m, since F is on AB.\n\nAB = c, so if F is on AB, let AF = p, then BF = c - p.\n\nSimilarly, for E on AC, AC = b, let AE = q, then CE = b - q? No.\n\nE is on AC, so from A to C. Let AE = s, then EC = AC - AE = b - b s? Better to use lengths.\n\nSet AF = x, so F is on AB, AF = x, then BF = AB - AF = c - x.\n\nSimilarly, E is on AC, let AE = y, then CE = AC - AE = b - y? AC is from A to C, so if AE = y, then E to C is AC - AE = b - y, so CE = b - y.\n\nBut in the condition, it's CE \u00b7 CA, CA is b, so CE \u00b7 b = (b - y) * b.\n\nSimilarly, BA \u00b7 BF = AB \u00b7 BF = c * (c - x).\n\nBA is the same as AB, which is c.\n\nSo condition: BC\u00b2 = BA \u00b7 BF + CE \u00b7 CA \u21d2 a\u00b2 = c * (c - x) + (b - y) * b\n\nSimplify: a\u00b2 = c(c - x) + b(b - y) = c\u00b2 - c x + b\u00b2 - b y\n\nSo a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b y - c x\n\nTherefore, b y + c x = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2\n\nFrom above: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b y - c x, so b y + c x = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2 is familiar; it's related to the law of cosines.\n\nIn triangle ABC, by law of cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A, so b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = 2 b c cos A.\n\nTherefore, b y + c x = 2 b c cos A\n\nSo we have b y + c x = 2 b c cos A\n\nNow, x and y are AF and AE, so let's keep that.\n\nThe problem is to show that the circumcircle of AEF passes through a fixed point.\n\nI need to find a point that is always on the circumcircle of A, E, F as E and F vary under this condition.\n\nSince it's a circle passing through A, and we need another fixed point, perhaps it's related to the orthic triangle or something, but the triangle is acute, so orthic triangle exists.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the fixed point is the foot of the altitude or something, but let's see.\n\nI recall that in circle geometry, if a circle passes through a fixed point and we have a condition, sometimes power of a point or radical axes can be used.\n\nBut here, the circle varies, and we need it to pass through a fixed point.\n\nSo, for different E and F satisfying the condition, the circle through A, E, F should all pass through a common point.\n\nThat means that the point should satisfy the circle equation for all such E and F.\n\nI could consider the limit or special cases.\n\nFor example, suppose E and F are chosen such that F is B or something, but let's see the condition.\n\nIf F is B, then BF = 0, so from condition a\u00b2 = BA * BF + CE * CA = c * 0 + CE * b, so a\u00b2 = b * CE, so CE = a\u00b2 / b.\n\nSince E is on AC, and CE = a\u00b2 / b, which is less than b if a < b, but not necessarily.\n\nThe triangle is acute, but sides can vary.\n\nSimilarly, if E is C, then CE = 0, so a\u00b2 = BA * BF + 0 = c * BF, so BF = a\u00b2 / c.\n\nThen F is on AB with BF = a\u00b2 / c.\n\nIn this case, when E is C, then triangle AEF is A, C, F, so points A, C, F, with F on AB.\n\nSimilarly, when F is B, points A, E, B.\n\nBut we need the circumcircle.\n\nPerhaps I can find where these circles intersect besides A.\n\nBut for different positions, it might be different.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the fixed point is related to the reflection or something.\n\nSince we have cos A involved, maybe it's the projection.\n\nLet's think in terms of vectors or coordinates.\n\nPlace the triangle in a coordinate plane.\n\nSet point A at the origin, (0,0), point B at (c,0), since AB = c.\n\nThen point C somewhere in the plane, with AC = b, BC = a.\n\nLet C be at (p,q), then distance from A: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = b\u00b2, distance from B: (p - c)\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = a\u00b2.\n\nThen from these, (p - c)\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = a\u00b2, p\u00b2 - 2 p c + c\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = a\u00b2, but p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = b\u00b2, so b\u00b2 - 2 p c + c\u00b2 = a\u00b2, so -2 p c + c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, so 2 p c = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2, so p = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2 c)\n\nSimilarly, from p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = b\u00b2, q = \u221a(b\u00b2 - p\u00b2)\n\nSince the triangle is acute, all angles less than 90,90, so p should be between 0 and c, and q >0.\n\nNow, points: A(0,0), B(c,0), C(p,q).\n\nNow, F on AB, AB is from A(0,0) to B(c,0), so let F be at (x, 0), since on x-axis, so AF = x, as before.\n\nE on AC, AC is from A(0,0) to C(p,q), so let AE = y, then E divides AC in ratio AE:EC = y : (b - y), but in terms of position vector, E is at ( (y/b) p , (y/b) q ) because from A to C, vector (p,q), length b, so unit vector (p/b, q/b), so point at distance y from A is ( (y/b) p , (y/b) q ).\n\nSimilarly, for F, it's at (x, 0).\n\nNow, the condition we had: b y + c x = 2 b c cos A\n\nWhat is cos A? Since A is at (0,0), vector AB is (c,0), vector AC is (p,q), so cos A = (AB \u00b7 AC) / (|AB| |AC|) = ( (c,0) \u00b7 (p,q) ) / (c b) = (c p + 0*q)/(c b) = p / b\n\nSince p is the x-coordinate, and |AC| = b, so cos A = p / b.\n\nSimilarly, from law of cosines, cos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2 b c), which matches p = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2 c), so cos A = p/b.\n\nNow, from condition: b y + c x = 2 b c cos A = 2 b c (p/b) = 2 c p\n\nBut p is fixed, so b y + c x = 2 c p\n\nNow, we need the circumcircle of A, E, F.\n\nPoints: A(0,0), E( (y/b) p , (y/b) q ), F(x, 0)\n\nNow, the circumcircle of these three points.\n\nSince A is at (0,0), and F is at (x,0), on x-axis.\n\nThe circle passing through A(0,0), E, F.\n\nI need to find a fixed point that lies on this circle for all x,y satisfying b y + c x = 2 c p.\n\nSince b, c, p are fixed.\n\nNow, let me denote the circle.\n\nThe general circle equation through three points.\n\nSince A and F are on x-axis, the circle equation might be simplified.\n\nLet me find the circumcircle.\n\nAssume the circle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y + F = 0\n\nSince it passes through A(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0, so F=0.\n\nSo circle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y = 0\n\nNow, it passes through F(x,0): x\u00b2 + 0 + D x + E*0 = 0, so x\u00b2 + D x = 0, so D = -x? No.\n\nF is a point, so for point F(x_f, 0), it satisfies: (x_f)^2 + 0^2 + D x_f + E*0 = 0, so (x_f)^2 + D x_f = 0\n\nSimilarly, for point E( (y/b)p , (y/b)q ), let me denote E_x = (y/b) p, E_y = (y/b) q\n\nThen E_x^2 + E_y^2 + D E_x + E E_y = 0\n\nNow, from F: (x_f)^2 + D x_f = 0, so D = -x_f? No, x_f is the coordinate, which is x in my notation, so for point F at (x, 0), we have:\n\nx^2 + 0 + D x + 0 = 0, so x^2 + D x = 0, thus D = -x\n\nD is a constant for the circle, but x is varying, so for each position, D depends on x.\n\nSimilarly, for E, with E_x and E_y depending on y.\n\nNow, the circle equation must be satisfied for the points.\n\nSince F is at (x,0), and it satisfies x^2 + D x = 0, so for that point, D must be -x, but x is the coordinate, so for each circle, D is fixed for that circle, but when we have different F, D changes.\n\nLet's think.\n\nFor a fixed E and F, the circle is determined.\n\nBut we have a relation between x and y.\n\nSo let's plug in the points.\n\nPoint A(0,0) is satisfied with F=0.\n\nPoint F(x,0): x^2 + 0 + D x + 0 = 0, so x^2 + D x = 0, which implies that D = -x, because x \u2260 0 unless F=A, but F is on AB, and if F=A, then BF = BA, so from condition, if F=A, then BF = BA = c, so a\u00b2 = BA * BF + CE * CA = c * c + CE * b = c\u00b2 + CE b, so a\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + CE b, but a, b, c are sides, so unless b=0, CE = (a\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/b, which may not be on AC, so generally F not A, similarly E not A, so x >0, so D = -x.\n\nD is the coefficient, and for each circle, when F is at (x,0), we have D = -x.\n\nSimilarly, point E: E_x = (y/b) p, E_y = (y/b) q\n\nE_x^2 + E_y^2 + D E_x + E E_y = 0\n\nSubstitute D = -x:\n\nE_x^2 + E_y^2 - x E_x + E E_y = 0\n\nBut E_x = (y/b) p, E_y = (y/b) q\n\nSo [ (y/b) p ]^2 + [ (y/b) q ]^2 - x (y/b) p + E (y/b) q = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by b^2 / y, since y>0, E not A.\n\nSo (y^2 / b^2) p^2 * (b^2 / y) + similarly, let's multiply by b^ b / y:\n\nEquation: (y^2 / b^2) p^2 + (y^2 / b^2) q^2 - x (y/b) p + E (y/b) q = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by b^2 / y:\n\n(y^2 / b^2) p^2 * (b^2 / y) = y p^2 / b^2 * b^2 / y, better:\n\nLeft side: [ (y^2 p^2)/b^2 ] + [ (y^2 q^2)/b^2 ] - x (y p)/b + E (y q)/b\n\nMultiply by b^2 / y:\n\n= (y p^2)/b * (b/y) no.\n\nTerm 1: (y^2 p^2)/b^2 * b^2 / y = y p^2\n\nSimilarly, (y^2 q^2)/b^2 * b^2 / y = y q^2\n\nTerm 3: - x (y p)/b * b^2 / y = - x (y p)/b * b^2 / y = - x p b\n\nBecause (y p)/b * b^2 / y = p b\n\nSimilarly, term 4: E (y q)/b * b^2 / y = E q b\n\nSo after multiplying by b^2 / y:\n\ny p^2 + y q^2 - x p b + E q b = 0\n\nBut p^2 + q^2 = b^2, since C(p,q), p^2 + q^2 = b^2\n\nSo y (p^2 + q^2) + E q b - x p b = 0\n\ny b^2 + E q b - x p b = 0\n\nDivide by b (b\u22600):\n\ny b + E q - x p = 0\n\nSo E q = x p - y b\n\nThus E = (x p - y b)/q\n\nNow, E is the coefficient for y in the circle equation.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y = 0 with D = -x and E = (x p - y b)/q\n\nFor each choice of x and y satisfying the condition, we have a circle.\n\nThe circle is defined, and we need to find a fixed point (s,t) such that for all x,y with b y + c x = 2 c p, the point (s,t) satisfies the circle equation.\n\nSo, for point (s,t), it should satisfy s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + D s + E t = 0 for all such circles, i.e., for all x,y with the relation.\n\nBut D and E depend on x and y.\n\nD = -x, E = (x p - y b)/q\n\nAnd the relation b y + c x = 2 c p\n\nNow, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + D s + E t = s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + [ (x p - y b)/q ] t\n\nThis must be zero for all x,y such that b y + c x = 2 c p.\n\nSince x and y are related, I can express y in terms of x or vice versa.\n\nFrom the relation: b y + c x = 2 c p, so b y = 2 c p - c x = c (2 p - x)\n\nSo y = [c (2 p - x)] / b\n\nSince b \u2260 0.\n\nNow, plug this into the expression.\n\nThe expression that must be zero:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + [ (x p - y b)/q ] t\n\nSimplify the term: (x p - y b)/q\n\nBut y b = c (2 p - x) from above, since b y = c (2 p - x)\n\nSo x p - y b = x p - c (2 p - x) = x p - 2 c p + c x = p (x - 2 c) + c x\n\nx p - y b = x p - [c (2 p - x)] = x p - 2 c p + c x = (x p + c x) - 2 c p = x (p + c) - 2 c p\n\nNot sure.\n\nx p - y b = x p - c (2 p - x) = x p - 2 c p + c x = (x p + c x) - 2 c p = x (p + c) - 2 c p\n\nStill messy.\n\nSince we have /q, and t, let's keep it.\n\nSo the expression:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + { [x p - y b] / q } t\n\nBut x p - y b = x p - c (2 p - x) as above.\n\nSet z = x p - y b\n\nThen E = z / q\n\nBut z = x p - y b = x p - c (2 p - x) = x p - 2 c p + c x = x (p + c) - 2 c p\n\nNow, the point (s,t) must satisfy:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + (z / q) t = 0\n\nBut z = x (p + c) - 2 c p\n\nSo:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + [ (x (p + c) - 2 c p) / q ] t = 0\n\nThis must hold for all x, since y is determined by x from the relation.\n\nAs x varies, this must be identically zero.\n\nSo let's write it as:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + { - s + [ (p + c) t / q ] } x - (2 c p t / q) / something, let's group constants and coefficients of x.\n\nThe expression is:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + [x (p + c) t / q] - [2 c p t / q]\n\n= [s\u00b2 + t\u00b2] + x [ -s + (p + c) t / q ] - (2 c p t / q)\n\nThis must be zero for all x, so since it's linear in x, the coefficient of x must be zero, and the constant term must be zero.\n\nBecause x can vary, so for different x, this must hold.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nCoefficient of x: -s + (p + c) t / q = 0\n\nAnd constant term: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - (2 c p t / q) = 0\n\nThe constant term is s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - (2 c p t / q)\n\nAnd this must equal zero.\n\nFrom the coefficient of x:\n\n- s + [ (p + c) t ] / q = 0\n\nSo s = [ (p + c) t ] / q\n\nNow, plug into the constant term.\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - (2 c p t / q) = 0\n\nSubstitute s:\n\n[ (p + c)^2 t^2 / q^2 ] + t^2 - (2 c p t / q) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by q^2 to simplify:\n\n(p + c)^2 t^2 + q^2 t^2 - 2 c p t q = 0\n\nFactor t, but t might be zero, if t=0, let's see.\n\nIf t=0, then from s = (p + c)t / q =0, so (0,0), but (0,0) is A, which is already on the circle, but we need another point, so t\u22600 probably.\n\nSo divide by t:\n\n(p + c)^2 t + q^2 t - 2 c p q = 0? No.\n\nEquation: (p + c)^2 t^2 + q^2 t^2 - 2 c p t q = 0\n\nSo t^2 [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ] - 2 c p q t = 0\n\nSince t\u22600, divide by t:\n\nt [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ] - 2 c p q = 0\n\nSo t = [ 2 c p q ] / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nNow, s = [ (p + c) t ] / q\n\nBut we need to find the point (s,t), which should be fixed.\n\nNow, let's simplify.\n\nFirst, t = 2 c p q / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\ns = (p + c) t / q = (p + c)/q * 2 c p q / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ] = (p + c) 2 c p / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\ns = 2 c p (p + c) / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nt = 2 c p q / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nNotice that the denominator is the same.\n\nThis point (s,t) should be fixed, but it depends on p and q, which are fixed for the triangle, so yes, fixed point.\n\nBut we need to verify that this point is indeed on the circle and is not A.\n\nFirst, let's write the denominator: (p + c)^2 + q^2\n\nNow, (p + c)^2 + q^2 = p^2 + 2 p c + c^2 + q^2\n\nBut p^2 + q^2 = b^2, so = b^2 + 2 p c + c^2\n\nFrom law of cosines, b^2 + c^2 - 2 b c cos A = a^2, but cos A = p/b, so 2 b c (p/b) = 2 c p, so b^2 + c^2 - 2 c p = a^2? Let's see.\n\nb^2 + c^2 - 2 b c cos A = b^2 + c^2 - 2 b c (p/b) = b^2 + c^2 - 2 c p\n\nAnd this equals a^2.\n\nSo b^2 + c^2 - 2 c p = a^2\n\nTherefore, denominator: b^2 + 2 p c + c^2 = (b^2 + c^2 - 2 c p) + 4 c p = a^2 + 4 c p\n\nSince b^2 + c^2 - 2 c p = a^2, so b^2 + c^2 + 2 c p = a^2 + 4 c p\n\nYes.\n\nIn our case, (p + c)^2 + q^2 = p^2 + 2 p c + c^2 + q^2 = (p^2 + q^2) + c^2 + 2 p c = b^2 + c^2 + 2 p c\n\nAnd since b^2 + c^2 - 2 p c = a^2, so b^2 + c^2 + 2 p c = a^2 + 4 p c\n\nNow, s = 2 c p (p + c) / (b^2 + c^2 + 2 p c)\n\nBut b^2 + c^2 + 2 p c = (b^2 + c^2 - 2 p c) + 4 p c = a^2 + 4 p c\n\nSimilarly, t = 2 c p q / (b^2 + c^2 + 2 p c)\n\nNow, but this seems messy. Perhaps we can interpret geometrically.\n\nNotice that in the expression, the point (s,t) might be related to the orthocenter or something.\n\nSince the circle always passes through A and this point, and we need to find what it is.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the fixed point is the reflection of H over something, but let's see.\n\nI recall that in some geometry, the point with power or something.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the fixed point is the foot of the altitude from B or something.\n\nAssume a specific triangle to find the point.\n\nSuppose ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, so b = c, and angle at A is alpha.\n\nThen since AB = AC, b = c.\n\nThen from condition, a\u00b2 = BA\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7CA = c\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7c = c (BF + CE)\n\nSince b=c.\n\nNow, BF = c - AF, CE = b - AE, but b=c, so CE = c - AE.\n\nLet AF = x, AE = y, then BF = c - x, CE = c - y.\n\nThen a\u00b2 = c ( (c - x) + (c - y) ) = c (2c - x - y)\n\nBut from law of cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A = 2 c\u00b2 - 2 c\u00b2 cos A = 2 c\u00b2 (1 - cos A)\n\nSince b=c.\n\nNow, from above, a\u00b2 = c (2c - x - y) = 2 c\u00b2 - c x - c y\n\nSet equal: 2 c\u00b2 - c x - c y = 2 c\u00b2 (1 - cos A)\n\nSo - c x - c y = 2 c (1 - cos A) - 2 c\u00b2? Let's divide by c.\n\nFrom 2 c\u00b2 - c x - c y = 2 c\u00b2 - 2 c\u00b2 cos A\n\nSo - c x - c y = -2 c\u00b2 cos A\n\nThus c x + c y = 2 c\u00b2 cos A\n\nDivide by c: x + y = 2 c cos A\n\nSince b=c.\n\nIn coordinates, place A at (0,0), B at (c,0), since AB=c.\n\nSince AB=AC, C is at (0,c) if angle at A, but AC=b=c, so if A(0,0), B(c,0), C should be such that AC=c, BC=a.\n\nSince isosceles, C is at (c/2, h) where h = \u221a(c\u00b2 - (c/2)^2) = \u221a(c\u00b2 - c\u00b2/4) = \u221a(3 c\u00b2/4) = (c \u221a3)/2 for equilateral, but not necessarily equilateral.\n\nAngle at A: cos A, then C is at (c cos A, c sin A) since AC=c.\n\nVector from A.\n\nSo A(0,0), B(c,0), C(c cos A, c sin A)\n\nThen p = c cos A, q = c sin A\n\nNow, condition x + y = 2 c cos A\n\nF at (x,0), E at (y cos A, y sin A) because AE=y, so E ( (y/c) * c cos A, (y/c) * c sin A ) earlier with b=c, so E ( y cos A, y sin A )\n\nAC from A to C: (c cos A, c sin A), so point at distance y: ( (y/c) * c cos A, (y/c) * c sin A ) = (y cos A, y sin A)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, circumcircle of A(0,0), E(y cos A, y sin A), F(x,0)\n\nCircle equation through (0,0) and (x,0), so as before, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y =0 with D= -x for point F.\n\nPoint F(x,0): x\u00b2 + 0 + D x +0=0, D= -x\n\nPoint E(y cos A, y sin A): (y cos A)^2 + (y sin A)^2 + D (y cos A) + E (y sin A) =0\n\ny\u00b2 cos\u00b2 A + y\u00b2 sin\u00b2 A + D y cos A + E y sin A =0\n\ny\u00b2 (cos\u00b2 A + sin\u00b2 A) + y (D cos A + E sin A) =0\n\ny\u00b2 + y (D cos A + E sin A) =0\n\nDivide by y: y + D cos A + E sin A =0\n\nThus E sin A = -y - D cos A\n\nBut D= -x, so E sin A = -y - (-x) cos A = -y + x cos A\n\nThus E = (x cos A - y) / sin A\n\nNow, for point (s,t) on circle: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + D s + E t =0\n\nWith D= -x, E= (x cos A - y)/sin A\n\nAnd from condition, x + y = 2 c cos A\n\nNow, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + [ (x cos A - y)/sin A ] t =0\n\nNow, y = 2 c cos A - x from the condition.\n\nPlug in:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + [ (x cos A - (2 c cos A - x) ) / sin A ] t =0\n\nSimplify inside: x cos A - 2 c cos A + x = x (cos A + 1) - 2 c cos A\n\nSo:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + { [x (cos A + 1) - 2 c cos A] / sin A } t =0\n\n= s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + x [ -s + (cos A + 1) t / sin A ] - (2 c cos A t / sin A)\n\nSet coefficient of x to zero:\n\n- s + (cos A + 1) t / sin A =0\n\nAnd constant: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - (2 c cos A t / sin A) =0\n\nFrom first: s = (cos A + 1) t / sin A\n\nPlug into second:\n\n[ (cos A + 1)^2 t^2 / sin^2 A ] + t^2 - (2 c cos A t / sin A) =0\n\nMultiply by sin^2 A:\n\n(cos A + 1)^2 t^2 + t^2 sin^2 A - 2 c cos A t sin A =0\n\nt^2 [ (cos A + 1)^2 + sin^2 A ] - 2 c cos A sin A t =0\n\nDivide by t (t\u22600):\n\nt [ (cos A + 1)^2 + sin^2 A ] - 2 c cos A sin A =0\n\n(cos A + 1)^2 + sin^2 A = cos^2 A + 2 cos A + 1 + sin^2 A = (cos^2 A + sin^2 A) + 2 cos A + 1 = 1 + 2 cos A + 1 = 2 + 2 cos A\n\nSo t (2 + 2 cos A) - 2 c cos A sin A =0\n\nt * 2 (1 + cos A) = 2 c cos A sin A\n\nThus t = [2 c cos A sin A] / [2 (1 + cos A)] = [c cos A sin A] / (1 + cos A)\n\nSimplify: sin A / (1 + cos A) = [2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)] / [2 cos^2 (A/2)] = [sin(A/2) cos(A/2)] / [cos^2 (A/2)] = sin(A/2) / cos(A/2) = tan(A/2)\n\nThus t = c cos A * tan(A/2)\n\nBut cos A = 2 cos^2 (A/2) - 1 = 1 - 2 sin^2 (A/2), better use identities.\n\nt = c cos A * [sin A / (1 + cos A)] / 1? From above:\n\nt = [c cos A sin A] / (1 + cos A)\n\nAnd sin A / (1 + cos A) = tan(A/2) as above.\n\nSo t = c cos A tan(A/2)\n\nBut cos A = 2 cos^2 (A/2) - 1, and tan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2), so t = c (2 cos^2 (A/2) - 1) (sin(A/2)/cos(A/2)) = c (2 cos(A/2) sin(A/2) - sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) * cos(A/2)) messy.\n\nt = c cos A tan(A/2)\n\nSimilarly, but in coordinates, what is this point.\n\ns = (cos A + 1) t / sin A\n\nFrom above.\n\nFor the fixed point, in this isosceles case.\n\nBut we need the general case.\n\nBack to the general case.\n\nWe had s and t.\n\ns = 2 c p (p + c) / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nt = 2 c p q / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nDenominator (p + c)^2 + q^2\n\nNow, (p + c, q) is the vector from B to C? B is at (c,0), C is at (p,q), so vector from B to C is (p - c, q)\n\nBut here we have (p + c, q), which is like from (-c,0) to C or something.\n\nPoint (-c, 0) is on the x-axis, left of A.\n\nA at (0,0), B at (c,0), so (-c,0) is symmetric to B with respect to A.\n\nThen (p + c, q) is vector from (-c,0) to C(p,q), since (p,q) - (-c,0) = (p+c, q)\n\nSo the point (s,t) = [ 2 c p (p+c) / D , 2 c p q / D ] where D = (p+c)^2 + q^2\n\nBut 2 c p (p+c) / D and 2 c p q / D, this is like a scaling.\n\nNotice that (s,t) = k * (p+c, q) for some k? s / (p+c) = 2 c p / D, t / q = 2 c p / D, so yes, s / (p+c) = t / q = 2 c p / D\n\nThus the point (s,t) is on the line from (0,0) to (p+c, q), which is the point from (-c,0) to C.\n\nThe vector (p+c, q) is fixed.\n\nThe point is proportional to (p+c, q) with factor 2 c p / D.\n\nBut D = (p+c)^2 + q^2, which is the square of distance from (-c,0) to C.\n\nLet P be the point (-c, 0), which is the reflection of B over A, since A is (0,0), B is (c,0), so P is (-c,0).\n\nThen distance PC: from P(-c,0) to C(p,q) is sqrt( (p+c)^2 + q^2 )\n\nThen (s,t) = [2 c p / PC^2] * (p+c, q) = [2 c p / PC^2] * vector PC\n\nBut p is the x-coordinate of C, which is b cos A.\n\ncos A = p/b, so p = b cos A.\n\nSimilarly, q = b sin A.\n\nIn general, without coordinates.\n\nThe fixed point we found.\n\nIn the circle of AEF, it passes through (s,t).\n\nBut we need to identify this point geometrically.\n\nNotice that in the expression, s and t.\n\nSince b y + c x = 2 b c cos A, and from the circle condition.\n\nAnother idea: the condition BC^2 = BA\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7CA resembles the power or something.\n\nBC^2 is power of B with respect to some circle? Not sure.\n\nPerhaps the circle is related to the Apollonius circle or something.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the locus or something.\n\nPerhaps the fixed point is the orthocenter.\n\nIn acute triangle, orthocenter exists.\n\nLet H be the orthocenter.\n\nIn coordinate, with A(0,0), B(c,0), C(p,q), the orthocenter.\n\nFirst, altitude from A: since A is at (0,0), and AB is x-axis, but AB may not be base.\n\nFind orthocenter.\n\nSince A(0,0), B(c,0), C(p,q).\n\nAltitude from C to AB: since AB is x-axis, horizontal, so altitude is vertical? AB is from (0,0) to (c,0), so it is horizontal, so perpendicular is vertical only if, no, AB is along x-axis, so perpendicular from C to AB is vertical only if AB is horizontal, which it is, so foot is (p,0)? C is (p,q), AB is x-axis, so foot of perpendicular from C to AB is (p,0), which is on AB.\n\nThen altitude from C is the line x = p.\n\nNow, altitude from A: A to BC.\n\nFirst, find equation of BC.\n\nB(c,0), C(p,q), so slope of BC is (q-0)/(p-c) = q/(p-c)\n\nSo perpendicular slope is - (p-c)/q\n\nThus altitude from A(0,0) has slope - (p-c)/q, so equation y = [ - (p-c)/q ] x\n\nNow, orthocenter is intersection of altitudes, say from C and from A.\n\nAltitude from C: x = p\n\nAltitude from A: y = [ - (p-c)/q ] x\n\nAt x=p, y = [ - (p-c)/q ] p = - p (p-c)/q\n\nSo H is at ( p, - p (p-c)/q )\n\nNow, compare to our (s,t).\n\ns = 2 c p (p + c) / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nt = 2 c p q / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nNot obviously the same.\n\nPerhaps in vector terms.\n\nAnother point: the reflection of H or something.\n\nPerhaps it's the point related to the circle.\n\nSince the circumcircle of AEF passes through a fixed point, and A is fixed, perhaps that point is the second intersection with another circle.\n\nBut we have the condition.\n\nFrom the beginning, we have b y + c x = 2 b c cos A\n\nx is AF, y is AE.\n\nIn the circle of AEF, the point.\n\nPerhaps the fixed point is the projection or something.\n\nLet's assume a specific triangle.\n\nSuppose ABC is equilateral, so a=b=c, and angles 60 degrees.\n\nThen cos A = cos 60 = 1/2.\n\nThen condition: a\u00b2 = BA\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7CA = a\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7a = a (BF + CE)\n\nSince BA = CA = a.\n\nSo a\u00b2 = a (BF + CE), so BF + CE = a.\n\nBut BF = AB - AF = a - x, CE = AC - AE = a - y, so (a - x) + (a - y) = 2a - x - y = a, so x + y = a.\n\nNow, A(0,0), B(a,0), C(a/2, (a\u221a3)/2)\n\nThen x + y = a.\n\nF at (x,0), E at, since AC from A(0,0) to C(a/2, (a\u221a3)/2), so E at ( (y/a) * a/2 , (y/a) * (a\u221a3)/2 ) = ( y/2 , y \u221a3 / 2 )\n\nBecause vector C: (a/2, (a\u221a3)/2), so unit, point at dist y: (y/2, y \u221a3 / 2)\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow circumcircle of A(0,0), E(y/2, y \u221a3 / 2), F(x,0)\n\nCircle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y =0\n\nThrough F(x,0): x\u00b2 + D x =0, D= -x\n\nThrough E(y/2, y \u221a3 / 2): (y/2)^2 + (y \u221a3 / 2)^2 + D (y/2) + E (y \u221a3 / 2) =0\n\ny\u00b2/4 + 3 y\u00b2/4 + D y/2 + E y \u221a3 / 2 =0\n\ny\u00b2 + (D/2 + E \u221a3 / 2) y =0\n\nDivide by y: y + D/2 + E \u221a3 / 2 =0\n\nSo E \u221a3 / 2 = -y - D/2\n\nD= -x, so E \u221a3 / 2 = -y - (-x)/2 = -y + x/2\n\nThus E \u221a3 / 2 = x/2 - y\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: E \u221a3 = x - 2 y\n\nSo E = (x - 2 y)/\u221a3\n\nNow, for point (s,t): s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + D s + E t =0\n\nD= -x, E= (x - 2 y)/\u221a3\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + [ (x - 2 y)/\u221a3 ] t =0\n\nNow x + y = a, so y = a - x\n\nPlug in:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + [ (x - 2(a - x) )/\u221a3 ] t =0\n\nx - 2a + 2x = 3x - 2a\n\nSo [ (3x - 2a)/\u221a3 ] t\n\nThus:\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - x s + (3x - 2a)/\u221a3 t =0\n\n= s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + x [ -s + (3t)/\u221a3 ] - (2a t)/\u221a3\n\n= s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + x [ -s + \u221a3 t ] - (2a t)/\u221a3\n\nSet coefficient of x to zero: -s + \u221a3 t =0, so s = \u221a3 t\n\nThen constant: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - (2a t)/\u221a3 =0\n\nBut s = \u221a3 t, so (3 t^2) + t^2 - (2a t)/\u221a3 =0\n\n4 t^2 - (2a t)/\u221a3 =0\n\nDivide by 2t (t\u22600): 2 t - a/\u221a3 =0, so t = a/(2 \u221a3) = a \u221a3 / 6\n\nThen s = \u221a3 * a \u221a3 / 6 = 3 a / 6 = a/2\n\ns = a/2, t = a \u221a3 / 6\n\nNow, a/2, a \u221a3 / 6, which is the centroid? Centroid has y-coordinate (0 + 0 + (a\u221a3)/2)/3 = (a\u221a3)/6, and x-coordinate (0 + a + a/2)/3 = (3a/2)/3 = a/2, yes, so in equilateral, centroid, orthocenter, all coincide.\n\nAnd a/2, a \u221a3 / 6 is indeed the centroid, which is fixed.\n\nIn general acute triangle, it might be the orthocenter.\n\nIn the general coordinate, we had s and t.\n\nWith C(p,q), s = 2 c p (p + c) / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nt = 2 c p q / [ (p + c)^2 + q^2 ]\n\nNow, orthocenter we had at ( p, - p (p-c)/q )\n\nNot the same.\n\nFor example in equilateral, p = a/2, q = (a\u221a3)/2, c=a\n\nThen s = 2 a (a/2) (a/2 + a) / [ (a/2 + a)^2 + ( (a\u221a3)/2 )^2 ] = 2 a (a/2) (3a/2) / [ (3a/2)^2 + 3a^2/4 ] = 2 a (3a^2/4) / [ 9a^2/4 + 3a^2/4 ] = (6 a^3 / 4) / (12 a^2 / 4) = (6 a^3 / 4) * (4 / 12 a^2) = (6 a^3) / (12 a^2) = a/2\n\nSimilarly t = 2 a (a/2) ( (a\u221a3)/2 ) / [ (3a/2)^2 + ( (a\u221a3)/2 )^2 ] = 2 a (a/2) (a\u221a3/2) / [ 9a^2/4 + 3a^2/4 ] = 2 a ( a^2 \u221a3 / 4 ) / (12 a^2 / 4) = (2 a * a^2 \u221a3 / 4) * (4 / 12 a^2) = (2 a^3 \u221a3 / 4) / (12 a^2 / 4) better: numerator 2 a * a^2 \u221a3 / 4 = a^3 \u221a3 / 2? 2 * 1/4 = 1/2, so (1/2) a^3 \u221a3\n\nDenominator: 12 a^2 / 4 = 3 a^2\n\nSo t = (1/2 a^3 \u221a3) / (3 a^2) = (1/2 \u221a3 a) / 3 = (\u221a3 a)/6\n\nYes, as before.\n\nNow in general, orthocenter at (p, -p (p-c)/q)\n\nBut our point is at (s,t) with s = 2 c p (p+c) / D, t = 2 c p q / D, D= (p+c)^2 + q^2\n\nSince D = (p+c)^2 + q^2, and vector.\n\nPerhaps this point is the inverse or something.\n\nNotice that the vector from P(-c,0) to C(p,q) is (p+c, q), and the point is [2 c p / |PC|^2] times that vector from P, but from origin.\n\n(s,t) = [2 c p / D] * (p+c, q)\n\nBut 2 c p / D, not constant.\n\nAnother point: the foot of the altitude or something.\n\nIn the condition, we have cos A, so perhaps the fixed point is the projection of A on the altitude or something.\n\nI recall that in some geometry, the circle with diameter or something.\n\nPerhaps the fixed point is the point where the circle meets BC or something, but not necessarily.\n\nAnother idea: since BC^2 = BA\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7CA, and BA and CA are fixed, BF and BF vary.\n\nCE varies.\n\nThis looks like the condition for the circle to be tangent or something, but not.\n\nPerhaps it's related to the power of point B and C.\n\nFor example, from B, power with respect to circle AEF.\n\nBut circle AEF has points A,E,F.\n\nPower of B: since F on AB, and A on circle, so BF * BA, but BA is fixed, BF varies.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nPerhaps the fixed point is on the altitude.\n\nLet's assume the orthocenter.\n\nIn the equilateral case it worked, but in general.\n\nTake a right triangle, but the triangle is acute, so all angles acute.\n\nSuppose a 40-60-80 or something, but messy.\n\nFrom the coordinate, we have the point, and it must be the fixed point, so in the proof, we can say that we found a point, and it satisfies for all, so it must be fixed.\n\nBut we need to identify it.\n\nNotice that in the expression for t, t = 2 c p q / D\n\nBut p = b cos A, q = b sin A, c is AB.\n\nD = (p+c)^2 + q^2 = (b cos A + c)^2 + (b sin A)^2 = b^2 cos^2 A + 2 b c cos A + c^2 + b^2 sin^2 A = b^2 (cos^2 A + sin^2 A) + 2 b c cos A + c^2 = b^2 + 2 b c cos A + c^2\n\nNow, by law of cosines, a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2 b c cos A, so b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 2 b c cos A\n\nBut here D = b^2 + 2 b c cos A + c^2 = (b^2 + c^2 - 2 b c cos A) + 4 b c cos A = a^2 + 4 b c cos A\n\nSince b^2 + c^2 - 2 b c cos A = a^2.\n\nNow s = 2 c p (p+c) / D = 2 c (b cos A) (b cos A + c) / D\n\nBut b cos A + c, and D.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThe point (s,t) = ( 2 c b cos A (b cos A + c) / D , 2 c b cos A b sin A / D ) = ( 2 b c cos A (b cos A + c) / D , 2 b c cos A b sin A / D )\n\nBut b c cos A is common, but D has it.\n\nPerhaps divide.\n\nThe ratio s/t = [2 b c cos A (b cos A + c)/D] / [2 b c cos A b sin A /D] = (b cos A + c)/(b sin A) = (b cos A)/(b sin A) + c/(b sin A) = cot A + c/(b sin A)\n\nNot nice.\n\nSince the circle passes through A and this point, and for different E and F, it should be fixed, so in the proof, we can define the point and show it's on the circle.\n\nBut to be thorough.\n\nAnother thought: the condition BC^2 = BA\u00b7BF + CE\u00b7CA can be written as a^2 = c (c - AF) + b (b - AE) = c^2 - c AF + b^2 - b AE\n\nSo a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - b AE - c AF\n\nBut b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 2 b c cos A\n\nSo b AE + c AF = 2 b c cos A\n\nAE and AF are distances from A.\n\nIn the circle of AEF, with A fixed, and E and F varying, but with AE and AF related by b AE + c AF = 2 b c cos A.\n\nThe fixed point might be related to the angle or something.\n\nPerhaps the point is the intersection of the circle with the altitude from A.\n\nLet's assume that the fixed point is H, the orthocenter.\n\nThen in the circle of AEF, it should be on it.\n\nBut from the coordinate, in general it's not, unless in isosceles.\n\nFor example, take a specific triangle.\n\nSuppose A(0,0), B(4,0), C(1,2), so AB=4, AC=\u221a(1+4)=\u221a5, BC=\u221a( (4-1)^2 + (0-2)^2 ) = \u221a(9+4)=\u221a13\n\nAngles: at A, vectors AB (4,0), AC (1,2), dot product 4*1 +0*2=4, |AB|=4, |AC|=\u221a5, so cos A = 4/(4 \u221a5) = 1/\u221a5\n\nThen p=1, q=2, c=4\n\nThen condition: b y + c x = 2 b c cos A\n\nb=\u221a5, c=4, cos A=1/\u221a5\n\nSo \u221a5 y + 4 x = 2 * \u221a5 * 4 * (1/\u221a5) = 2*4*1 = 8\n\nSo \u221a5 y + 4 x = 8\n\nNow, for example, let x=1, then 4*1 + \u221a5 y =8, \u221a5 y=4, y=4/\u221a5\n\nThen E at ( (y/b) p , (y/b) q ) = ( (4/\u221a5)/\u221a5 *1 , (4/\u221a5)/\u221a5 *2 ) = (4/5 *1, 4/5 *2) = (0.8, 1.6)\n\nb=\u221a5, y=4/\u221a5, so y/b = (4/\u221a5)/\u221a5 = 4/5\n\nE: ( (4/5)*1, (4/5)*2 ) = (0.8, 1.6)\n\nF at (x,0)=(1,0)\n\nA(0,0)\n\nCircle through (0,0), (0.8,1.6), (1,0)\n\nEquation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y =0\n\nThrough (1,0): 1 + 0 + D*1 +0=0, so D= -1\n\nThrough (0.8,8,1.6): (0.8)^2 + (1.6)^2 + D*0.8 + E*1.6 =0\n\n0.64 + 2.56 + (-1)(0.8) + E*1.6 =0\n\n3.2 - 0.8 + 1.6 E =0\n\n2.4 + 1.6 E =0\n\n1.6 E = -2.4\n\nE = -2.4 / 1.6 = -24/16 = -3/2 = -1.5\n\nSo circle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - x - 1.5 y =0\n\nNow, fixed point from formula.\n\nFirst, D = (p+c)^2 + q^2 = (1+4)^2 + 2^2 = 25 + 4 = 29\n\ns = 2 c p (p+c)/D = 2*4*1*(1+4)/29 = 8*5/29 = 40/29\n\nt = 2 c p q /D = 2*4*1*2/29 = 16/29\n\nNow, check if (40/29, 16/29) on circle: (40/29)^2 + (16/29)^2 - (40/29) - 1.5*(16/29)\n\nCompute: 1.5=3/2, so - (3/2)(16/29) = -48/58 = -24/29\n\nBetter common denominator 29.\n\n(40/29)^2 = 1600/841\n\n(16/29)^2 = 256/841\n\nSum: 1856/841\n\n-40/29 = -40*29/841? 29*29=841, so -40/29 = -40*29/841? No.\n\n-40/29 = -40/29 * 29/29? To denominator 841, -40/29 = -40 * 29 / (29*29) = -1160/841? No.\n\nFraction: a/b to denominator d, multiply num and denom by d/b.\n\n841 = 29^2.\n\nSo -40/29 = -40/29 * 29/29? No: to write with denom 841, since 841 = 29*29, so -40/29 = -40 * 29 / (29*29) * 1/29? Messy mess.\n\n-40/29 = -40 * 29 / 841? No: 1/29 = 29/841? 1/29 = 29/841? 29/841 = 29/(29*29) = 1/29, yes.\n\nSo -40/29 = -40 * (1/29) = -40 * (29/841) / 29? No.\n\n1/29 = 29/841? 29/841 = 29/(29*29) = 1/29, so 1/29 = 29/841? 29/841 = 1/29, yes.\n\nBut we have -40/29, so -40/29 = -40 * (1/29) = -40 * (29/841) / 1? 1/29 = 29/841 is wrong.\n\n29/841 = 29/(29*29) = 1/29, so 1/29 = 29/841? No: 1/29 = 1/29, and 29/841 = 29/(29*29) = 1/29, so yes, 1/29 = 29/841? 29/841 = 1/29, so 1/29 = 1/29, but to write with denominator 841, 1/29 = 29/841? 29/841 = 1/29, yes, but 29/841 is 1/29, so for -40/29, it is -40 * (1/29) = -40 * (29/841) / 29? I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me set denom 841.\n\n29 * 29 = 841.\n\nSo -40/29 = -40 * 29 / 841? No: to change denominator, -40/29 = -40 * (29) / (29*29) * (1/29)? Better: multiply numerator and denominator by 29: -40/29 = (-40 * 29) / (29*29) = -1160/841\n\nSimilarly, -1.5 * 16/29 = - (3/2) * 16/29 = -48/58 = -24/29, and -24/29 = -24*29/841 = -696/841\n\nNow, s^2 + t^2 = (40/29)^2 + (16/29)^2 = 1600/841 + 256/841 = 1856/841\n\nThen s^2 + t^2 - s - 1.5 t = 1856/841 - 1160/841 - 696/841 = (1856 - 1160 - 696)/841\n\nCompute 1856 - 1160 = 696, then 696 - 696 =0, so yes, 0.\n\nSo (s,t) is on the circle.\n\nNow, what is this point? In this case, orthocenter.\n\nC(1,2), B(4,0), A(0,0)\n\nSlope of BC: (2-0)/(1-4) = 2/-3 = -2/3\n\nPerpendicular slope 3/2\n\nAltitude from A to BC: from (0,0), slope 3/2, equation y = (3/2)x\n\nAltitude from C to AB: AB x-axis, so x=1\n\nAt x=1, y= (3/2)(1) = 1.5, so H(1,1.5) = (1, 3/2)\n\nBut our (s,t) = (40/29, 16/29) \u2248 (1.379, 0.551), not (1,1.5), so not orthocenter.\n\nWhat is (1.379,0.551)? In the triangle.\n\nPerhaps it's a different point.\n\nAnother point: the fixed point from formula.\n\nBut in the proof, since we derived it, and it works, we can state that it is fixed.\n\nTo identify, let's see the vector.\n\nIn general, the point (s,t) with s and t as above.\n\nSince the circle passes through A and this point, and for the circumcircle of AEF, with the condition, it always passes through this fixed point.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"passes through a fixed point other than A\", which we have, since in general t= 2 c p q / D, q>0, so not A.\n\nSo in the proof, we can conclude.\n\nBut to write the proof nicely.\n",

We are looking for a point other than \\(A\\), so we must have \\(y_K \\neq 0\\).\nFrom (1): \\(x_K \\sin A = \\frac{b\\cos A+c}{b} y_K\\).\nSo \\(x_K = \\frac{b\\cos A+c}{b\\sin A} y_K\\). (Equation 1')\nFrom (2), since \\(y_K \\neq 0\\), we can divide by \\(y_K\\):\n\\(\\frac{x_K^2+y_K^2}{y_K} \\sin A - 2c\\cos A = 0\\), so \\(x_K^2+y_K^2 = \\frac{2c\\cos A}{\\sin A} y_K\\). (Equation 2')\nSubstitute \\(x_K\\) from (1') into (2'):\n\\(\\left(\\frac{b\\cos A+c}{b\\sin A}\\right)^2 y_K^2 + y_K^2 = \\frac{2c\\cos A}{\\sin A} y_K\\).\nSince \\(y_K \\neq 0\\), divide by \\(y_K\\):\n\\(\\left[\\left(\\frac{b\\cos A+c}{b\\sin A}\\right)^2 + 1\\right] y_K = \\frac{2c\\cos A}{\\sin A}\\).\n\\(\\left[\\frac{(b\\cos A+c)^2 + (b\\sin A)^2}{(b\\sin A)^2}\\right] y_K = \\frac{2c\\cos A}{\\sin A}\\).\nThe numerator of the fraction in the square brackets is:\n\\((b\\cos A+c)^2 + (b\\sin A)^2 = b^2\\cos^2 A + 2bc\\cos A + c^2 + b^2\\sin^2 A = b^2(\\cos^2 A+\\sin^2 A) + c^2 + 2bc\\cos A = b^2+c^2+2bc\\cos A\\).\nSo, \\(\\frac{b^2+c^2+2bc\\cos A}{b^2\\sin^2 A} y_K = \\frac{2c\\cos A}{\\sin A}\\).\nSince \\(A \\in (0, \\pi/2)\\), \\(\\sin A \\neq 0\\). We can multiply by \\(\\sin A\\).\n\\(\\frac{b^2+c^2+2bc\\cos A}{b^2\\sin A} y_K = 2c\\cos A\\).\nAs \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is acute, \\(A, B, C \\in (0, \\pi/2)\\). Thus \\(\\cos A > 0\\).\nAlso, \\(b^2+c^2+2bc\\cos A > 0\\).\nSo, \\(y_K = \\frac{2c\\cos A \\cdot b^2\\sin A}{b^2+c^2+2bc\\cos A} = \\frac{2b^2c\\sin A\\cos A}{b^2+c^2+2bc\\cos A}\\).\nNow substitute \\(y_K\\) into Equation 1' to find \\(x_K\\):\n\\(x_K = \\frac{b\\cos A+c}{b\\sin A} y_K = \\frac{b\\cos A+c}{b\\sin A} \\cdot \\frac{2b^2c\\sin A\\cos A}{b^2+c^2+2bc\\cos A}\\).\n\\(x_K = \\frac{(b\\cos A+c)2bc\\cos A}{b^2+c^2+2bc\\cos A}\\).\nThe coordinates \\((x_K, y_K)\\) are uniquely determined by the side lengths \\(b,c\\) and the angle \\(A\\) of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\nThus, \\(K=(x_K, y_K)\\) is a fixed point. Since \\(y_K \\neq 0\\) (because \\(\\cos A > 0, \\sin A > 0, b,c > 0\\)), this point \\(K\\) is distinct from \\(A\\).\n\nThe range of permissible values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) needs to allow for \\(E,F\\) to be \"variable\". The condition \\(cx+by = 2bc \\cos A\\) defines a line in the \\(xy\\)-plane. The constraints \\(0 \\le x \\le c\\) and \\(0 \\le y \\le b\\) define a rectangle. The intersection of this line and rectangle is a line segment. As long as this segment is not a single point, there are infinitely many pairs \\((x,y)\\) satisfying the condition, and the argument that the coefficients in the polynomial in \\(x\\) must be zero holds. The problem states \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) vary, which implies the segment is not a point.\n\nTherefore, the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle AEF\\) passes through a fixed point \\(K\\) (with coordinates derived above) other than \\(A\\).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{The circumcircle of \\triangle AEF passes through a fixed point other than A}$.",

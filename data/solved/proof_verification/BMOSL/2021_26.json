            "solution": "Solution 1. We will show that that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. It is easy to check that this function satisfies the equation.\n\nWe write $P(x, y)$ for the assertion that $f(x f(x+y))=y f(x)+1$.\nWe first show that $f$ is injective. So assume $f\\left(x_{1}\\right)=f\\left(x_{2}\\right)$ and take any $x<x_{1}, x_{2}$. Then $P\\left(x, x_{1}-x\\right)$ and $P\\left(x, x_{2}-x\\right)$ give\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{1}-x\\right) f(x)+1=f\\left(x f\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(x f\\left(x_{2}\\right)\\right)=\\left(x_{2}-x\\right) f(x)+1\n$$\ngiving $x_{1}=x_{2}$.\nIt is also immediate that for every $z>1$ there is an $x$ such that $f(x)=z$. Indeed $P\\left(x, \\frac{z-1}{f(x)}\\right)$ gives that\n$$\nf\\left(x f\\left(x+\\frac{z-1}{f(x)}\\right)\\right)=z .\n$$\n\nNow given $z>1$, take $x$ such that $f(x)=z$. Then $P\\left(x, \\frac{z-1}{z}\\right)$ gives\n\n$$\nf\\left(x f\\left(x+\\frac{z-1}{z}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{z-1}{z} f(x)+1=z=f(x) .\n$$\n\nSince $f$ is injective, we deduce that $f\\left(x+\\frac{z-1}{z}\\right)=1$.\nSo there is a $k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$such that $f(k)=1$. Since $f$ is injective this $k$ is unique. Therefore $x=k+\\frac{1}{z}-1$. I.e. for every $z>1$ we have\n\n$$\nf\\left(k+\\frac{1}{z}-1\\right)=z\n$$\n\nWe must have $k+\\frac{1}{z}-1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$for each $z>1$ and taking the limit as $z$ tends to infinity we deduce that $k \\geqslant 1$. (Without mentioning limits, assuming for contradiction that $k<1$, taking $z=\\frac{2}{1-k}$ leads to a contradiction.) Set $r=k-1$.\n\nNow $P\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right)$ gives\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}\\right) f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{1}{3} f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}\\right)+1=\\frac{6}{3}+1=3=f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{3}\\right) .\n$$\n\nBut\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}\\right) f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}\\right) f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(2 r+\\frac{1}{3}\\right) .\n$$\n\nThe injectivity of $f$ now shows that $r=0$, i.e. that $f(1)=k=1$.\nThis shows that $f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)=z$ for every $z>1$, i.e. $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$ for every $x<1$. Now for $x>1$ consider $P(1, x-1)$ to get $f(f(x))=(x-1) f(1)+1=x=f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$. Injectivity of $f$ shows that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$.\nSo for all possible values of $x$ we have shown that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nSolution 2. $P(1, y)$ shows that $f(f(y+1))=y f(1)+1$. Now $P\\left(f(y+1), \\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1}\\right)$ shows that\n\n$$\nf\\left(f(y+1) f\\left(f(y+1)+\\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1} f(f(y+1))+1=y f(1)+1\n$$\n\nSince $f$ is injective (as in Solution 1) we get that\n\n$$\nf(y+1) f\\left(f(y+1)+\\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1}\\right)=f(y+1)\n$$\nand therefore there is a unique $k$ such that $f(k)=1$. Furtermore, for every $y>0$ we have\n$$\nf(y+1)=k-\\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1}\n$$\n\nThe right hand side of (1) is always positive. But letting $y$ tend to infinity, the right hand side tends to $k-1$ so we must have $k \\geqslant 1$.\n\nIf $k>1$, then $P(k-1,1)$ gives\n\n$$\nf(k-1)=f((k-1) f(k))=f(k-1)+1\n$$\na contradiction. So $f(1)=k=1$.\nFor $x<1, P(x, 1-x)$ gives\n$$\nf(x)=f(x f(x+(1-x)))=(1-x) f(x)+1\n$$\n\nfrom which we deduce that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$. To show that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$ for $x>1$ we can either work as in Solution $1$ or take $y=x-1$ in (1) to get that\n\n$$\nf(x)=1-\\frac{x-1}{(x-1)+1}=\\frac{1}{x}\n$$",

The term \\(f(x)\\) is positive since the codomain of \\(f\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\).\nAs \\(y\\) varies over \\(\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), the right hand side (RHS) \\(y f(x)+1\\) takes values in \\((1, \\infty)\\).\nLet \\(S = \\{x f(x+y) : x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\}\\). This set \\(S\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\) because \\(x>0\\) and \\(f(x+y)>0\\).\nThe equation \\((*)\\) tells us that for any \\(z \\in S\\), \\(f(z) \\in (1, \\infty)\\). That is, \\(f(z) > 1\\) for all \\(z \\in S\\).\nThe set of values \\(\\{f(u) : u \\in S \\}\\) is exactly \\((1, \\infty)\\). This means that \\((1, \\infty)\\) is a subset of the range of \\(f\\). So, \\(\\mathrm{range}(f) \\supseteq (1, \\infty)\\). Since \\(\\mathrm{range}(f) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^+\\), this means the range of \\(f\\) can additionally include values in \\((0,1]\\).\n\nStep 2: Show that \\(f\\) is injective.\nLet \\(x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\) be fixed. Suppose for some \\(y_1, y_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), we have \\(f(x_0+y_1) = f(x_0+y_2)\\). Let this common value be \\(A\\).\nFrom \\((*)\\), we have:\nFor \\(y_1\\): \\(f(x_0 A) = y_1 f(x_0)+1\\).\nFor \\(y_2\\): \\(f(x_0 A) = y_2 f(x_0)+1\\).\nThus, \\(y_1 f(x_0)+1 = y_2 f(x_0)+1\\), which implies \\(y_1 f(x_0) = y_2 f(x_0)\\).\nSince \\(x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), \\(f(x_0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), so \\(f(x_0)>0\\). We can divide by \\(f(x_0)\\) to get \\(y_1=y_2\\).\nThis implies \\(x_0+y_1 = x_0+y_2\\).\nSo, for any fixed \\(x_0\\), the function \\(y \\mapsto f(x_0+y)\\) is injective. This means that \\(f\\) restricted to the interval \\((x_0, \\infty)\\) is injective.\nSince \\(x_0\\) can be any arbitrarily small positive number, this means \\(f\\) is injective on \\(\\bigcup_{x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^+} (x_0, \\infty) = \\mathbb{R}^+\\).\nTherefore, \\(f\\) is an injective function on \\(\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\).\n\nStep 3: Determine the monotonicity of \\(f\\).\nSince \\(f\\) is injective and its domain \\(\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\) is an interval, \\(f\\) must be strictly monotone.\n\nStep 4: Determine the range of \\(f\\).\nSince \\(f\\) is strictly monotone and its domain \\(\\mathbb{R}^+\\) is an interval \\((0, \\infty)\\), its range \\(\\mathrm{range}(f)\\) must be an interval.\nLet's denote \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x)\\) by \\(L_0\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)\\) by \\(L_\\infty\\). These limits exist, possibly being \\(0\\) or \\(\\infty\\).\nThe range of \\(f\\) is an interval defined by these limits. Specifically, if \\(f\\) is strictly increasing, \\(\\mathrm{range}(f) = (L_0, L_\\infty)\\). If \\(f\\) is strictly decreasing, \\(\\mathrm{range}(f) = (L_\\infty, L_0)\\).\n\nCase 1: \\(f\\) is strictly increasing.\nThen \\(L_0 < L_\\infty\\). The range is \\((L_0, L_\\infty)\\).\nWe know \\((1, \\infty) \\subseteq \\mathrm{range}(f)\\). So \\((1, \\infty) \\subseteq (L_0, L_\\infty)\\).\nThis implies \\(L_0 \\le 1\\) and \\(L_\\infty = \\infty\\). So the range of \\(f\\) is \\((L_0, \\infty)\\) where \\(L_0 \\le 1\\).\nIf \\(L_\\infty\\) were finite, say \\(M\\), then \\(f(x f(x+y)) = y f(x)+1\\) would imply \\(M \\approx y f(x)+1\\). But \\(f(x)\\) would approach \\(M\\), so \\(M \\approx yM+1\\), which implies \\(M(1-y) \\approx 1\\). This cannot hold for all \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\). So \\(L_\\infty = \\infty\\).\n\nCase 2: \\(f\\) is strictly decreasing.\nThen \\(L_0 > L_\\infty\\). The range is \\((L_\\infty, L_0)\\).\nWe know \\((1, \\infty) \\subseteq \\mathrm{range}(f)\\). So \\((1, \\infty) \\subseteq (L_\\infty, L_0)\\).\nThis implies \\(L_\\infty \\le 1\\) and \\(L_0 = \\infty\\). So the range of \\(f\\) is \\((L_\\infty, \\infty)\\).\nConsider the original equation \\(f(x f(x+y))=y f(x)+1\\).\nLet \\(y \\to \\infty\\). Then \\(y f(x)+1 \\to \\infty\\) (since \\(f(x)>0\\)).\nSo \\(f(x f(x+y))\\) must take arbitrarily large values.\nSince \\(f\\) is decreasing, its argument \\(x f(x+y)\\) must take values arbitrarily close to \\(L_\\infty\\) (if argument tends to infinity) or to 0 (if argument tends to \\(L_0=\\infty\\)).\nThe term \\(x+y \\to \\infty\\) as \\(y \\to \\infty\\). So \\(f(x+y) \\to L_\\infty\\).\nThe argument \\(x f(x+y) \\to x L_\\infty\\).\nThen \\(f(x f(x+y)) \\to f(x L_\\infty)\\) (assuming \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x L_\\infty\\)).\nThis means \\(f(x L_\\infty)\\) must be \\(\\infty\\). This implies \\(x L_\\infty = L_\\infty\\) (if \\(f(z) \\to \\infty \\iff z \\to L_\\infty\\)). No, this should be \\(xL_\\infty = 0\\) if \\(L_0=\\infty\\).\nIf \\(L_\\infty > 0\\), then \\(f(x f(x+y)) \\to f(x L_\\infty)\\). The RHS \\(y f(x)+1 \\to \\infty\\). So \\(f(x L_\\infty) = \\infty\\). This implies \\(x L_\\infty = 0\\) (as \\(f(z) \\to \\infty\\) only when \\(z \\to 0^+\\) for a decreasing function whose range includes large values). As \\(x>0\\), this implies \\(L_\\infty=0\\).\nSo, if \\(f\\) is strictly decreasing, then \\(L_\\infty = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = 0\\).\nThe range of \\(f\\) is \\((0, L_0)\\). Since \\((1, \\infty) \\subseteq (0, L_0)\\), we must have \\(L_0=\\infty\\).\nThus, if \\(f\\) is decreasing, its range is \\((0,\\infty)\\).\nIf \\(f\\) is increasing, its range is \\((L_0, \\infty)\\) with \\(0 \\le L_0 \\le 1\\).\n\nIn both cases, the range of \\(f\\) is an interval: \\((0,\\infty)\\) if decreasing, or \\((L_0, \\infty)\\) with \\(L_0 \\le 1\\) if increasing.\n\nStep 5: Show that \\(f\\) is continuous.\nA strictly monotone function whose domain is an interval and whose range is an interval must be continuous.\nSince \\(f\\) is strictly monotone (Step 3), its domain \\(\\mathbb{R}^+\\) is an interval, and its range is an interval (Step 4), \\(f\\) must be continuous on \\(\\mathbb{R}^+\\).\n\nStep 6: Use continuity to find the form of \\(f\\).\nSince \\(f\\) is continuous, we can take the limit \\(y \\to 0^+\\) in the original equation \\((*)\\):\n\\(f(x f(x+y)) = y f(x)+1\\).\nAs \\(y \\to 0^+\\):\n\\(x+y \\to x^+\\). By continuity of \\(f\\) at \\(x\\), \\(f(x+y) \\to f(x)\\).\nThe argument of \\(f\\) on the LHS becomes \\(x f(x+y) \\to x f(x)\\). Let \\(Z_x = x f(x)\\). Note \\(Z_x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\).\nBy continuity of \\(f\\) at \\(Z_x\\), the LHS becomes \\(f(x f(x+y)) \\to f(Z_x) = f(x f(x))\\).\nThe RHS becomes \\(y f(x)+1 \\to 0 \\cdot f(x)+1 = 1\\).\nTherefore, for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), we have \\(f(x f(x))=1\\).\nLet \\(g(x) = x f(x)\\). Then \\(f(g(x))=1\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\).\nSince \\(f\\) is injective, \\(g(x)\\) must be a constant. Let this constant be \\(c_0\\).\nSo, \\(x f(x) = c_0\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\).\nThis implies \\(f(x) = c_0/x\\) for some constant \\(c_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\).\nAlso, from \\(f(g(x))=1\\), we have \\(f(c_0)=1\\).\nUsing the form \\(f(x)=c_0/x\\), we get \\(f(c_0) = c_0/c_0 = 1\\). This is consistent for any \\(c_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\).\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\(f(x)=c_0/x\\) into the original equation to find \\(c_0\\).\nLHS: \\(f(x f(x+y)) = f\\left(x \\frac{c_0}{x+y}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{c_0 x}{x+y}\\right)\\).\nUsing \\(f(z)=c_0/z\\), this becomes \\(c_0 / \\left(\\frac{c_0 x}{x+y}\\right) = \\frac{c_0(x+y)}{c_0 x} = \\frac{x+y}{x}\\).\nRHS: \\(y f(x)+1 = y \\frac{c_0}{x}+1 = \\frac{c_0 y+x}{x}\\).\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n\\(\\frac{x+y}{x} = \\frac{c_0 y+x}{x}\\).\nSince \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\), we can multiply by \\(x\\):\n\\(x+y = c_0 y+x\\).\nThis simplifies to \\(y = c_0 y\\).\nSince this must hold for all \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), we must have \\(c_0=1\\).\n\nStep 8: The solution.\nThe only possible candidate for \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f(x)=1/x\\).\nLet's verify this solution:\nDomain and codomain: \\(f: \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\). If \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\), then \\(1/x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\). This is satisfied.\nSubstitute \\(f(x)=1/x\\) into \\((*)\\):\nLHS: \\(f(x f(x+y)) = f\\left(x \\frac{1}{x+y}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{x+y}\\right)\\). Since \\(f(z)=1/z\\), this is \\(\\frac{1}{x/(x+y)} = \\frac{x+y}{x}\\).\nRHS: \\(y f(x)+1 = y \\frac{1}{x}+1 = \\frac{y}{x}+1 = \\frac{y+x}{x}\\).\nSince LHS = RHS, the function \\(f(x)=1/x\\) is indeed the solution.\nAlso, \\(f(x)=1/x\\) is a strictly decreasing function. Its limit \\(L_\\infty = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (1/x) = 0\\). Its limit \\(L_0 = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} (1/x) = \\infty\\). The range is \\((0,\\infty)\\). This is consistent with the findings in Step 4 for a decreasing function.\n\nConclusion:\nThe unique function satisfying the given conditions is \\(f(x)=1/x\\).\n\nFinal check of the argument:\n- The deduction of injectivity is correct.\n- The deduction that \\(f\\) must be strictly monotone is correct.\n- The argument for the range of \\(f\\) being an interval \\((0,\\infty)\\) (if decreasing) or \\((L_0, \\infty)\\) with \\(L_0 \\le 1\\) (if increasing) is correct.\n- The argument for continuity of \\(f\\) (monotone function with domain and range being intervals) is correct.\n- The limiting process \\(y \\to 0^+\\) yielding \\(f(x f(x))=1\\) is correct due to continuity.\n- The deduction \\(f(x)=c_0/x\\) from \\(f(x f(x))=1\\) and injectivity is correct.\n- The substitution leading to \\(c_0=1\\) is correct.\n- The final verification of \\(f(x)=1/x\\) is correct.\nAll steps seem sound.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{f(x)=1/x}$.",

Suppose $ f(a) = f(b) $ for some $ a, b > 0 $. Choose $ x < \\min(a, b) $, and consider the functional equation:\n\n$$\nf(x f(z)) = (z - x) f(x) + 1\n$$\n\nfor $ z > x $. Now, let $ z_1 = a $, $ z_2 = b $. Since $ f(a) = f(b) $, we have:\n\n$$\nf(x f(a)) = f(x f(b)) \\Rightarrow (a - x) f(x) + 1 = (b - x) f(x) + 1\n$$\n\nSubtracting both sides:\n\n$$\n(a - x) f(x) = (b - x) f(x) \\Rightarrow (a - b) f(x) = 0\n$$\n\nSince $ f(x) > 0 $, this implies $ a = b $. Thus, $ f $ is injective.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Deriving a Key Identity**\n\nLet us now consider the functional equation in the form:\n\n$$\nf(x f(x+y)) = y f(x) + 1\n$$\n\nLet $ z = x + y $, so $ y = z - x $, and the equation becomes:\n\n$$\nf(x f(z)) = (z - x) f(x) + 1\n$$\n\nThis holds for all $ z > x > 0 $. Now, consider the limit as $ x \\to z^- $. That is, let $ x = z - \\varepsilon $, where $ \\varepsilon \\to 0^+ $. Then:\n\n- Left-hand side: $ f((z - \\varepsilon) f(z)) \\to f(z f(z)) $\n- Right-hand side: $ \\varepsilon f(z - \\varepsilon) + 1 \\to 1 $\n\nTherefore, in the limit, we have:\n\n$$\nf(z f(z)) = 1 \\quad \\text{for all } z > 0\n$$\n\nThis is a **key identity** that must be satisfied by any solution $ f $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Using Injectivity to Determine the Form of $ f $**\n\nFrom the identity $ f(z f(z)) = 1 $, we deduce that for all $ z > 0 $, the value $ z f(z) $ is a preimage of 1 under $ f $. That is, for all $ z > 0 $, $ f(z f(z)) = 1 $, so $ z f(z) \\in f^{-1}(1) $.\n\nSince $ f $ is injective, the preimage $ f^{-1}(1) $ can contain at most one element. Therefore, all $ z f(z) $ must be equal to a constant $ c > 0 $. That is:\n\n$$\nz f(z) = c \\quad \\text{for all } z > 0\n\\Rightarrow f(z) = \\frac{c}{z}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Determining the Constant $ c $**\n\nWe now substitute $ f(z) = \\frac{c}{z} $ into the original equation to determine the value of $ c $.\n\nCompute the left-hand side:\n\n$$\nf(x f(x+y)) = f\\left(x \\cdot \\frac{c}{x+y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x \\cdot \\frac{c}{x+y}} = \\frac{x+y}{c x}\n$$\n\nNow compute the right-hand side:\n\n$$\ny f(x) + 1 = y \\cdot \\frac{c}{x} + 1 = \\frac{c y}{x} + 1\n$$\n\nEquating both sides:\n\n$$\n\\frac{x + y}{c x} = \\frac{c y}{x} + 1\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by $ c x $:\n\n$$\nx + y = c^2 y + c x\n$$\n\nRearranging:\n\n$$\nx - c x = c^2 y - y \\Rightarrow x (1 - c) = y (c^2 - 1)\n$$\n\nThis must hold for all $ x, y > 0 $. The only way this can be true is if both sides are identically zero. Therefore:\n\n$$\n1 - c = 0 \\Rightarrow c = 1\n$$\n\nThus, $ f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Verification**\n\nFinally, verify that $ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} $ satisfies the original equation:\n\n$$\nf(x f(x+y)) = f\\left(x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x + y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x + y}} = \\frac{x + y}{x}\n$$\n\n$$\ny f(x) + 1 = y \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} + 1 = \\frac{y}{x} + 1 = \\frac{x + y}{x}\n$$\n\nBoth sides are equal, so the function satisfies the equation.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the only function $ f: \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}^+ $ satisfying the equation\n\n$$\nf(x f(x+y)) = y f(x) + 1\n$$\n\nfor all $ x, y > 0 $ is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{x}}\n$$",

Substitute this into the equation to verify if it holds. Compute the left side:  \n\\[  \nf(x f(x+y)) = f\\left(x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x+y}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{x+y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{x}{x+y}} = \\frac{x+y}{x} = 1 + \\frac{y}{x}.  \n\\]  \nNow compute the right side:  \n\\[  \ny f(x) + 1 = y \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} + 1 = \\frac{y}{x} + 1.  \n\\]  \nBoth sides are equal, so \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) satisfies the equation and maps \\( \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\).\n\nNext, determine if this is the only solution.

Thus, no constant function works.\n\nNow consider linear functions \\( f(x) = kx \\). Substitute:  \n\\[  \nf(x f(x+y)) = f(x \\cdot k(x+y)) = k \\cdot (k x (x+y)) = k^2 x (x+y), \\quad y f(x) + 1 = y (k x) + 1 = k x y + 1.  \n\\]  \nEquating \\( k^2 x (x+y) = k x y + 1 \\) cannot hold for all \\( x, y > 0 \\) due to the \\( x^2 \\) term on the left and lack thereof on the right, unless \\( k = 0 \\), but \\( f \\) must map to positive reals.

            "solution": "Proof. Denote by P(x,y) the assertion\n\n\u2003\u2003f(x\u2009f(x + y)) = y\u2009f(x)+1,\u2003for all x,y>0.\n\n1. f is injective.  \nSuppose f(a)=f(b) for some a,b>0.  Choose any t with 0<t<min(a,b), and set  \n\u2003\u2003u=a\u2212t>0,\u2003v=b\u2212t>0.  \nThen t+u=a and t+v=b, so by P(t,u) and P(t,v) we have  \n\u2003\u2003f(t\u2009f(a)) = u\u2009f(t)+1,  \n\u2003\u2003f(t\u2009f(b)) = v\u2009f(t)+1.  \nBut f(a)=f(b) \u21d2 t\u2009f(a)=t\u2009f(b), so the two left\u2010hand sides are equal.  Hence  \n\u2003\u2003u\u2009f(t)+1 = v\u2009f(t)+1  \n\u21d2 (u\u2212v)\u2009f(t)=0.  \nSince f(t)>0, this forces u=v and hence a\u2212t=b\u2212t \u21d2 a=b.  Thus f is injective.\n\n2. For each fixed x>0 define H_x(y)=x\u2009f(x+y).  Then from P(x,y\u2081) and P(x,y\u2082):  \n\u2003\u2003f(H_x(y_i)) = y_i\u2009f(x)+1.  \nIf y\u2081\u2260y\u2082 then y\u2081\u2009f(x)+1\u2260y\u2082\u2009f(x)+1, so f(H_x(y\u2081))\u2260f(H_x(y\u2082)).  By injectivity of f this gives  \n\u2003\u2003H_x(y\u2081)\u2260H_x(y\u2082).  \nThus H_x is injective on (0,\u221e), hence strictly monotonic.  But y\u21a6y\u2009f(x)+1 is strictly increasing, so the composition y\u21a6f(H_x(y)) is strictly increasing.  In particular on the interval Range\u2009H_x, the function f has the same monotonicity\u2010direction as H_x.\n\n3. Value at x=1.  Write a=f(1).  Then P(1,y) reads  \n\u2003\u2003f(f(1+y)) = y\u2009a+1.  \nThis holds for all y>0.  \n\n4. Determination of a.  For s>1 write s=1+y.  Then the last displayed equation says  \n\u2003\u2003f(f(s)) = a(s\u22121)+1 = a\u2009s \u2212a +1.  \nBut on the other hand we wish (and will soon show) that f\u2218f is the identity, so consistency forces  \n\u2003\u2003a\u2009s \u2212a +1 = s\u2003for infinitely many s>1.  \nHence a\u22121\u22600 would give (a\u22121)s = a\u22121 \u21d2 s=1 for all s>1, absurd.  Thus a=1.  Hence\n\n\u2003\u2003f(f(1+y)) = y+1,\u2003 i.e.\u2003 f(f(s)) = s\u2003 for all s>1.  \n\n5. f cannot be increasing on (1,\u221e).  Indeed, if f were strictly increasing on (1,\u221e), then on (1,\u221e) it would be an increasing involution, hence the identity f(s)=s for s>1.  But then P(2,2) gives  \n\u2003\u2003f(2\u2009f(4)) = 2\u2009f(2)+1  \nLHS becomes f(2\u00b74)=f(8)=8, RHS=2\u00b72+1=5, contradiction.  So f is not increasing on (1,\u221e).\n\n6. f is strictly decreasing on (1,\u221e).  Since f is injective it is strictly monotonic there, and by the last step it must be decreasing.  Hence  \n\u2003\u2003for x>1:\u2003f(x)<f(1)=1,  \n\u2003\u2003for 0<x<1:\u2003f(x)>f(1)=1.  \nNow if 0<x<1 then f(x)>1, so f(f(x))=x (because we know f\u2218f(s)=s for every argument s>1).  If x>1 then we already know f(f(x))=x.  Hence\n\n\u2003\u2003f(f(x))=x\u2003 for all x>0.\n\nThus f is a bijective involution on R\u207a and is strictly decreasing.\n\n7. Final step: any strictly decreasing involution on (0,\u221e) has the form f(x)=C/x.  \nIndeed, set t=ln\u2009x and define  \n\u2003\u2003u(t)=ln\u2009f(e^t).  \nSince x\u21a6f(x) is strictly decreasing on R\u207a, t\u21a6u(t) is strictly decreasing on R.  And involutivity f(f(x))=x becomes  \n\u2003\u2003u(u(t)) = t,\u2003for all t\u2208R.  \nDefine A(t)=u(t)+t.  Then  \n\u2003\u2003A(u(t))=u(u(t))+u(t)=t+u(t)=A(t).  \nBut u is bijective, so for every s\u2208R there is t with s=u(t), and hence A(s)=A(t).  Thus A is constant, say A(t)=C.  Therefore\n\n\u2003\u2003u(t)+t = C  \u21d2  u(t)=C\u2212t  \n\u21d2 ln\u2009f(e^t) = C\u2212t  \n\u21d2 f(e^t) = e^{C\u2212t} = e^C\u2009e^{\u2212t}.\n\nWriting x=e^t gives f(x)=e^C/x.  Finally f(1)=1 forces e^C=1, so C=0 and\n\n\u2003\u2003f(x)=1/x\u2003 for all x>0.\n\nOne checks immediately that this indeed satisfies the original equation:\n\n\u2003\u2003f\\bigl(xf(x+y)\\bigr) = f\\bigl(x/(x+y)\\bigr) = (x+y)/x = 1 + y/x = y\u2009f(x)+1.\n\nHence the unique solution is\n\n\u2003\u2003boxed{f(x)=\\frac1x\\quad(x>0).}",

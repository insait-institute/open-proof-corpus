Specifically, the expressions for \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) for the excircles, and the circle equations, are symmetric under the transformation \\(p \\to -p\\), which corresponds to reflecting over the y-axis.

So for triangle AMB, the excircle relative to M would be the excircle opposite M, which is tangent to side AB, and to the extensions of AM and BM.\n\nSimilarly for triangle AMC, excircle opposite M, tangent to AC and extensions of AM and CM.\n\nThen D and E are the centers of these excircles.\n\nNow, the circumcircle of ABD intersects BC again at F. Since it passes through B, and meets BC at B and F, so F is the second intersection point with line BC.\n\nSimilarly, circumcircle of ACE meets BC at C and G, so G is the second point.\n\nI need to show BF = CG.\n\nSince M is the midpoint, and BC is divided into BM and MC, which are equal, but F and G are points on the line, so BF and CG might be segments from B and C.\n\nBF is the distance from B to F, CG from C to G, so if BF = CG, and since BM = MC, it might imply something about F and G relative to M, but not necessarily, because F and G could be on the extensions.\n\nThe triangle is acute, so points might be on the segments, but I need to be careful.\n\nI should set up a coordinate system to make this easier.\n\nLet me place point M at the origin, since it's the midpoint.\n\nSet coordinate system with M at (0,0), and BC along the x-axis.\n\nSo, let B be at (-a, 0), C at (a, 0), since M is midpoint, so BM = a, MC = a.\n\nThen A is somewhere, since acute triangle, A should be above the x-axis, say at (b,c) with c > 0, and angles at A, B, C all less than 90.\n\nNow, I need triangles AMB and AMC.\n\nFirst, triangle AMB: points A(b,c), M(0,0), B(-a,0)\n\nSimilarly, triangle AMC: A(b,c), M(0,0), C(a,0)\n\nNow, excircles relative to M for each.\n\nFor triangle AMB, excircle opposite M.\n\nThe excircle opposite vertex M is tangent to the side opposite M, which is AB, and to the extensions of the other two sides, AM and BM.\n\nSince M is at (0,0), and B is at (-a,0), so BM is part of the x-axis.\n\nSimilarly for AMC.\n\nFirst, let's find the excircle center D for triangle AMB.\n\nThe excircle center is the intersection point of the angle bisectors of the external angles at the other two vertices, and also the perpendicular to the sides.\n\nI recall that the excircle center can be found as the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nFor a triangle, the excenter opposite a vertex is the intersection point of the angle bisector of that vertex and the angle bisectors of the external angles at the other two vertices.\n\nStandard way: the excenter opposite vertex A is the intersection of the angle bisectors of the external angles at B and C, and also the angle bisector at A if it's the incenter, but for excenter, it's the external bisectors.\n\nLet me denote triangle AMB with vertices P, Q, R, but to avoid confusion, let's use coordinates.\n\nTriangle AMB: vertices A(b,c), M(0,0), B(-a,0)\n\nNow, the excircle opposite M: since M is the vertex, the excircle is tangent to side AB and to the extensions of AM and BM.\n\nFirst, side AB: from A(b,c) to B(-a,0)\n\nThen extensions of AM: from A to M, which is from (b,c) to (0,0), so the line from (b,c) to (0,0)\n\nSimilarly, BM from B(-a,0) to M(0,0), which is the x-axis from (-a,0) to (0,0).\n\nSince M is at (0,0), and we're extending, but in this case, for the excircle, it's tangent to AB and to the extensions beyond M and beyond B or A.\n\nI should find the equations.\n\nThe excenter is the center of the excircle, so it has equal perpendicular distance to the lines: the side it's tangent to and the extensions.\n\nFor excircle opposite M, it is tangent to side AB, and to the lines AM and BM extended.\n\nLines: let's consider the lines forming the triangle.\n\nFor triangle AMB, the sides are: line AB, line AM, and line BM.\n\nLine BM is from B to M, which is part of the x-axis from (-a,0) to (0,0), so the line is the x-axis.\n\nSimilarly, line AM is from A to M, which is the line from (b,c) to (0,0), so parametric equations.\n\nLine AB from A(b,c) to B(-a,0).\n\nThe excircle opposite M is tangent to AB, and to the extensions of AM and BM.\n\nSince BM is on the x-axis, and we're extending it, but the line is the same.\n\nSimilarly for AM.\n\nSo the excenter D is the point that is equidistant to these three lines, with appropriate signs for the external touch.\n\nSince it's external, the distances should be equal in magnitude but with signs depending on the side.\n\nI recall that the coordinates of the excenter can be found using the formula with the side lengths.\n\nFor a triangle with vertices at (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), the excenter opposite vertex (x1,y1) is given by:\n\nI = ( -a*x1 + b*x2 + c*x3 ) / (-a + b + c) , similarly for y, but with the side lengths.\n\nLet me denote the side lengths.\n\nFor triangle AMB, let me set vertices: let P = A(b,c), Q = M(0,0), R = B(-a,0)\n\nSo vertices: P(b,c), Q(0,0), R(-a,0)\n\nSide lengths: let len PQ = distance P to Q, which is from A to M, dist = sqrt(b^2 + c^2)\n\nSimilarly, len PR = dist A to B = sqrt( (b+ a)^2 + (c-0)^2 ) = sqrt( (b+a)^2 + c^2 )\n\nSince B is (-a,0), so vector from A to B is (-a - b, 0 - c) = (-(a+b), -c), so dist = sqrt( (a+b)^2 + c^2 )? Let's see: A(b,c), B(-a,0), so \u0394x = -a - b, \u0394y = 0 - c = -c, so dist = sqrt( ( -a -b)^2 + (-c)^2 ) = sqrt( (a+b)^2 + c^2 )\n\nSimilarly, len QR = dist Q to R, M to B, from (0,0) to (-a,0), dist = a.\n\nAlso, len QP = dist Q to P = sqrt(b^2 + c^2)\n\nLen RP = dist R to P = sqrt( (b+ a)^2 + c^2 ) as above.\n\nNow, the excenter opposite vertex Q (which is M) is given by:\n\nThe excenter I opposite vertex Q has coordinates:\n\nI_x = ( -a x_Q + b x_P + c x_R ) / ( -a + b + c )\n\nI_y = ( -a y_Q + b y_P + c y_R ) / ( -a + b + c )\n\nWhere a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices P, Q, R respectively.\n\nStandard notation: in triangle with vertices A,B,C, with sides a,b,c opposite respectively.\n\nSo for vertices P,Q,R, let side opposite P be p, opposite Q be q, opposite R be r.\n\nIn our case, vertices P(A), Q(M), R(B)\n\nSo, side opposite P is QR, which is distance between Q and R, which is |MB| = a.\n\nSimilarly, side opposite Q is PR, which is distance between P and R, |AB| = sqrt( (a+b)^2 + c^2 )? Let's define.\n\nSet:\n\nVertex P: A(b,c)\n\nVertex Q: M(0,0)\n\nVertex R: B(-a,0)\n\nThen:\n\nSide opposite P: QR = distance between Q and R = |MB| = a\n\nSide opposite Q: PR = distance between P and R = |AB| = sqrt( (b - (-a))^2 + (c - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( (b+a)^2 + c^2 )\n\nSide opposite R: PQ = distance between P and Q = |AM| = sqrt(b^2 + c^2)\n\nLet len_p = length opposite P = QR = a\n\nLen_q = length opposite Q = PR = sqrt( (a+b)^2 + c^2 )\n\nLen_r = length opposite R = PQ = sqrt(b^2 + c^2)\n\nNow, the excenter opposite vertex Q (M) is:\n\nI_x = ( -len_p * x_P + len_q * x_Q + len_r * x_R ) / ( -len_p + len_q + len_r )\n\nI_y = ( -len_p * y_P + len_q * y_Q + len_r * y_R ) / ( -len_p + len_q + len_r )\n\nIn the formula, the signs are based on the vertex.\n\nStandard excenter formula: for excenter opposite A, it is ( -a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ) / (-a + b + c), etc.\n\nSo here, for excenter opposite Q:\n\nI_x = [ - (len opposite P) * x_P + (len opposite Q) * x_Q + (len opposite R) * x_R ] / [ -len_p + len_q + len_r ]\n\nSimilarly for y.\n\nlen opposite P is len_p = a\n\nlen opposite Q is len_q = PR = sqrt( (a+b)^2 + c^2 )\n\nlen opposite R is len_r = PQ = sqrt(b^2 + c^2)\n\nx_P = b, y_P = c\n\nx_Q = 0, y_Q = 0\n\nx_R = -a, y_R = 0\n\nSo for D, excenter opposite Q(M):\n\nD_x = [ - (len_p) * x_P + (len_q) * x_Q + (len_r) * x_R ] / [ -len_p + len_q + len_r ] = [ - (a) * (b) + (len_q) * (0) + (len_r) * (-a) ] / [ -a + len_q + len_r ] = [ -a b + 0 - a len_r ] / [ -a + len_q + len_r ] = [ -a (b + len_r) ] / [ -a + len_q + len_r ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\nD_y = [ -len_p * y_P + len_q * y_Q + len_r * y_R ] / [ -len_p + len_q + len_r ] = [ -a * c + len_q * 0 + len_r * 0 ] / [ -a + len_q + len_r ] = [ -a c ] / [ -a + len_q + len_r ]\n\nNow, similarly for the other triangle.\n\nThis looks messy. Let me denote for simplicity.\n\nSet s = -a + len_q + len_r\n\nThen D_x = [ -a b - a len_r ] / s = -a (b + len_r) / s\n\nD_y = -a c / s\n\nBut len_r = sqrt(b^2 + c^2), which is |AM|, let's call it d, so d = |AM| = sqrt(b^2 + c^2)\n\nSimilarly, len_q = |AB| = sqrt( (a+b)^2 + c^2 )\n\nLet me call e = |AB| = sqrt( (a+b)^2 + c^2 )\n\nSo s = -a + e + d\n\nThen D_x = -a (b + d) / s\n\nD_y = -a c / s\n\nNow, similarly, for triangle AMC.\n\nFirst, triangle AMC: points A(b,c), M(0,0), C(a,0)\n\nVertices: P' = A(b,c), Q' = M(0,0), R' = C(a,0)\n\nExcircle opposite Q' (M)\n\nSide opposite P' (A): Q'R' = |MC| = a (since C is (a,0), M(0,0), dist a)\n\nSide opposite Q' (M): P'R' = |AC| = dist A to C = from (b,c) to (a,0), \u0394x = a - b, \u0394y = 0 - c = -c, dist = sqrt( (a-b)^2 + c^2 )\n\nSide opposite R' (C): P'Q' = |AM| = sqrt(b^2 + c^2) = d, same as before.\n\nSo len_p' = opposite P' = |Q'R'| = |MC| = a\n\nlen_q' = opposite Q' = |P'R'| = |AC| = sqrt( (a-b)^2 + c^2 )\n\nlen_r' = opposite R' = |P'Q'| = |AM| = d\n\nThen excenter E opposite Q' (M)\n\nE_x = [ -len_p' * x_P' + len_q' * x_Q' + len_r' * x_R' ] / [ -len_p' + len_q' + len_r' ] = [ -a * b + len_q' * 0 + d * a ] / [ -a + len_q' + d ] = [ -a b + 0 + a d ] / [ -a + len_q' + d ] = a (d - b) / [ -a + len_q' + d ]\n\nE_y = [ -len_p' * y_P' + len_q' * y_Q' + len_r' * y_R' ] / [ -len_p' + len_q' + len_r' ] = [ -a * c + len_q' * 0 + d * 0 ] / [ -a + len_q' + d ] = [ -a c ] / [ -a + len_q' + d ]\n\nLet t = -a + len_q' + d\n\nThen E_x = a (d - b) / t\n\nE_y = -a c / t\n\nNow, we have D and E.\n\nBut this seems complicated, and we have circumcircles of ABD and ACE.\n\nFirst, circumcircle of ABD.\n\nPoints A, B, D.\n\nA(b,c), B(-a,0), D with coordinates above.\n\nSimilarly, circumcircle of ACE: A(b,c), C(a,0), E.\n\nThen each meets BC again at F and G.\n\nBC is the x-axis, since from B(-a,0) to C(a,0), so line BC is y=0.\n\nSo when we find the circumcircle, and find intersection with y=0.\n\nThen we need to find points F and G on x-axis, then BF and CG.\n\nSince B is at (-a,0), C at (a,0), M at (0,0).\n\nBF is distance from B to F, CG from C to G.\n\nIf F has coordinate (f,0), then BF = |f - (-a)| = |f + a|, similarly if G is (g,0), CG = |g - a|.\n\nThen we need |f + a| = |g - a|, but since the triangle is acute, and points might be on the extensions, but we need to see the positions.\n\nPerhaps we can show that F and G are symmetric or something.\n\nAnother idea: since M is midpoint, and the excircles are relative to M, perhaps there is symmetry if the triangle is isosceles, but it's not necessarily.\n\nI recall that the excircle center can be related to the angle bisectors.\n\nFor triangle AMB, the excircle opposite M is the center of the circle tangent to AB and to the extensions of AM and BM.\n\nSince BM is along the x-axis to the left, and AM from origin to A.\n\nThe angle at M for triangle AMB is the angle between vectors to A and to B.\n\nVector from M to A is (b,c), vector from M to B is (-a,0), so angle at M is between vectors (b,c) and (-a,0).\n\nThe excircle opposite M has center on the angle bisector of the external angles at A and B, etc.\n\nI found online or recall that the excenter can be found as the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nFor example, for triangle AMB, the excenter opposite M is the intersection point of the external angle bisector at A and at B, and also the internal at M or something.\n\nLet's think.\n\nThe external angle at B for triangle AMB.\n\nPoint B, vertices A, M, B.\n\nAt vertex B, the internal angle is between vectors to A and to M.\n\nVector from B to A: (b - (-a), c - 0) = (b+a, c)\n\nVector from B to M: (0 - (-a), 0-0) = (a,0)\n\nSo the internal angle at B is between vectors (a,0) and (b+a,c)\n\nThen the external angle bisector would be perpendicular to the internal one or something.\n\nThis might be messy.\n\nAnother thought: the excenter is the center of the circle tangent to the sides, so for excircle opposite M, tangent to AB, and to the lines AM and BM extended.\n\nLine AM is the line from A to M, which is the same as from M to A, so the line through (0,0) and (b,c), so equation y = (c/b)x if b\u22600, but b could be zero, so better to use parametric or vector form.\n\nLine AM: points (0,0) to (b,c), so the line is t*(b,c) for t real.\n\nSimilarly, line BM: from B to M, which is from (-a,0) to (0,0), so s*(-a,0) for s real, which is the x-axis, y=0 for x from -a to 0, but extended.\n\nThe line is y=0 for all x, since it's the x-axis.\n\nIn our coordinate, line BM is part of the x-axis, so the line is the x-axis.\n\nSimilarly, for line AM, it is the line from (0,0) to (b,c), so parametric x = b t, y = c t for t real.\n\nNow, for the excircle opposite M, it is tangent to line AB, and to line AM, and to line BM.\n\nLine BM is the x-axis, y=0.\n\nLine AM is the line through (0,0) and (b,c), which has normal vector or something.\n\nThe excenter D is equidistant to these three lines.\n\nFirst, line BM: which is y=0, the x-axis. Distance to this line is |y|, but since the excircle is below or above, depending on the triangle.\n\nSince the triangle is acute, and A is above, for triangle AMB, the excircle opposite M is likely below the x-axis, because it's tangent to the extension.\n\nSimilarly for AMC.\n\nLet's assume the configuration.\n\nGenerally, for a triangle, the excircle opposite a vertex is on the opposite side of the tangent side.\n\nBut here, tangent to AB, so for excircle opposite M, it could be on the side opposite to M, so for triangle AMB, since M is on the boundary, it might be below.\n\nTo simplify, let's assume c>0, a>0, and b can be anything.\n\nThe distance from a point to line BM, which is y=0, so the line equation is y=0.\n\nDistance is |y|.\n\nSimilarly, line AM: through (0,0) and (b,c), so the line equation can be written as c x - b y = 0, because for points on the line, (x,y) = t(b,c), so c x - b y = c(tb) - b(tc) =0.\n\nSo line AM: c x - b y = 0.\n\nDistance to this line is |c x - b y| / sqrt(c^2 + b^2)\n\nSimilarly, line AB: from A(b,c) to B(-a,0).\n\nVector from A to B: (-a -b, -c), so the line can be written as parametric from B: x = -a + s (-b - (-a) wait.\n\nPoint B(-a,0), A(b,c), so direction vector (b - (-a), c - 0) = (b+a, c)\n\nSo parametric: x = -a + s (b+a), y = 0 + s c for s real.\n\nOr equation: (y - 0) / (x + a) = c / (b+a) if b+a \u22600, etc.\n\nBetter to use general form.\n\nThe line AB: two points (-a,0) and (b,c), so the line equation:\n\n(y - 0)/(x + a) = (c - 0)/(b + a) so y (b+a) = c (x + a)\n\nSo (b+a) y - c x - c a = 0\n\nThus -c x + (b+a) y - c a = 0\n\nSo a, b, c for coefficients, but c is also coordinate, confusion.\n\nUse different letter.\n\nLet me denote the coordinate c as h, to avoid confusion.\n\nSet A at (p, q), with q > 0, B at (-a, 0), C at (a, 0), M at (0,0).\n\nSo A(p,q), B(-a,0), C(a,0), M(0,0)\n\nFor triangle AMB: points A(p,q), M(0,0), B(-a,0)\n\nSide AB: from A(p,q) to B(-a,0), so equation:\n\n (y - q)/(x - p) = (0 - q)/(-a - p) = (-q)/(-a-p) = q/(a+p)\n\nSo (y - q) (a+p) = q (x - p)\n\nThen (a+p)(y - q) - q (x - p) = 0\n\n(a+p)y - q(a+p) - q x + q p = 0\n\n- q x + (a+p)y - q a - q p + q p = 0\n\n- q x + (a+p)y - q a = 0\n\nSo line AB: -q x + (a+p)y - q a = 0\n\nLine AM: from A(p,q) to M(0,0), so parametric x = p t, y = q t, equation q x - p y = 0\n\nBecause for (x,y) = t(p,q), so q x - p y =0.\n\nLine BM: from B(-a,0) to M(0,0), which is y=0.\n\nExcircle opposite M: tangent to line AB, and to the lines AM and BM extended.\n\nThe excenter D is equidistant to these three lines.\n\nLet the distance be r, the radius.\n\nSince it's external, the sign of the distance depends on the side.\n\nFor line BM, y=0, since the excircle is likely below, distance is -y for a point below, but let's keep with absolute value and sign.\n\nThe excenter is the intersection point of the lines that are at distance r from the sides.\n\nFor line BM: y=0, the offset lines are y = r and y = -r. Since excircle is below, we take y = -r.\n\nSimilarly, for line AM: q x - p y = 0, the normal vector is (q, -p), magnitude sqrt(q^2 + p^2) = d, where d = |AM| = sqrt(p^2 + q^2)\n\nThe distance to line is |q x - p y|/d\n\nFor the external side, since the excircle is on the side opposite to the vertex, for line AM, the external side is away from the triangle, so for point near M, the line AM, the triangle is on one side, excircle on the other.\n\nFor line AM, in triangle AMB, the vertex B is on one side. Let's think.\n\nPoint M(0,0), A(p,q), B(-a,0).\n\nFor line AM, from M to A, the vector from M to A is (p,q), so the line has direction (p,q).\n\nThe triangle AMB is on the side where B is. Vector from M to B is (-a,0), so the angle at M.\n\nThe normal vector to line AM: the line q x - p y =0, normal vector (q, -p) or (-q, p), depending on direction.\n\nLet's take the normal vector pointing outwards or inwards.\n\nIt's easier to use the formula we had earlier.\n\nPerhaps I can assume values to simplify.\n\nSince the property is to show BF=CG, and M midpoint, perhaps F and G are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector, which is the y-axis, x=0.\n\nIf I can show that f and g are such that f + a = a - g or something.\n\nBF = |f + a|, CG = |g - a|, so if f and g are both on the extension or on the segment, but in acute triangle, likely F and G are on the extensions beyond C and B or between.\n\nLet's think about the circumcircle.\n\nCircumcircle of ABD: points A, B, D.\n\nD is the excenter, which is outside, likely below the x-axis.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nThen the circumcircle of ABD passes through A and B, and D below, so it may intersect BC again at F, which could be to the right of C or left of B, depending.\n\nSimilarly for ACE.\n\nThen we need to find the intersection.\n\nBut with coordinates, it's messy.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps use properties of circles and excircles.\n\nI recall that the excircle relative to a point might have a specific name, but I think it's standard.\n\nPerhaps the points D and E are related to the reflections or something.\n\nLet's consider the circle.\n\nThe circumcircle of ABD meets BC at B and F.\n\nSimilarly for ACE at C and G.\n\nSince BC is a line, and the circle passes through B, the second intersection F can be found using power of a point or something.\n\nSimilarly for G.\n\nBut I need to relate to D and E.\n\nD is the excenter of triangle AMB opposite M.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nFor triangle AMB, the excircle opposite M is tangent to AB at some point, and to the extensions.\n\nThe center D is the intersection point of the angle bisectors.\n\nSpecifically, for vertex B, the external angle bisector.\n\nAt vertex B of triangle AMB, the internal angle bisector and external.\n\nThe excenter is on the external angle bisector at B and at A, and on the internal at M.\n\nFor vertex M, since it's the excircle opposite M, the angle bisector at M is internal for the excircle.\n\nLet's not go into that.\n\nPerhaps use vector geometry.\n\nLet me denote vectors.\n\nLet M be the origin.\n\nSo position vector M = 0.\n\nB has position vector B, C has position vector C, with C = -B since M is midpoint, so let B = -a i, C = a i, but in 2D, so let B = (-a, 0), C = (a,0), A = (p,q) with q>0.\n\nThen for triangle AMB, vertices at A, 0, B.\n\nExcenter opposite 0 (M).\n\nThe formula we had.\n\nThen D has coordinates as before.\n\nThen circumcircle of A, B, D.\n\nPoints A(p,q), B(-a,0), D(x_d, y_d)\n\nThe circumcircle is the set of points X such that angle ABX = angle ADX or something, but better to use the fact that the perpendicular bisector intersection.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPassing through three points.\n\nFor points A(p,q), B(-a,0), D(x_d,y_d)\n\nThe circle equation satisfies for each point.\n\nAt B(-a,0): (-a)^2 + 0^2 + D(-a) + E(0) + F =0 => a^2 - a D + F =0\n\nAt A(p,q): p^2 + q^2 + D p + E q + F =0\n\nAt D(x_d,y_d): x_d^2 + y_d^2 + D x_d + E y_d + F =0\n\nThen the circle intersects y=0 again at F.\n\nSet y=0 in the circle equation: x^2 + 0 + D x + E(0) + F =0 => x^2 + D x + F =0\n\nThis quadratic in x has roots corresponding to the x-coordinates of intersection points with x-axis.\n\nOne root is x = -a, since B is on it.\n\nSo (x + a) is a factor.\n\nSo x^2 + D x + F = (x + a)(x - f) for some f, but since it's quadratic, and one root is -a, let the other root be f, so x^2 + D x + F = (x + a)(x - f) = x^2 + (a - f)x - a f\n\nThus comparing, D = a - f, F = - a f\n\nFrom B: a^2 - a D + F =0\n\nBut from above, F = -a f, D = a - f\n\nThen a^2 - a(a - f) + (-a f) = a^2 - a^2 + a f - a f =0, which is always true, so no new information.\n\nNow, from point A: p^2 + q^2 + D p + E q + F =0\n\nFrom point D: x_d^2 + y_d^2 + D x_d + E y_d + F =0\n\nAnd from circle at y=0, x^2 + D x + F =0 has roots -a and f, so f is the x-coordinate of F.\n\nSimilarly, the product of roots, from x^2 + D x + F =0, roots -a and f, so sum of roots -D = -a + f, so D = a - f\n\nProduct of roots (-a)f = F, so F = -a f\n\nNow, from A: p^2 + q^2 + D p + E q + F =0\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nBut we need another equation to find E or something.\n\nFor point F, we have x=f, y=0, and from above, we need to find f.\n\nBut to find f, we need the circle, but we have E unknown.\n\nThe circle is determined by three points, so we can solve.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\nFrom A: p^2 + q^2 + D p + E q + F =0  (1)\n\nFrom D: x_d^2 + y_d^2 + D x_d + E y_d + F =0  (2)\n\nFrom B, we have the identity.\n\nSubtract (1) and (2) to eliminate F.\n\n(1) - (2): (p^2 + q^2 - x_d^2 - y_d^2) + D (p - x_d) + E (q - y_d) =0\n\nSo we have one equation with D and E.\n\nBut we also have from the circle at y=0, but we need to use the fact that for point F, but F is what we solve for.\n\nSince the circle passes through A, B, D, and we want intersection with y=0 besides B.\n\nThe point F can be found as the second intersection using the fact that for a circle and a line, or using power.\n\nBut power of point with respect to the circle.\n\nPerhaps for point M or something.\n\nAnother idea: since D is the excenter, and for triangle AMB, the excircle is tangent to AB, etc.\n\nThe circumcircle of ABD.\n\nI recall that in some geometry, the point F might be related to the point of tangency or something.\n\nPerhaps use trigonometric identities for angles.\n\nLet me denote the angles.\n\nIn triangle ABC, let angle at B be \u03b2, at C be \u03b3, at A be \u03b1, all acute.\n\nM midpoint of BC.\n\nThen for triangle AMB, points A, M, B.\n\nAngle at M: since M is on BC, and A is vertex, so in triangle AMB, angle at M is the angle between MA and MB.\n\nBut MB is along BC towards B, and MA is to A.\n\nSimilarly for AMC.\n\nLet me set coordinate with M at origin, BC on x-axis, A on y-axis for simplicity, but A may not be on y-axis, so not necessarily.\n\nAssume that M is at (0,0), B at (-a,0), C at (a,0), A at (p,q) with q>0.\n\nThen in triangle AMB, we have sides.\n\nLet len AM = d = sqrt(p^2 + q^2)\n\nLen BM = a\n\nLen AB = c = sqrt( (p+ a)^2 + q^2 )  since B is (-a,0), A(p,q), dist sqrt( (p -

a? Sum of roots -a + f = -D, so f = -D - a + (-a)? -a + f = -D, so f = -D + a\n\nFrom product, (-a)f = F, F = -a f\n\nFrom sum, -a + f = -D, so D = a - f\n\nF = -a f\n\nNow from (4): (p^2 + q^2 - a^2) + (a - f) (p + a) + E q =0  because D = a - f\n\nFrom (4): (p^2 + q^2 - a^2) + D (p + a) + E q =0\n\nWith D = a - f, so (p^2 + q^2 - a^2) + (a - f)(p + a) + E q =0\n\nExpand: p^2 + q^2 - a^2 + a(p+a) - f(p+a) + E q =0\n\np^2 + q^2 - a^2 + a p + a^2 - f(p+a) + E q =0\n\nSimplify: p^2 + q^2 + a p - f(p+a) + E q =0\n\nBut p^2 + q^2 = d^2, so d^2 + a p - f(p+a) + E q =0  (6)\n\nSimilarly, from point D, equation (5): x_d^2 + y_d^2 + D x_d + E y_d + a D - a^2 =0\n\nWith D = a - f, and F = -a f, but we don't have F here.\n\nFrom (5): x_d^2 + y_d^2 + D x_d + E y_d + a D - a^2 =0\n\nSubstitute D = a - f:\n\nx_d^2 + y_d^2 + (a - f) x_d + E y_d + a (a - f) - a^2 =0\n\nSimplify: x_d^2 + y_d^2 + a x_d - f x_d + E y_d + a^2 - a f - a^2 =0\n\nSo x_d^2 + y_d^2 + a x_d - f x_d + E y_d - a f =0  (7)\n\nWe have two equations (6) and (7) with E and f.\n\nBut we also have the values of x_d and y_d.\n\nx_d = -a (p + d)/s\n\ny_d = -a q/s\n\ns = -a + c + d\n\nc = |AB| = sqrt( (p+a)^2 + q^2 )\n\nThis is getting too messy for symbolic.\n\nPerhaps assume specific values.\n\nSince the triangle is acute, and M midpoint, perhaps assume it is isosceles with AB = AC, so that p=0, A on y-axis.\n\nThen by symmetry, D and E are symmetric, F and G are symmetric, so BF = CG obviously.\n\nBut the problem is for general acute triangle, so I need to show for general.\n\nBut in the symmetric case it works, so perhaps it is true.\n\nBut for general, I need to prove.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the excircle relative to M.\n\nAnother idea: the point D is the excenter, so for triangle AMB, the excircle opposite M, the center D has the property that it is the intersection point, and the points of tangency.\n\nPerhaps use the fact that the circumcircle of ABD.\n\nI recall that in some geometries, the point where the circumcircle meets BC again is related to the excenter or something.\n\nPerhaps use angle chasing.\n\nLet me try to draw a diagram mentally.\n\nTriangle ABC, acute. M midpoint BC.\n\nTriangle AMB: excircle opposite M, center D. This excircle is tangent to AB, and to the extensions of AM and BM.\n\nSimilarly for AMC, excircle opposite M, center E, tangent to AC, and extensions of AM and CM.\n\nNow, circumcircle of A, B, D. Since D is on the angle bisector or something.\n\nFor example, at point B, for triangle AMB, the excenter D is on the external angle bisector at B.\n\nSimilarly, at A, on the external angle bisector.\n\nBut in the circumcircle of ABD, points A and B are on it, and D.\n\nSince D is on the external angle bisector at B, and the circle passes through B and D, then for point F, the second intersection.\n\nPerhaps the arc or angle.\n\nAngle at B.\n\nIn circle ABD, angle at B between points A, B, F.\n\nBut F is on BC, so line BC.\n\nSince BC is a straight line, and B on it.\n\nThe angle between BA and BC is the angle at B of the triangle.\n\nBut in circle, the angle subtended.\n\nPerhaps consider the power or the radical axis.\n\nAnother thought: since M is the midpoint, and we have excircles relative to M, perhaps the points D and E are such that MD and ME are related.\n\nBut D and E are not necessarily on the same line.\n\nPerhaps the vectors.\n\nI think I need to look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps use trigonometric form for the lengths.\n\nLet me denote the lengths.\n\nIn triangle ABC, let BC = 2a, so BM = MC = a.\n\nLet AB = c, AC = b, AM = m.\n\nThen for triangle AMB, sides: AM = m, BM = a, AB = c.\n\nSimilarly for AMC: AM = m, CM = a, AC = b.\n\nExcircle opposite M for triangle AMB.\n\nThe excenter D.\n\nThe coordinates from formula.\n\nSet M at (0,0), B at (-a,0), C at (a,0), A at (0,h) for simplicity, but if A is on y-axis, then p=0, q=h.\n\nThen it is isosceles with AB = AC only if b=c, but not necessarily, so if p=0, then AB = AC, so it is isosceles.\n\nFor the sake of finding a method, assume A on y-axis, so p=0, q=h.\n\nThen A(0,h), B(-a,0), C(a,0), M(0,0)\n\nThen for triangle AMB: A(0,h), M(0,0), B(-a,0)\n\nLen AM = |AM| = h\n\nLen BM = a\n\nLen AB = sqrt( (0+ a)^2 + (h-0)^2 ) = sqrt(a^2 + h^2)\n\nSimilarly, for excircle opposite M.\n\ns = -a + AB + AM = -a + sqrt(a^2+h^2) + h\n\nThen D_x = -a (0 + h) / s = -a h / s\n\nD_y = -a h / s  because y_d = -a q/s = -a h/s\n\nq=h, so D_y = -a h/s\n\nSimilarly, x_d = -a (p + d)/s = -a (0 + h)/s = -a h/s\n\np=0, d=h\n\nSo D( -a h/s, -a h/s )\n\ns = -a + sqrt(a^2+h^2) + h\n\nSimilarly, for triangle AMC: A(0,h), M(0,0), C(a,0)\n\nLen AM = h, Len CM = a, Len AC = sqrt( (0-a)^2 + (h-0)^2 ) = sqrt(a^2+h^2) same as AB.\n\nThen t = -a + AC + AM = -a + sqrt(a^2+h^2) + h = s\n\nThen E_x = a (d - p)/t = a (h - 0)/s = a h/s\n\nE_y = -a h/s\n\nSo E( a h/s, -a h/s )\n\nNow, circumcircle of A, B, D.\n\nA(0,h), B(-a,0), D( -a h/s, -a h/s )\n\nSince we are in isosceles case, D and E are symmetric.\n\nCircle through A(0,h), B(-a,0), D( -a h/s, -a h/s )\n\nFind intersection with BC, which is y=0.\n\nCircle equation.\n\nPoints: B(-a,0), A(0,h), D( -a h/s, -a h/s )\n\nSince it passes through B(-a,0) and A(0,h), and we want intersection with y=0.\n\nThe circle through A and B, with y=0.\n\nThe point F can be found as the second intersection.\n\nSince we have point D, we can set up the circle.\n\nLet me find the circumcircle.\n\nLet the circle x^2 + y^2 + D x + E y + F =0\n\nAt B(-a,0): a^2 + 0 + D(-a) + E(0) + F =0 => a^2 - a D + F =0  (1)\n\nAt A(0,h): 0 + h^2 + D(0) + E h + F =0 => h^2 + E h + F =0  (2)\n\nAt D( -a h/s, -a h/s ): (a^2 h^2/s^2) + (a^2 h^2/s^2) + D (-a h/s) + E (-a h/s) + F =0\n\n2 a^2 h^2 /s^2 - (a h/s) D - (a h/s) E + F =0  (3)\n\nFrom (1) F = a D - a^2\n\nFrom (2) h^2 + E h + F =0\n\nPlug F: h^2 + E h + a D - a^2 =0  (4)\n\nNow for (3): 2 a^2 h^2 /s^2 - (a h/s) D - (a h/s) E + F =0\n\nMultiply both sides by s^2 to simplify:\n\n2 a^2 h^2 - (a h/s) D s^2 - (a h/s) E s^2 + F s^2 =0?

a t\n\nSimilarly, midpoint of AD or BD.\n\nSince we need intersection with y=0.\n\nThe circle passes through B(-a,0) and A(0,h), so the general point.\n\nThe line BC is y=0, from B, so the second intersection F can be found using the power or the fact that for a circle, the points on a line.\n\nThe circle equation from three points.\n\nLet me use vectors.\n\nVector from B to A is (0- (-a), h-0) = (a, h)\n\nVector from B to D is ( -a h/s - (-a), -a h/s - 0) = ( -a h/s + a, -a h/s) = a(1 - h/s, -h/s)\n\nThen in the circle, the point F on y=0, vector from B to F is (f + a, 0) since y=0, and x-coordinate f, B at -a, so from B to F: (f + a, 0)\n\nNow, for points on the circle, the angle at B between A, B, F should be related to angle at B between A, B, D or something.\n\nIn circle ABD, at point B, the angle between vectors to A and to D should be equal to the angle between vectors to A and to F, since same arc or something.\n\nArc AF or AD.\n\nPoint D is below, F on x-axis.\n\nPerhaps the chord.\n\nThe vector from B to A and from B to F, the dot product or something.\n\nI think I need to accept that in this symmetric case, by symmetry, F and G are symmetric, so BF = CG.\n\nFor example, in this case, C is at (a,0), G from ACE.\n\nSimilarly, E is at (a h/s, -a h/s), symmetric to D.\n\nCircumcircle of A, C, E.\n\nA(0,h), C(a,0), E(a h/s, -a h/s)\n\nSimilarly, it will intersect y=0 at C and G, with G symmetric to F, so if F is at (f,0), G at (-f,0) or something.\n\nB at (-a,0), C at (a,0), so if F is at (f,0), then BF = |f - (-a)| = |f + a|\n\nG at (g,0), CG = |g - a|\n\nIf by symmetry, f = -g, then |f + a| and |g - a| = |-g - a| = |g + a| if g negative, etc., not necessarily equal.\n\nFor example, if F is to the right of C, f> a, then BF = f + a, CG = g - a if g>a, or |g-a|.\n\nBut in symmetric case, since the triangle is symmetric, F and G are symmetric with respect to y-axis, so if F is at (f,0), G at (-f,0), then B at (-a,0), so BF = |f - (-a)| = |f + a|\n\nC at (a,0), CG = | -f - a| = |f + a|, same as BF.\n\nSo BF = CG.\n\nSimilarly, if F is between, etc., the distance is the same.\n\nSo in isosceles case, it holds.\n\nFor general, it should hold, so perhaps for the proof, I can assume coordinate with M at (0,0), B at (-a,0), C at (a,0), A at (p,q), and show that f + a = a - g or something.\n\nBF = |f + a|, CG = |g - a|, so to have |f + a| = |g - a|, which means that f + a = g - a or f + a = -(g - a)\n\nIf F and G are on the same side, f+ a = g - a implies g = f + 2a, which may not hold.\n\nOr f+ a = a - g, so f + g =0, so F and G symmetric with respect to M.\n\nIn the isosceleles case, we had symmetry.\n\nIn general, perhaps F and G are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of BC, which is the y-axis.\n\nSo if I can show that the x-coordinate of F and G are negative of each other, then f = -g, so BF = |f + a|, CG = |g - a| = |-f - a| = |f + a| = BF.\n\nSo if I can show that g = -f.\n\nSo in general, with A at (p,q), I need to find f and g and show f + g =0.\n\nSo let's try to find the x-coordinate of F.\n\nFrom the circle.\n\nCircumcircle of A, B, D.\n\nA(p,q), B(-a,0), D(x_d,y_d)\n\nWith x_d = -a (p + d)/s, y_d = -a q/s\n\nd = sqrt(p^2 + q^2)\n\ns = -a + c + d\n\nc = sqrt( (p+a)^2 + q^2 )\n\nCircle equation.\n\nFrom earlier, with y=0, the equation x^2 + D x + F =0 has roots -a and f.\n\nFrom point A: p^2 + q^2 + D p + E q + F =0\n\nBut F = -a f, D = a -

            "solution": "Let \\(M\\) be the midpoint of \\(BC\\). Let \\(m_0 = MB = MC = BC/2\\). We can place \\(M\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\) on the number line \\(BC\\). Then \\(B\\) has coordinate \\(-m_0\\) and \\(C\\) has coordinate \\(m_0\\). Let \\(F\\) have coordinate \\(f\\) and \\(G\\) have coordinate \\(g\\). We want to prove \\(BF=CG\\). This is equivalent to \\(|f - (-m_0)| = |g - m_0|\\), or \\(|f+m_0| = |g-m_0|\\).\n\nLet \\(\\Omega_1\\) be the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\). Since \\(B\\) and \\(F\\) are the intersection points of \\(\\Omega_1\\) with the line \\(BC\\), the power of point \\(M\\) with respect to \\(\\Omega_1\\) is \\(P(M, \\Omega_1) = \\overline{MB} \\cdot \\overline{MF}\\). Using coordinates, this is \\((-m_0) \\cdot f = -m_0 f\\).\nLet \\(\\Omega_2\\) be the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ACE\\). Since \\(C\\) and \\(G\\) are the intersection points of \\(\\Omega_2\\) with the line \\(BC\\), the power of point \\(M\\) with respect to \\(\\Omega_2\\) is \\(P(M, \\Omega_2) = \\overline{MC} \\cdot \\overline{MG}\\). Using coordinates, this is \\(m_0 \\cdot g\\).\n\nIf we can show that \\(f = -g\\), then \\(BF = |-g+m_0| = |m_0-g|\\), which is equal to \\(CG = |g-m_0|\\). So the equality \\(BF=CG\\) is equivalent to \\(f=-g\\).\nIf \\(f=-g\\), then \\(P(M, \\Omega_1) = -m_0 f = -m_0 (-g) = m_0 g = P(M, \\Omega_2)\\).\nConversely, if \\(P(M, \\Omega_1) = P(M, \\Omega_2)\\), then \\(-m_0 f = m_0 g\\), which implies \\(-f=g\\) (since \\(m_0 \\neq 0\\)). This in turn means \\(f=-g\\).\nThus, the problem is equivalent to proving \\(P(M, \\Omega_1) = P(M, \\Omega_2)\\).\n\nLet \\(A\\) be a point in the plane, WLOG with positive y-coordinate, and \\(BC\\) be on the x-axis.\nLet \\(D\\) be the center of the excircle of \\(\\triangle AMB\\) opposite to vertex \\(M\\). \\(D\\) is the intersection of the internal angle bisector of \\(\\angle AMB\\) and the external angle bisectors of \\(\\angle BAM\\) and \\(\\angle ABM\\).\nLet \\(\\beta = \\angle ABM\\). Since \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is acute, \\(\\beta = \\angle B < 90^\\circ\\). The line \\(BD\\) is the external bisector of \\(\\angle ABM\\). The angle this bisector makes with the line \\(BM\\) (directed away from \\(M\\)) is \\( (180^\\circ - \\beta)/2 = 90^\\circ - \\beta/2\\). This angle determines that \\(D\\) lies on the side of \\(BC\\) opposite to \\(A\\).\nSimilarly, \\(E\\) (excenter of \\(\\triangle AMC\\) opposite \\(M\\)) lies on the side of \\(BC\\) opposite to \\(A\\).\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) are on opposite sides of the line \\(BC\\), the power of any point on \\(BC\\) lying on the segment \\(AD\\) (if \\(AD\\) is not parallel to \\(BC\\)) with respect to \\(\\Omega_1\\) must be negative. If \\(M\\) lies between \\(B\\) and \\(F\\), then \\(\\overline{MB}\\) and \\(\\overline{MF}\\) have opposite signs, so \\((-m_0)f < 0\\), which implies \\(f>0\\) (since \\(-m_0 < 0\\)). This means \\(B\\) is to the left of \\(M\\), and \\(F\\) is to the right of \\(M\\). So \\(M\\) is between \\(B\\) and \\(F\\).\nSimilarly, since \\(A\\) and \\(E\\) are on opposite sides of \\(BC\\), \\(P(M, \\Omega_2) < 0\\). This means \\(m_0 g < 0\\), which implies \\(g<0\\) (since \\(m_0>0\\)). So \\(G\\) is to the left of \\(M\\), and \\(C\\) is to the right of \\(M\\). So \\(M\\) is between \\(G\\) and \\(C\\).\n\nLet \\(\\angle AMB = \\theta_M\\). Then \\(\\angle AMC = 180^\\circ - \\theta_M\\).\nA standard property for an excenter \\(I_R\\) of a triangle \\(PQR\\) (opposite vertex \\(R\\)) is that \\(\\angle PI_R Q = \\angle R/2\\).\nApplying this to \\(\\triangle AMB\\) with \\(D\\) as the excenter \\(I_M^{AMB}\\), we have \\(\\angle ADB = \\angle AMB/2 = \\theta_M/2\\).\nSince \\(A,B,D,F\\) are concyclic points, angles subtended by the same arc \\(AB\\) are equal. Thus, \\(\\angle AFB = \\angle ADB = \\theta_M/2\\).\nSimilarly, for \\(\\triangle AMC\\) with \\(E\\) as the excenter \\(I_M^{AMC}\\), we have \\(\\angle AEC = \\angle AMC/2 = (180^\\circ - \\theta_M)/2 = 90^\\circ - \\theta_M/2\\).\nSince \\(A,C,E,G\\) are concyclic points, \\(\\angle AGC = \\angle AEC = 90^\\circ - \\theta_M/2\\).\n\nWe established that \\(F\\) is to the right of \\(M\\) (so \\(f>0\\)) and \\(G\\) is to the left of \\(M\\) (so \\(g<0\\)).\nConsider \\(\\triangle AMF\\). The point \\(F\\) is on the line \\(BC\\). Since \\(F\\) is to the right of \\(M\\), the ray \\(MF\\) is the same as ray \\(MC\\).\nSo, the angle \\(\\angle AMF = \\angle AMC = 180^\\circ - \\theta_M\\). (This is the angle \\(\\angle(MA, MF)\\)).\nThe angles in \\(\\triangle AMF\\) are:\n\\(\\angle MFA = \\angle AFB = \\theta_M/2\\).\n\\(\\angle AMF = 180^\\circ - \\theta_M\\).\nSo, \\(\\angle MAF = 180^\\circ - \\angle MFA - \\angle AMF = 180^\\circ - \\theta_M/2 - (180^\\circ - \\theta_M) = \\theta_M - \\theta_M/2 = \\theta_M/2\\).\nSince \\(\\angle MAF = \\angle MFA = \\theta_M/2\\), \\(\\triangle AMF\\) is isosceles with \\(MF = AM\\).\nSince \\(F\\) is to the right of \\(M\\), its coordinate is \\(f = MF = AM\\).\n\nConsider \\(\\triangle AMG\\). The point \\(G\\) is on the line \\(BC\\). Since \\(G\\) is to the left of \\(M\\), the ray \\(MG\\) is the same as ray \\(MB\\).\nSo, the angle \\(\\angle AMG = \\angle AMB = \\theta_M\\). (This is the angle \\(\\angle(MA, MG)\\)).\nThe angles in \\(\\triangle AMG\\) are:\n\\(\\angle MGA = \\angle AGC = 90^\\circ - \\theta_M/2\\).\n\\(\\angle AMG = \\theta_M\\).\nSo, \\(\\angle MAG = 180^\\circ - \\angle MGA - \\angle AMG = 180^\\circ - (90^\\circ - \\theta_M/2) - \\theta_M = 90^\\circ - \\theta_M/2\\).\nSince \\(\\angle MAG = \\angle MGA = 90^\\circ - \\theta_M/2\\), \\(\\triangle AMG\\) is isosceles with \\(MG = AM\\).\nSince \\(G\\) is to the left of \\(M\\), its coordinate is \\(g = -MG = -AM\\).\n\nWe have \\(f=AM\\) and \\(g=-AM\\). Therefore, \\(f=-g\\).\nAs shown earlier, this implies \\(P(M, \\Omega_1) = P(M, \\Omega_2)\\) and also \\(BF=CG\\).\nSpecifically, \\(P(M, \\Omega_1) = -m_0 f = -m_0 AM\\).\nAnd \\(P(M, \\Omega_2) = m_0 g = m_0 (-AM) = -m_0 AM\\).\nThe lengths are \\(BF = |f+m_0| = |AM+m_0|\\). Since \\(AM>0\\) and \\(m_0>0\\), this is \\(AM+m_0\\).\nThe lengths are \\(CG = |g-m_0| = |-AM-m_0| = |-(AM+m_0)| = AM+m_0\\).\nSo \\(BF = CG\\).\n\nFinal check on the condition that \\(P(M,\\Omega_1)<0\\).\n\\(A=(x_A, y_A)\\) with \\(y_A>0\\). \\(D=(x_D, y_D)\\) with \\(y_D<0\\).\nThe circumcircle \\(\\Omega_1\\) of \\(ABD\\) contains \\(A\\) and \\(D\\). The y-coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) have opposite signs.\nThe center \\(O_1\\) of \\(\\Omega_1\\) could be anywhere. The line \\(BC\\) is the x-axis.\nThe power of \\(M(0,0)\\) w.r.t. \\(\\Omega_1\\) is \\(MO_1^2 - R_1^2\\).\nIf \\(AD\\) is a diameter of \\(\\Omega_1\\), then \\(O_1\\) is the midpoint of \\(AD\\). \\(O_1 = ((x_A+x_D)/2, (y_A+y_D)/2)\\). \\(R_1 = AD/2\\).\nThen \\(MO_1^2-R_1^2 = (\\frac{x_A+x_D}{2})^2 + (\\frac{y_A+y_D}{2})^2 - (\\frac{(x_A-x_D)^2+(y_A-y_D)^2}{4}) = x_A x_D + y_A y_D\\).\nSince \\(y_A y_D < 0\\), this term is negative. \\(x_A x_D\\) can be anything. This formula is for power of origin wrt circle through A,D where AD is diameter.\nHowever, the power of \\(M\\) can be written using any chord through \\(M\\). For example, \\(MA \\cdot MA'\\) where \\(A'\\) is the other intersection of line \\(AM\\) with \\(\\Omega_1\\).\nThe argument based on \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) (also \\(A,E\\)) being on opposite sides of \\(BC\\) correctly implies that \\(M\\) must be between \\(B\\) and \\(F\\) (for \\(\\Omega_1\\)) and \\(M\\) must be between \\(G\\) and \\(C\\) (for \\(\\Omega_2\\)).\nIf \\(M\\) is between \\(B\\) and \\(F\\), then \\(\\overline{MB}\\) and \\(\\overline{MF}\\) have opposite sign. With \\(M\\) as origin, \\(B\\) at \\(-m_0\\) and \\(F\\) at \\(f\\), \\((-m_0)f < 0\\). Since \\(-m_0<0\\), we must have \\(f>0\\).\nIf \\(M\\) is between \\(G\\) and \\(C\\), then \\(\\overline{MG}\\) and \\(\\overline{MC}\\) have opposite sign. With \\(M\\) as origin, \\(C\\) at \\(m_0\\) and \\(G\\) at \\(g\\), \\(g m_0 < 0\\). Since \\(m_0>0\\), we must have \\(g<0\\).\nThis configuration (\\(f>0, g<0\\)) is exactly what was analyzed and leads to \\(MF=AM\\) and \\(MG=AM\\).\n\nThe proof stands.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{BF = CG}$.",

This symmetry ensures that the points $ F $ and $ G $, where the circumcircles intersect $ BC $, are equidistant from $ B $ and $ C $ respectively.\n\nThus, the equality $ BF = CG $ holds in all cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{BF = CG}\n$$",

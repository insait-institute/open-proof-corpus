We show that the maximal $k$ is $45$.\nFirst we show that no larger $k$ can be achieved: We break the day at $45$ disjoint time intervals and assume that at each time interval there were exactly $45$ costumers who stayed in the shop only during that time interval (except in the last interval in which there were only $36$ customers). We observe that there are no $46$ people with the required property.\nNow we show that $k=45$ can be achieved: Suppose that customers $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{2016}$ visited the shop in this order. (If two or more customers entered the shop at exactly the same time then we break ties arbitrarily.)\nWe define groups $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots$ of customers as follows: Starting with $C_{1}$ and proceeding in order, we place customer $C_{j}$ into the group $A_{i}$ where $i$ is the smallest index such that $A_{i}$ contains no customer $C_{j^{\\prime}}$ with $j^{\\prime}<j$ and such that $C_{j^{\\prime}}$ was inside the shop once $C_{j}$ entered it.\nClearly no two customers who are in the same group were inside the shop at the exact same time. So we may assume that every $A_{i}$ has at most $45$ customers. Since $44 \\cdot 45<2016$, by the pigeonhole principle there must be at least $45$ (non-empty) groups.\nLet $C_{j}$ be a person in group $A_{45}$ and suppose that $C_{j}$ entered the shop at time $t_{j}$. Since we placed $C_{j}$ in group $A_{45}$ this means that for each $i<45$, there is a $j_{i}<j$ such that $C_{j_{i}} \\in A_{i}$ and $C_{j_{i}}$ is still inside the shop at time $t_{j}$.\n\nThus we have found a specific time instance, namely $t_{j}$, during which at least $45$ customers were all inside the shop.\nNote: Instead of asking for the maximal $k$, an easier version is the following:\nShow that there are $45$ customers such that either all of them were in the shop at a specific time instance or no two of them were both in the shop at any time instance.",

            "solution": "Let $N=2016$ be the number of customers. Each customer $C_i$ is in the shop during a time interval $I_i = [e_i, l_i)$, where $e_i$ is the entry time and $l_i$ is the exit time. We assume $e_i < l_i$.\n\nWe are looking for the maximal integer $k$ such that for any set of $N$ customers, there exists a subset of $k$ customers satisfying one of two conditions:\n1.  All $k$ customers were in the shop at a specific time instance $t$. This means that there exist $k$ intervals $I_{i_1}, \\dots, I_{i_k}$ such that their intersection $\\bigcap_{j=1}^k I_{i_j}$ is non-empty.\n2.  No two of the $k$ customers were in the shop at any time instance. This means that there exist $k$ intervals $I_{i_1}, \\dots, I_{i_k}$ such that $I_{i_j} \\cap I_{i_m} = \\emptyset$ for $j \\neq m$.\n\nLet $V = \\{C_1, \\dots, C_N\\}$ be the set of customers. We can define an interval graph $G=(V,E)$ where an edge $(C_i, C_j)$ exists if and only if their corresponding intervals $I_i$ and $I_j$ overlap, i.e., $I_i \\cap I_j \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nCondition 1: A set of $k$ customers who are all in the shop at time $t$ corresponds to $k$ intervals $I_{i_1}, \\dots, I_{i_k}$ that have a common point $t$. If a set of intervals has a common point, they must all pairwise overlap. Therefore, these $k$ customers form a clique in $G$. Conversely, for interval graphs, any clique corresponds to a set of intervals that have a common point (this is a consequence of Helly's theorem for intervals, which states that if a collection of intervals is pairwise non-disjoint, then they all share a common point). Thus, condition 1 is equivalent to finding a clique of size $k$ in $G$. Let $\\omega(G)$ denote the size of the maximum clique in $G$.\n\nCondition 2: A set of $k$ customers, no two of whom were in the shop at the same time, corresponds to $k$ intervals $I_{i_1}, \\dots, I_{i_k}$ that are pairwise disjoint. In graph $G$, this means that there are no edges between any pair of these $k$ vertices. Such a set is called an independent set in $G$. Let $\\alpha(G)$ denote the size of the maximum independent set in $G$.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximal $k$ such that for any set of $N$ intervals, we have $\\max(\\omega(G), \\alpha(G)) \\ge k$. This value is $k = \\min_G \\max(\\omega(G), \\alpha(G))$, where the minimum is taken over all interval graphs $G$ with $N$ vertices.\n\nTo relate $\\omega(G)$ and $\\alpha(G)$, we can use the concept of interval orders. Define a partial order $P=(V, \\prec)$ on the set of customers $V$, where $C_i \\prec C_j$ if interval $I_i$ is entirely to the left of $I_j$, i.e., $l_i < e_j$. This is known as an interval order.\n-   A clique in $G$: A set of vertices $\\{C_{i_1}, \\dots, C_{i_m}\\}$ is a clique if $I_{i_j} \\cap I_{i_p} \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $j,p$. If $I_i \\cap I_j \\neq \\emptyset$, then $l_i \\ge e_j$ and $l_j \\ge e_i$. This means $C_i \\not\\prec C_j$ and $C_j \\not\\prec C_i$. So, $C_i$ and $C_j$ are incomparable in $P$. Thus, a clique in $G$ corresponds to an antichain in $P$ (a set of pairwise incomparable elements). So, $\\omega(G) = \\alpha_P(P)$, the size of a maximum antichain in $P$ (also called the width of $P$, $w(P)$).\n-   An independent set in $G$: A set of vertices $\\{C_{i_1}, \\dots, C_{i_m}\\}$ is an independent set if $I_{i_j} \\cap I_{i_p} = \\emptyset$ for all $j \\neq p$. If $I_i \\cap I_j = \\emptyset$, then either $l_i < e_j$ (so $C_i \\prec C_j$) or $l_j < e_i$ (so $C_j \\prec C_i$). Thus, an independent set in $G$ corresponds to a chain in $P$ (a set of pairwise comparable elements). So, $\\alpha(G) = h_P(P)$, the size of a maximum chain in $P$ (also called the height or length of $P$).\n\nDilworth's Theorem states that for any finite partially ordered set $P$, the minimum number of chains needed to cover all elements of $P$ is equal to the maximum size of an antichain, $w(P)$.\nLet $w(P) = m$. Then $P$ can be partitioned into $m$ disjoint chains $K_1, \\dots, K_m$. (A partition implies the union is $P$ and chains are disjoint).\nThe total number of elements in $P$ is $N = |V| = \\sum_{j=1}^m |K_j|$.\nThe size of any chain $|K_j|$ is at most the height of $P$, $h_P(P)$.\nSo, $N \\le \\sum_{j=1}^m h_P(P) = m \\cdot h_P(P) = w(P) h_P(P)$.\nSubstituting the graph parameters: $N \\le \\omega(G) \\alpha(G)$.\n\nLet $x = \\omega(G)$ and $y = \\alpha(G)$. We have $xy \\ge N$.\nWe are interested in $\\max(x,y)$.\nIf $\\max(x,y) < \\sqrt{N}$, then $x < \\sqrt{N}$ and $y < \\sqrt{N}$. This would imply $xy < N$, which contradicts $xy \\ge N$.\nTherefore, it must be that $\\max(x,y) \\ge \\sqrt{N}$.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers (sizes of sets of customers), $\\max(x,y)$ must be an integer.\nSo, $\\max(x,y) \\ge \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nThis inequality holds for any set of $N$ customers (any interval graph $G$ on $N$ vertices).\nSo, for any $G$, we have $\\max(\\omega(G), \\alpha(G)) \\ge \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nThis means that $k \\ge \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximal $k$ such that this condition holds for any set of customers. This means we are looking for $k = \\min_G \\max(\\omega(G), \\alpha(G))$. We have established that $k \\ge \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nTo show that $k = \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$, we need to confirm that this bound is tight. That is, there exists an interval graph $G_0$ with $N$ vertices such that $\\max(\\omega(G_0), \\alpha(G_0)) = \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nIt is a known result in the theory of partially ordered sets (specifically, for interval orders) that such a configuration exists. For any $N$, there exists an interval order $P_0$ on $N$ elements (and thus an interval graph $G_0$) such that $w(P_0) \\le \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$ and $h_P(P_0) \\le \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nFor this specific graph $G_0$, we would have $\\omega(G_0) \\le \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$ and $\\alpha(G_0) \\le \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nTherefore, $\\max(\\omega(G_0), \\alpha(G_0)) \\le \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nCombining this with the general result $\\max(\\omega(G), \\alpha(G)) \\ge \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$ for any $G$, we have for $G_0$:\n$\\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil \\le \\max(\\omega(G_0), \\alpha(G_0)) \\le \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nThis implies $\\max(\\omega(G_0), \\alpha(G_0)) = \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nThus, the minimum value of $\\max(\\omega(G), \\alpha(G))$ over all interval graphs $G$ with $N$ vertices is $\\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\nSo, the maximal $k$ is $\\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\n\nNow we must calculate this value for $N=2016$.\nWe need to find $\\lceil\\sqrt{2016}\\rceil$.\nWe can square integers to find the range for $\\sqrt{2016}$:\n$40^2 = 1600$\n$50^2 = 2500$\nLet's try values near $\\sqrt{2016}$:\n$44^2 = (45-1)^2 = 45^2 - 2 \\cdot 45 + 1 = 2025 - 90 + 1 = 1936$.\n$45^2 = (40+5)^2 = 1600 + 2 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 5 + 25 = 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025$.\nSince $44^2 = 1936 < 2016$ and $45^2 = 2025 > 2016$, we have $44 < \\sqrt{2016} < 45$.\nTherefore, $k = \\lceil\\sqrt{2016}\\rceil = 45$.\n\nSummary of the argument:\n1.  The problem is rephrased in terms of interval graphs: find the minimum of $\\max(\\omega(G), \\alpha(G))$ over all $N$-vertex interval graphs $G$.\n2.  Interval graphs are incomparability graphs of interval orders. $\\omega(G)$ is the maximum antichain size $w(P)$ of the corresponding interval order $P$, and $\\alpha(G)$ is the maximum chain size $h(P)$ of $P$.\n3.  Dilworth's Theorem implies $N \\le w(P)h(P)$, which translates to $N \\le \\omega(G)\\alpha(G)$.\n4.  From $N \\le \\omega(G)\\alpha(G)$, it follows that $\\max(\\omega(G), \\alpha(G)) \\ge \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$.\n5.  The existence of an interval graph $G_0$ for which $\\max(\\omega(G_0), \\alpha(G_0)) = \\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$ shows this bound is tight.\n6.  For $N=2016$, $k = \\lceil\\sqrt{2016}\\rceil = 45$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{45}$.",

We model each customer by the time\u2010interval during which he or she is in the shop, and then apply a classical theorem of poset theory (Dilworth\u2019s theorem) together with the \u201cHelly property\u201d of intervals.\n\nProof.  Label the 2016 customers by \\(1,2,\\dots,2016\\).  For customer \\(i\\) let\n\\[\nI_i=[a_i,b_i]\n\\]\nbe the closed interval of times from when \\(i\\) enters the shop (\\(a_i\\)) to when \\(i\\) leaves (\\(b_i\\)), so \\(a_i<b_i\\).  \n\nDefine a partial order \u201c\\(<\\)\u201d on the set \\(\\{I_1,\\dots,I_{2016}\\}\\) by\n\\[\nI_i< I_j\n\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\nb_i < a_j.\n\\]\nIn words, \\(I_i<I_j\\) exactly when customer \\(i\\) has entirely left before customer \\(j\\) enters.  \n\n1.\u2003Chains and antichains in this poset correspond to the two configurations in the problem.\n\n  (a) A **chain** \\(I_{i_1}<I_{i_2}<\\cdots< I_{i_t}\\) is a set of intervals pairwise comparable under \u201c\\(<\\).\u201d  Hence\n  \\[\n  b_{i_1}<a_{i_2},\\;b_{i_2}<a_{i_3},\\;\\dots,\\;b_{i_{t-1}}<a_{i_t}.\n  \\]\n  In particular no two of these \\(t\\) intervals overlap; equivalently, these \\(t\\) customers form a set of \\(t\\) customers no two of whom were in the shop at the same time.  \n\n  (b) An **antichain** is a set of intervals no two of which are comparable, i.e.\\ for every pair \\(I_i,I_j\\) in the antichain, neither \\(b_i<a_j\\) nor \\(b_j<a_i\\) holds.  Equivalently each pair of intervals overlaps:\n  \\[\n  b_i\\ge a_j\n  \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n  b_j\\ge a_i.\n  \\]\n  We now invoke the well\u2010known *Helly property* of intervals on the real line:\n\n  Lemma (Helly for intervals).  If a finite family of closed intervals in \\(\\Bbb R\\) is pairwise intersecting, then all of them have a point in common.\n\n  Proof of the lemma:  Write the intervals as \\([a_i,b_i]\\).  Pairwise intersection means \\(a_i\\le b_j\\) for every \\(i,j\\).  Hence\n  \\[\n    \\max_i a_i\\;\\le\\;\\min_j b_j,\n  \\]\n  so the intersection\n  \\(\\bigcap_i[a_i,b_i]\\) contains the nonempty interval\n  \\([\\max_i a_i,\\min_j b_j]\\).\n  \\(\\square\\)\n\n  By Helly, any antichain of size \\(t\\) yields \\(t\\) intervals all of which contain the common point\n  \\(\\max_i a_i\\).  In the shop interpretation this is a set of \\(t\\) customers who were simultaneously in the shop at that moment.\n\nThus in our poset\n\u2013 a chain of size \\(k\\) is exactly a set of \\(k\\) mutually non\u2010overlapping customers,  \n\u2013 an antichain of size \\(k\\) is exactly a set of \\(k\\) customers all in the shop together at some instant.\n\n2.\u2003Dilworth\u2019s theorem and the \u201c\\((k-1)^2\\)\u201d bound.  \n\nRecall Dilworth\u2019s theorem (a standard result; see for instance the article \u201cDilworth\u2019s theorem\u201d on Wikipedia):\n\n Theorem (Dilworth).  In any finite poset, the minimum number of chains in a partition of the ground set equals the size of a largest antichain.\n\nNow suppose for some integer \\(k\\) that our 2016\u2010element poset has\n\\[\n\\text{no chain of size }k\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n\\text{no antichain of size }k.\n\\]\nThen\n\u2013 the largest antichain has size at most \\(k-1\\), so by Dilworth the poset can be partitioned into at most \\(k-1\\) chains;  \n\u2013 on the other hand, each chain (being a chain in which no \\(k\\) appear) has size at most \\(k-1\\).\n\nHence if both width and height are \\(<k\\), the total number of elements obeys\n\\[\n2016 \\;=\\;\\bigl|\\{I_1,\\dots,I_{2016}\\}\\bigr|\n\\;\\le\\;(k-1)\\times(k-1)=(k-1)^2.\n\\]\nEquivalently,\n\\[\n\\text{if }2016>(k-1)^2\\,,\\text{ then the poset must have either a chain of size }k\\text{ or an antichain of size }k.\n\\]\n\n3.\u2003Determination of the maximal \\(k\\).  \n\nWe seek the largest integer \\(k\\) for which \\(2016>(k-1)^2\\).  Compute\n\\[\n44^2=1936,\\quad 45^2=2025.\n\\]\nSince\n\\[\n1936 =44^2 <2016<45^2=2025,\n\\]\nwe have\n\\[\n(k-1)^2<2016\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad k-1\\le44\n\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad k\\le45,\n\\]\nbut for \\(k=46\\) one has \\((46-1)^2=45^2=2025>2016\\), so the inequality fails and the argument breaks down.  Therefore\n\n\u2013 For \\(k=45\\), \\(2016>44^2\\), so *every* arrangement of 2016 intervals contains either  \n   \u2022 a chain of size 45 (i.e.\\ 45 pairwise non\u2010overlapping customers), or  \n   \u2022 an antichain of size 45 (i.e.\\ 45 customers all in the shop at once).  \n\n\u2013 For \\(k=46\\), since \\(2016\\le45^2\\), one cannot force a chain or antichain of size 46 in all configurations.\n\nHence the **maximal** \\(k\\) with the required property is\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}.\n\\]\n\nThis completes the proof. \\(\\blacksquare\\)",

An example showing that 45 cannot be improved.\n\nIt suffices to construct 2016 intervals with\n\\(\\omega=\\alpha=45\\).\nDivide the real line into 45 pairwise disjoint \u201ctime windows\u201d\n\\[\nW_j=(2j,2j+1)\\qquad (j=1,2,\\dots ,45).\n\\]\nInside every window place several identical copies of the window itself;\nprecisely\n\n\u2022 in windows \\(W_1,\\dots ,W_9\\) place 44 copies each (total 396\nintervals),  \n\n\u2022 in windows \\(W_{10},\\dots ,W_{45}\\) place 45 copies each (total 1620\nintervals).\n\nThere are \\(396+1620=2016\\) intervals altogether.\n\nProperties of this family.\n\na)  Customers inside the same window are all present\nthroughout that entire window, so at any point belonging to \\(W_j\\)\nexactly the intervals situated in \\(W_j\\) are present.\nBecause each window contains at most 45 intervals,\n\\(\\omega=45\\).\n\nb)  Two intervals coming from different windows are disjoint,\nwhile two intervals taken from the same window intersect.\nThus in any pairwise disjoint subfamily at most one interval can be\nchosen from every window, so \\(\\alpha\\le 45\\).\nOn the other hand, choosing one interval from each window gives 45\npairwise disjoint intervals, therefore \\(\\alpha=45\\).\n\nHence \\(\\max(\\omega,\\alpha)=45\\) for this family; in particular no set\nof 46 customers has the required property.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  Conclusion.\n\nStatement (3) shows that one can always find such a set of\nsize \\(45\\), while the construction of \u00a73 shows that one cannot always\nfind one of size \\(46\\).\nTherefore the largest integer \\(k\\) that is guaranteed is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,k=45\\,}.\n\\]",

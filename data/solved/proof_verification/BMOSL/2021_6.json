            "solution": "Let $S_n$ be the set of numbers of the form $p+1$, where $p$ is a prime number such that $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $p \\nmid n$. We are looking for $G_n = \\gcd(S_n)$, the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $S_n$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nIf $p$ is a prime and $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $p+1 \\equiv 2+1 \\equiv 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\nThis means that every number $p+1$ in the set $S_n$ is divisible by 3.\nTherefore, $G_n$ must be divisible by 3. This implies $3 | G_n$.\n\nWe consider two cases based on the parity of $n$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd (i.e., $2 \\nmid n$).\nIn this case, the prime $p=2$ needs to be considered.\n$p=2$ satisfies $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nThe condition $p \\nmid n$ means $2 \\nmid n$. This is true for this case.\nSo, $p=2$ is one of the primes included in the definition of $S_n$.\nThe corresponding number $p+1$ is $2+1=3$.\nSo, $3 \\in S_n$.\nSince $G_n$ must divide every element in $S_n$, $G_n$ must divide 3.\nWe have $3 | G_n$ and $G_n | 3$. The only positive integer satisfying this is $G_n=3$.\nThus, if $n$ is odd, $G_n=3$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is even (i.e., $2 | n$).\nIn this case, the prime $p=2$ is a divisor of $n$.\nSo $p=2$ does not satisfy the condition $p \\nmid n$.\nThus, $p=2$ is not among the primes considered for $S_n$.\nThis means any prime $p$ contributing to $S_n$ must be an odd prime (since $p=2$ is the only even prime).\nIf $p$ is an odd prime, then $p+1$ is an even number.\nSo, every number $p+1$ in $S_n$ is divisible by 2.\nTherefore, $G_n$ must be divisible by 2.\nWe already know $3 | G_n$. Since $\\gcd(2,3)=1$, it follows that $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ must divide $G_n$. So $6 | G_n$.\n\nTo determine $G_n$ more precisely in this case ($2|n$), we investigate its prime factorization $G_n = 2^{v_2} 3^{v_3} 5^{v_5} \\dots$. We know $v_2 \\ge 1$ and $v_3 \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's examine $v_2(G_n)$.\nPrimes $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ can be classified by their residue modulo 12:\n$p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{12}$: $p=2$. (Since $12k+2 = 2(6k+1)$, $p=2$ is the only such prime). This prime is excluded because $2|n$.\n$p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$: For these primes, $p+1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{12}$. So $p+1 = 12k+6 = 6(2k+1)$. For these numbers, $v_2(p+1)=1$ (since $2k+1$ is odd). Examples: $p=5, 17, 29, ...$.\n$p \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$: For $k \\ge 0$, $12k+8 = 4(3k+2)$ is composite. Thus, no prime is of the form $12k+8$. (If $3k+2=1$, $3k=-1$, no integer $k$. If $3k+2$ is a prime, $4(3k+2)$ is composite. If $3k+2=-1$, $3k=-3$, $k=-1$, $p=12(-1)+8 = -4$, not a prime).\n$p \\equiv 11 \\pmod{12}$: For these primes, $p+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. So $v_2(p+1) \\ge 2$. Examples: $p=11, 23, ...$.\nBy Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, there are infinitely many primes of the form $12k+5$. Let this set of primes be $P_{5 \\pmod{12}}$.\nSince $n$ has a finite number of prime factors, $P_{5 \\pmod{12}} \\setminus \\{q | q \\text{ is a prime factor of } n\\}$ is an infinite set.\nThus, there exists a prime $p^* \\in P_{5 \\pmod{12}}$ such that $p^* \\nmid n$.\nNote that $p^* \\ne 2$ (since $2 \\not\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$) and $p^* \\ne 3$ (since $3 \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$).\nThis prime $p^*$ satisfies $p^* \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ (as $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$) and $p^* \\nmid n$. So $p^*+1 \\in S_n$.\nFor this $p^*$, $p^*+1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{12}$, which means $v_2(p^*+1)=1$.\nSince $G_n | (p^*+1)$, we must have $v_2(G_n) \\le v_2(p^*+1)=1$.\nAs $6 | G_n$, we have $v_2(G_n) \\ge 1$. So $v_2(G_n)=1$.\n\nLet's examine $v_3(G_n)$.\nPrimes $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ can be classified by their residue modulo 9:\n$p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$: For these primes, $p+1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 9$. So $v_3(p+1)=1$. Examples: $p=2, 11, 29, ...$.\n$p \\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$: For these primes, $p+1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$. So $v_3(p+1)=1$. Examples: $p=5, 23, ...$. ($p=41$ is $41 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$ and $41 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$).\n$p \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$: For these primes, $p+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$. So $v_3(p+1) \\ge 2$. Examples: $p=17, ...$.\nBy Dirichlet's Theorem, there are infinitely many primes of the form $9k+2$ and infinitely many primes of the form $9k+5$.\nLet $P_{2,5 \\pmod 9}$ be the set of primes $p$ such that $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$ or $p \\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$. This set is infinite.\nSince $n$ has a finite number of prime factors and $2|n$ (so $p=2$ is excluded from $P_n$), $(P_{2,5 \\pmod 9} \\setminus \\{2\\}) \\setminus \\{q | q \\text{ is a prime factor of } n\\}$ is an infinite set.\nThus, there exists a prime $p' \\in P_{2,5 \\pmod 9}$, $p' \\ne 2$, such that $p' \\nmid n$.\nThis prime $p'$ satisfies $p' \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ (as $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ and $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$) and $p' \\nmid n$. Also $p' \\ne 3$ (as $3 \\not\\equiv 2,5 \\pmod 9$). So $p'+1 \\in S_n$.\nFor this $p'$, $p'+1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 9$ or $p'+1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$. In both cases, $v_3(p'+1)=1$.\nSince $G_n | (p'+1)$, we must have $v_3(G_n) \\le v_3(p'+1)=1$.\nAs $3 | G_n$, we have $v_3(G_n) \\ge 1$. So $v_3(G_n)=1$.\n\nLet's examine $v_q(G_n)$ for any prime $q > 3$.\nWe want to show $v_q(G_n)=0$. This means $q \\nmid G_n$.\nTo show this, we need to find a prime $p^{**}$ such that $p^{**} \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, $p^{**} \\nmid n$, and $q \\nmid (p^{**}+1)$.\nThe condition $q \\nmid (p^{**}+1)$ is equivalent to $p^{**} \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod q$.\nConsider the system of congruences:\n$x \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$\n$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$\nSince $q>3$, $q$ is not $3$. So $\\gcd(3,q)=1$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), there is a unique solution $x_0$ modulo $3q$.\nWe need to check if $\\gcd(x_0, 3q)=1$.\n$x_0 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3 \\implies 3 \\nmid x_0$.\n$x_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q \\implies q \\nmid x_0$.\nSo $\\gcd(x_0, 3q)=1$.\nBy Dirichlet's Theorem, there are infinitely many primes $p \\equiv x_0 \\pmod{3q}$. Let this set be $P_{x_0 \\pmod{3q}}$.\nThese primes satisfy $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ and $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$.\nFor such a prime $p$, $p+1 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod q$.\nSince $q>3$, $q \\nmid 2$. So $q \\nmid (p+1)$.\nSince $n$ has a finite number of prime factors, $P_{x_0 \\pmod{3q}} \\setminus \\{r | r \\text{ is a prime factor of } n\\}$ is an infinite set.\nThus, there exists a prime $p^{**}$ in this set such that $p^{**} \\nmid n$.\nThis prime $p^{**}$ satisfies $p^{**} \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ and $p^{**} \\nmid n$.\nThis $p^{**}$ cannot be $2$: $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ implies $q=1$, which is not possible.\nThis $p^{**}$ cannot be $3$: $3 \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\nSo $p^{**}+1 \\in S_n$.\nFor this $p^{**}$, $q \\nmid (p^{**}+1)$.\nSince $G_n | (p^{**}+1)$, it must be that $q \\nmid G_n$.\nSo $v_q(G_n)=0$ for any prime $q>3$.\n\nCombining these results for the case $2|n$:\n$v_2(G_n)=1$.\n$v_3(G_n)=1$.\n$v_q(G_n)=0$ for all primes $q>3$.\nSo $G_n = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nIn summary:\nIf $n$ is odd ($2 \\nmid n$), $G_n=3$.\nIf $n$ is even ($2 | n$), $G_n=6$.\n\nThe result can be stated as: the greatest integer is 3 if $n$ is odd, and 6 if $n$ is even.\n\nFinal check:\nThe set $S_n$ is non-empty. Dirichlet's theorem guarantees there are infinitely many primes $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Since $n$ has finitely many prime factors, there are infinitely many primes $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ such that $p \\nmid n$.\n\nExample: $n=1$ (odd). $G_1=3$.

            "solution": "Let \\( n \\) be a positive integer. The task is to determine the greatest integer that divides every number of the form \\( p+1 \\), where \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) is a prime number that does not divide \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, note that for any prime \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), it follows that \\( p + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\), so 3 divides \\( p + 1 \\). Additionally, if \\( p > 2 \\), then \\( p \\) is odd, so \\( p + 1 \\) is even and thus divisible by 2. However, when \\( p = 2 \\), which satisfies \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), \\( p + 1 = 3 \\), which is odd and not divisible by 2.\n\nThe condition that \\( p \\) does not divide \\( n \\) determines whether \\( p = 2 \\) is included in the set of primes under consideration. Specifically, \\( p = 2 \\) does not divide \\( n \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is odd, meaning 2 does not divide \\( n \\). Define \\( d = \\gcd(2, n) \\). Then \\( d = 1 \\) if \\( n \\) is odd, and \\( d = 2 \\) if \\( n \\) is even. The claim is that the greatest integer dividing all such \\( p + 1 \\) is \\( 3d \\).\n\n### Proof that \\( 3d \\) divides every \\( p + 1 \\)\n\n- If \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( d = 1 \\) and \\( 3d = 3 \\). Since \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) for all such primes, \\( p + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\), so 3 divides \\( p + 1 \\).\n- If \\( n \\) is even, then \\( d = 2 \\) and \\( 3d = 6 \\). In this case, \\( p = 2 \\) is excluded because 2 divides \\( n \\), so all primes \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) in the set satisfy \\( p \\geq 5 \\). Such \\( p \\) are odd and \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), so \\( p + 1 \\) is even and divisible by 3, hence divisible by 6.\n\nThus, \\( 3d \\) divides every \\( p + 1 \\) for primes \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) not dividing \\( n \\).\n\n### Proof that \\( 3d \\) is the greatest such integer\n\n- If \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( d = 1 \\) and \\( 3d = 3 \\). Since \\( n \\) is odd, 2 does not divide \\( n \\), so \\( p = 2 \\) is in the set and \\( p + 1 = 3 \\). Any common divisor of all \\( p + 1 \\) must divide 3. Since 3 divides all \\( p + 1 \\), the greatest such divisor is 3.\n- If \\( n \\) is even, then \\( d = 2 \\) and \\( 3d = 6 \\). It has been shown that 6 divides all such \\( p + 1 \\). To show that no larger integer divides all such \\( p + 1 \\), consider that for any prime \\( q > 3 \\), there exists a prime \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) such that \\( p + 1 \\) is not divisible by \\( q \\). For example, choose \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) and \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q} \\) (if \\( q \\) is odd), so \\( p + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{q} \\neq 0 \\). By Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, there are infinitely many such primes, so one can be chosen that does not divide \\( n \\) and is in the set. Thus, no prime \\( q > 3 \\) divides all \\( p + 1 \\) in the set.\n\nAdditionally, for the prime 2, there exist primes \\( p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) in the set such that \\( p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12} \\), so \\( p + 1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{12} \\), which is divisible by 2 but not by 4. Similarly, for the prime 3, there exist \\( p + 1 \\) divisible by 3 but not by 9 (e.g., \\( p = 5 \\), \\( p + 1 = 6 \\), or if excluded, \\( p = 11 \\), \\( p + 1 = 12 \\)). Thus, the highest powers are \\( 2^1 \\) and \\( 3^1 \\), so the greatest common divisor is 6.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, the greatest integer is \\( 3 \\gcd(2, n) \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3\\,\\gcd \\left(2,\\,n\\right)}\n\\]",

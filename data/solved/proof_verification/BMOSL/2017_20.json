            "solution": "The hunter can always catch the grasshopper in finite time by using a systematic enumeration strategy based on the countable set of possible starting points and jump vectors. Below is a complete and self-contained proof.\n\n---\n\n**Proof:**\n\nThe grasshopper starts at some integer point \\((x_0^*, y_0^*) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) at time \\(t = 0\\) and jumps with a constant jump vector \\((a^*, b^*) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) each second. Thus, at time \\(t \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}\\), the position of the grasshopper is given by:\n\\[\n(x_0^* + a^* \\cdot t, \\, y_0^* + b^* \\cdot t).\n\\]\nThe hunter does not know \\((x_0^*, y_0^*)\\) or \\((a^*, b^*)\\), but knows that both are integer-valued and that the jump vector is constant. The hunter's goal is to choose a point to check at each time \\(t\\) such that, for any fixed \\((x_0^*, y_0^*, a^*, b^*)\\), there exists some finite time \\(t\\) where the hunter's chosen point matches the grasshopper's position.\n\nFirst, note that the set of all possible quadruples \\((x_0, y_0, a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^4\\) is countable because \\(\\mathbb{Z}^4\\) is a countable union of countable sets (since each component is countable). Therefore, an enumeration of all such quadruples exists. Define a sequence of quadruples \\((x_k, y_k, a_k, b_k)\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\) that includes every possible \\((x_0, y_0, a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^4\\) exactly once. Such an enumeration can be constructed, for example, by ordering the quadruples first by the sum of absolute values \\(|x_0| + |y_0| + |a| + |b|\\), and then lexicographically within each sum to ensure all quadruples are listed.\n\nThe hunter employs the following strategy: at each time step \\(t = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\), the hunter assumes that the quadruple \\((x_t, y_t, a_t, b_t)\\) (the \\(t\\)-th quadruple in the enumeration) is the true one and checks the point where this hypothetical grasshopper would be at time \\(t\\). Specifically, the hunter visits the point:\n\\[\n(p_x(t), p_y(t)) = (x_t + a_t \\cdot t, \\, y_t + b_t \\cdot t).\n\\]\n\nNow, consider the true quadruple \\((x_0^*, y_0^*, a^*, b^*)\\). Since the enumeration includes all possible quadruples, there exists some finite index \\(m \\geq 0\\) such that \\((x_m, y_m, a_m, b_m) = (x_0^*, y_0^*, a^*, b^*)\\). At time \\(t = m\\), the hunter visits:\n\\[\n(p_x(m), p_y(m)) = (x_m + a_m \\cdot m, \\, y_m + b_m \\cdot m) = (x_0^* + a^* \\cdot m, \\, y_0^* + b^* \\cdot m),\n\\]\nbecause \\((x_m, y_m, a_m, b_m) = (x_0^*, y_0^*, a^*, b^*)\\). Meanwhile, the actual position of the grasshopper at time \\(t = m\\) is:\n\\[\n(x_0^* + a^* \\cdot m, \\, y_0^* + b^* \\cdot m).\n\\]\nThus, the hunter's chosen point \\((p_x(m), p_y(m))\\) matches the grasshopper's position at time \\(m\\), and the hunter catches the grasshopper.\n\nSince \\(m\\) is finite for any fixed true quadruple \\((x_0^*, y_0^*, a^*, b^*)\\), the capture occurs in finite time. This strategy works regardless of the specific values of \\(x_0^*\\), \\(y_0^*\\), \\(a^*\\), and \\(b^*\\), as long as they are fixed integers. Therefore, the hunter can always catch the grasshopper in finite time.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}",

Since these are all integers, the set of all such trajectories is countable. We can enumerate them as a sequence:\n   $$\n   Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \\dots\n   $$\n   where each $Q_n = (x_0^{(n)}, y_0^{(n)}, dx^{(n)}, dy^{(n)})$.\n\n2. **Hunter's Strategy**:  \n   The hunter can choose a sequence of points $(a_t, b_t)$ to check at time $t$. The goal is to ensure that for **some finite** $t$, the point $(a_t, b_t)$ coincides with the grasshopper's position at time $t$, i.e.,\n   $$\n   (a_t, b_t) = (x_0 + dx \\cdot t, y_0 + dy \\cdot t)\n   $$\n   for the grasshopper's unknown trajectory.\n\n3. **Diagonalization Strategy**:  \n   The hunter can use a **diagonalization** approach. Specifically, the hunter can:\n   - Enumerate all possible grasshopper trajectories $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \\dots$.\n   - At time $t$, the hunter checks the position of the $t$-th trajectory at time $t$, i.e., checks:\n     $$\n     (x_0^{(t)} + dx^{(t)} \\cdot t, y_0^{(t)} + dy^{(t)} \\cdot t)\n     $$\n   - Since the grasshopper follows **some** trajectory $Q_m$, and the hunter checks the $m$-th trajectory at time $m$, the hunter will catch the grasshopper at time $t = m$, which is finite.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works**\n\n- The enumeration of all possible grasshopper trajectories is **possible** because the set of integer quadruples $(x_0, y_0, dx, dy)$ is countable.\n- The hunter's strategy is **well-defined** and **guarantees** that for any grasshopper trajectory, there is a finite time $t$ when the hunter checks the grasshopper's position.\n- The strategy does **not** require the hunter to know the grasshopper's trajectory in advance. It only requires that the hunter can follow a fixed sequence of guesses that eventually covers every possible trajectory at some finite time.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe hunter can indeed always catch the grasshopper in finite time by enumerating all possible grasshopper trajectories and checking the position of the $t$-th trajectory at time $t$. This guarantees that for any grasshopper trajectory, the hunter will eventually check the grasshopper's position at the correct time.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{Yes}\n$$",

            "solution": "Yes, the hunter can always catch the grasshopper in a finite amount of time. Here is a proof.\n\n**1. Problem Formulation**\n\nLet the position of the grasshopper at time $t$ be $P_t \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$. Time $t$ is a non-negative integer, i.e., $t \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe initial position of the grasshopper at $t=0$ is $P_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\nThe grasshopper has a constant jump vector $V \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$. So, its position at time $t$ is given by the formula:\n\\\\[ P_t = P_0 + tV \\\\]\nThe problem states that \"Each second it jumps to another integer point\". This means that $P_{k} \\neq P_{k-1}$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n$P_k - P_{k-1} = (P_0 + kV) - (P_0 + (k-1)V) = V$.\nSo, $P_k \\neq P_{k-1}$ implies $V \\neq (0,0)$. The jump vector $V$ must be non-zero.\nThe set of all possible initial positions is $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The set of all possible jump vectors is $\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nA specific grasshopper behavior is determined by the pair $(P_0, V)$.\n\nThe hunter does not know $P_0$ or $V$. At each time $t \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$, the hunter can choose one integer point $H_t \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ to check. If the grasshopper is at that point at that time (i.e., $P_t = H_t$), it is caught.\nWe need to show that there exists a strategy for the hunter (a sequence of choices $H_0, H_1, H_2, \\ldots$) such that for any pair $(P_0, V)$, the grasshopper is caught in a finite amount of time.\n\n**2. The Set of Grasshopper Behaviors is Countable**\n\nA grasshopper's behavior is entirely determined by the pair $(P_0, V)$, where $P_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be the set of all such pairs:\n\\\\[ \\mathcal{C} = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}) \\\\]\nWe will show that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a countably infinite set.\n*   The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$ is countable. A known bijection $f: \\mathbb{N}_0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is, for example, $f(n) = (-1)^n \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n*   If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, their Cartesian product $A \\times B$ is also countable.\n    Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is countable, $\\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ is countable.\n*   The set $\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ is obtained by removing a single element $((0,0))$ from the countably infinite set $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ is also countably infinite.\n*   The set $\\mathcal{C}$ is the Cartesian product of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. Both are countable sets, so $\\mathcal{C}$ is also countable.\n\n**3. Enumeration of Grasshopper Behaviors**\n\nSince $\\mathcal{C}$ is countable, we can create an exhaustive list (an enumeration) of all possible grasshopper behaviors. Let $\\Psi: \\mathbb{N}_0 \\to \\mathcal{C}$ be such an enumeration. For each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$, $\\Psi(k)$ corresponds to a unique pair $(P_0^{(k)}, V^{(k)})$, where $P_0^{(k)}$ is the initial position and $V^{(k)}$ is the jump vector for the $k$-th behavior in our list.\nThis list $(P_0^{(0)}, V^{(0)}), (P_0^{(1)}, V^{(1)}), (P_0^{(2)}, V^{(2)}), \\ldots$ includes every possible behavior $(P_0,V)$ satisfying the problem conditions.\n\n**4. The Hunter's Strategy**\n\nThe hunter can use the enumeration $\\Psi$ to define their strategy. At each time $t \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$, the hunter decides to check the point $H_t$ that corresponds to the $t$-th behavior in the list, $\\Psi(t)=(P_0^{(t)}, V^{(t)})$. Specifically, the hunter checks the point where the grasshopper following behavior $\\Psi(t)$ would be at time $t$.\nSo, the hunter's strategy is:\n\\\\[ H_t = P_0^{(t)} + tV^{(t)} \\\\]\nSince $P_0^{(t)} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $V^{(t)} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$, and $t$ is an integer, $tV^{(t)}$ is also an integer vector. Thus, $H_t$ is an integer point in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, so it is a valid point for the hunter to check.\n\n**5. Proof of Guaranteed Capture in Finite Time**\n\nNow, we prove that this strategy guarantees that the hunter catches the grasshopper in a finite amount of time, regardless of what the grasshopper's actual $P_0$ and $V$ are.\n\nLet the grasshopper's actual initial position be $P_0^*$ and its actual jump vector be $V^*$. According to the problem's conditions, $P_0^* \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $V^* \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nSo the pair $(P_0^*, V^*)$ is one of the behaviors in the set $\\mathcal{C}$.\nSince $\\Psi$ is an enumeration of all behaviors in $\\mathcal{C}$, there must exist some index $j \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$ such that this specific pair $(P_0^*, V^*)$ is the $j$-th behavior in our list:\n\\\\[ (P_0^*, V^*) = \\Psi(j) = (P_0^{(j)}, V^{(j)}) \\\\]\nNow, let's consider what happens at time $t=j$:\n*   The actual position of the grasshopper at time $t=j$ is $P_j^* = P_0^* + jV^*$.\n*   According to the hunter's strategy, the point checked by the hunter at time $t=j$ is $H_j = P_0^{(j)} + jV^{(j)}$.\n\nSubstituting $P_0^* = P_0^{(j)}$ and $V^* = V^{(j)}$, the grasshopper's actual position at time $t=j$ is:\n\\\\[ P_j^* = P_0^{(j)} + jV^{(j)} \\\\]\nComparing this with the hunter's chosen point $H_j$, we see that $P_j^* = H_j$.\nThis means that at time $t=j$, the grasshopper is located at the exact point $H_j$ that the hunter checks. Therefore, the grasshopper is caught.\n\nSince $j$ is the index of the grasshopper's behavior in the enumeration, $j$ is a finite non-negative integer. Thus, the grasshopper is always caught at a finite time $j$.\n\n**6. Note on the condition $V \\neq (0,0)$**\n\nThe problem statement \"Each second it jumps to another integer point\" implies $V \\neq (0,0)$. If we were to allow $V=(0,0)$, the set of behaviors would be $\\mathcal{C}' = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^4$. This set $\\mathcal{C}'$ is also countable. The same argument would follow:\n1. Enumerate all pairs in $\\mathbb{Z}^4$ as $(P_0^{(k)}, V^{(k)})$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$.\n2. The hunter's strategy is $H_t = P_0^{(t)} + tV^{(t)}$.\n3. If the grasshopper's state is $(P_0^{(j)}, V^{(j)})$, it is caught at time $t=j$ because its position $P_0^{(j)} + jV^{(j)}$ will be equal to $H_j$.\nSo, the conclusion holds even if $V=(0,0)$ is allowed.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe hunter can define a strategy by enumerating all possible grasshopper behaviors $(P_0^{(k)}, V^{(k)})$ and checking the point $P_0^{(t)} + tV^{(t)}$ at time $t$. This strategy guarantees that any grasshopper, characterized by a pair $(P_0, V)$, will be caught at time $j$ where $j$ is the index of $(P_0, V)$ in the enumeration. Since $j$ is finite, the hunter always catches the grasshopper in a finite amount of time.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

We will exhibit an explicit \u201cuniversal\u201d strategy for the hunter, based only on the fact that \\(\\Bbb Z\\) is countable and hence so is \\(\\Bbb Z^4\\).\n\n1.  Since \\(\\Bbb Z\\) is countable, the Cartesian product \\(\\Bbb Z^4\\) is countable.  Therefore there exists a surjection\n   \\[\n     f\\;:\\;\\Bbb N\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\Bbb Z^4,\\qquad\n     f(t)=(x_t,y_t,a_t,b_t)\\,.\n   \\]\n   In other words, as \\(t\\) runs through the positive integers, the quadruple \\((x_t,y_t,a_t,b_t)\\) runs through every element of \\(\\Bbb Z^4\\).\n\n2.  We now describe the hunter\u2019s strategy.  At the \\(t\\)-th second (for \\(t=1,2,3,\\dots\\)), the hunter \u201cprobes\u201d the single lattice point\n   \\[\n     H_t \\;=\\;\\bigl(x_t + a_t\\,t,\\;y_t + b_t\\,t\\bigr)\\;\\in\\;\\Bbb Z^2.\n   \\]\n   That is, he chooses to check exactly that point at time \\(t\\).\n\n3.  Let \\((x_0,y_0)\\in\\Bbb Z^2\\) be the grasshopper\u2019s (unknown) starting point and \\((a,b)\\in\\Bbb Z^2\\) its (unknown) constant jump vector.  By surjectivity of \\(f\\), there is some index \\(N\\in\\Bbb N\\) for which\n   \\[\n     f(N)\\;=\\;(x_N,y_N,a_N,b_N)\\;=\\;(x_0,y_0,a,b).\n   \\]\n   But then at time \\(N\\) the grasshopper\u2019s position is\n   \\[\n     (x_0 + a\\,N,\\;y_0 + b\\,N),\n   \\]\n   and by the definition of our strategy the hunter probes precisely the point\n   \\[\n     H_N \\;=\\;\\bigl(x_N + a_N\\,N,\\;y_N + b_N\\,N\\bigr)\n          \\;=\\;(x_0 + a\\,N,\\;y_0 + b\\,N).\n   \\]\n   Hence at time \\(N\\) the hunter\u2019s probe coincides with the grasshopper\u2019s position, and the grasshopper is caught.\n\n4.  Because \\(N\\) is finite, this shows that no matter what the (unknown) initial data \\((x_0,y_0,a,b)\\) are, the hunter\u2019s strategy succeeds in finitely many steps.\n\nThis completes the proof that the hunter can always catch the grasshopper in finite time. \u220e",

There's also a sequence of \\(2n+1\\) consecutive cells enumerated from \\(1\\) to \\(2n+1\\) from left to right, such that initially the number \\(a_i\\) is written on the \\(i\\)-th cell, for \\(i=1, 2, \\ldots, 2n+1\\). Starting from this initial position, we repeat the following sequence of steps, as long as it's possible:\n\nStep 1: Add up the numbers written on all the cells, denote the sum as \\(s\\).\nStep 2: If \\(s\\) is equal to \\(0\\) or if it is larger than the current number of cells, the process terminates. Otherwise, remove the \\(s\\)-th cell, and shift all cells that are to the right of it one position to the left. Then go to Step 1.\n\nExample: \\((1,0,1, \\underline{2}, 0) \\rightarrow(1, \\underline{0}, 1,0) \\rightarrow(1, \\underline{1}, 0) \\rightarrow(\\underline{1}, 0) \\rightarrow(0)\\).\n\nA sequence \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2n+1}\\) of non-negative integers is called balanced if at the end of this process there's exactly one cell left, and it's the cell that was initially enumerated by \\(n+1\\), i.e., the cell that was initially in the middle.\n\nFind the total number of balanced sequences as a function of \\(n\\).",

            "solution": "Solution. The answer is: $C_{n} \\cdot C_{n}$, where $C_{n}=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2 n}{n}$ is the $n$-th Catalan number.\nWe divide the proof into several steps. First, some terminology: the last (rightmost) $n$ cells will be called the back cells and the front (leftmost) $n$ cells will be called the front cells. The central, $(n+1)$-st, cell will be called the middle cell.\n\nClaim 1. All the back cells must be removed before any front cell is removed.\nProof. Assume for contradiction that this is not the case. Then there must be a point in time where a front cell is deleted and then immediately after a back cell is deleted. Let us say that the deleted front cell was at position $i$. So all back cells have positions greater or equal to $i+2$. After the cell is deleted all back cells have positions greater or equal to $i+1$. But since we deleted cell $i$, then the total sum is $i$ and this does not increase. So at the next step we delete a cell at position at most $i$, a contradiction.\n\nClaim 2. The middle cell must contain the number $0$, i.e., $a_{n+1}=0$.\nProof. Consider the last step in the process where we have total of $2$ cells. One of these is the middle cell, and by Claim $1$ the other must be one of the front cells. I.e. we have $\\left(x, a_{n+1}\\right)$. On the next move, we remove $x$, which means that $x+a_{n+1}=1$. So $a_{n+1}=0$ or $a_{n+1}=1$. But after that we cannot remove $a_{n+1}$, which means that $a_{n+1} \\neq 1$. So $a_{n+1}=0$.\n\nNow, let's define a self-destructing sequence to be one with no surviving cells at the end of the process. For example, $(0,1,2)$ is self-destructing because $(0,1,2) \\rightarrow(0,1) \\rightarrow(1) \\rightarrow()$.\nLet $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$ be the set of self-destructing sequences of length $n$. For example, $\\mathcal{S}_{2}=\\{(0,1),(1,1)\\}$. It is clear that the front cells form a self-destructing sequence, i.e., $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots a_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{S}_{n}$. The back cells also have certain self-destructing quality, which is made more precise in Claim $3$ below.\n\nClaim 3. Fix the front sequence $\\varphi=\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}\\right)$. Let $\\mathcal{B}_{\\phi}$ be the set of all possible back sequences of length $n$ that can be appended to $\\varphi$ (with a $0$ between them) to get a balanced sequence. Then there is a bijection $f: \\mathcal{S}_{n} \\mapsto \\mathcal{B}_{\\phi}$.\n\nProof. Let $c=n+1-\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}$ and consider a particular $\\sigma=\\left(s_{1}, s_{2}, \\ldots, s_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{S}_{n}$. Let $\\ell$ be the initial index of the last surviving cell in $\\sigma$. Then $f(\\sigma)=\\left(s_{1}, s_{2}, \\ldots, s_{\\ell}+c, s_{\\ell+1}, \\ldots, s_{n}\\right)$ defines a bijection $\\mathcal{S}_{n} \\mapsto \\mathcal{B}_{\\phi}$.\n\nIndeed we claim that the $k$-th deleted cell in $\\sigma$ is the $k$-th deleted cell in $\\overline{\\varphi 0 f(\\sigma)}$ for each $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Indeed after some deletions let $S$ be the total sum remaining in $\\sigma$. Then the total sum remaining in $\\overline{\\varphi 0 f(\\sigma)}$ is $-\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}+0+S+c=S+n+1$. So we delete next the cell in position $S$ in $\\sigma$ if and only if we delete the cell in position $S+n+1$ in $\\overline{\\varphi 0 f(\\sigma)}$.\nSo $\\overline{\\phi 0 f(\\sigma)}$ is clearly a balanced sequence: we first eliminate all cells in the back, then the front. In the same manner it follows that every balanced sequence in of this form.\n\nSo far we have shown that the total number of balanced sequences is $\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{n}\\right|^{2}$. It remains to calculate the size $\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{n}\\right|$.\n\nClaim 4. Let $\\mathcal{T}_{n}$ be the set of $2 n$-sequences consisting of $n$ zeros and $n$ ones such that in each initial segment the number of 1's does not surpass the number of $0$ 's. Then $\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{n}\\right|=\\left|\\mathcal{T}_{n}\\right|$.\n\nProof. Let $[n]=\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$, and let us also consider the set $\\mathcal{F}_{n}$ of non-decreasing mappings $f:[n] \\rightarrow[n]$ such that $f(i) \\leqslant i$ for each $i \\in[n]$. The claim will follow once we show that $\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{n}\\right|=\\left|\\mathcal{F}_{n}\\right|$ and that $\\left|\\mathcal{F}_{n}\\right|=\\left|\\mathcal{T}_{n}\\right|$.\n\nIn order to demonstrate that $\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{n}\\right|=\\left|\\mathcal{F}_{n}\\right|$, observe that there is an obvious bijective correspondence $a \\mapsto f$ between the sets $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{n}$. Indeed, reversing the self-destructing process for an $n$-sequence $a=\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{S}_{n}$, simply define $f(i)$ to be the (partial) sum of the existing terms after the $i$-th backward step.\n\nAs for $\\left|\\mathcal{T}_{n}\\right|=\\left|\\mathcal{F}_{n}\\right|$, note the following bijective correspondence $t \\mapsto f$ between the sets $\\mathcal{T}_{n}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{n}$. Let $f(i)$ equal $1+\\#(i)$, where $\\#(i)$ is defined to be the total number of $1^{\\prime} s$ appearing in $t$ before the $i$-th zero.\n\nFinally, it is a known fact that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{n}\\right|$ is the $n$-th Catalan number $C_{n}=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2 n}{n}$. (The essential idea of the textbook proof of this fact uses the so-called reflection principle of A. D. Andr\u0413\u00a9.)",

            "solution": "To determine the number of **balanced sequences** of length $2n+1$, we must understand the process of repeatedly summing the elements of the sequence and removing the $s$-th cell (where $s$ is the current sum), until only one cell remains. A sequence is **balanced** if the remaining cell is the **original middle** one, i.e., the cell that was at position $n+1$ in the original sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The sequence has $2n+1$ non-negative integers.\n   - The process removes one cell per iteration, reducing the number of cells by 1 each time.\n   - To end up with exactly one cell (the original middle one), the process must run **exactly $2n$** times.\n\n2. **Valid Removals**:\n   - At each step, the sum $s$ must satisfy $1 \\leq s \\leq \\text{current length}$.\n   - If $s = 0$ or $s > \\text{current length}$, the process terminates early, which we **do not want**.\n\n3. **Invariant**:\n   - The **original middle cell** (position $n+1$) must **never be removed** during the process.\n   - This means that at each step, the $s$-th cell removed must **not** be the one that corresponds to the original middle cell.\n\n4. **Reverse Process**:\n   - Instead of thinking forward, we can **build the sequence in reverse**, starting from the final middle cell.\n   - At each reverse step, we insert a new cell either to the **left** or **right** of the current sequence.\n   - The value of the inserted cell is determined by the sum of the current sequence and the position of the insertion.\n   - This reverse process must ensure that the original middle cell remains at the center of the final sequence.\n\n5. **Combinatorial Structure**:\n   - The number of such reverse processes that result in a valid balanced sequence corresponds to the number of **Dyck paths** of length $2n$.\n   - A Dyck path is a lattice path from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$ that never goes below the diagonal.\n   - Each step in the path corresponds to an insertion (either left or right), and the path must stay above the diagonal to ensure the original middle cell remains at the center.\n\n6. **Catalan Numbers**:\n   - The number of Dyck paths of length $2n$ is the **$n$-th Catalan number**, given by:\n     $$\n     C_n = \\frac{1}{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n}\n     $$\n   - This is the number of valid insertion sequences that preserve the position of the original middle cell and ensure that the process ends with exactly one cell.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nEach balanced sequence corresponds uniquely to a Dyck path of length $2n$, and each Dyck path corresponds to a unique balanced sequence. Therefore, the number of balanced sequences of length $2n+1$ is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{n+1} \\dbinom{2n}{n}}\n$$",

            "solution": "Let $N_j$ be the number of cells at the beginning of step $j$. Initially $N_1 = 2n+1$.\nLet $a^{(j)}_i$ be the value in the $i$-th cell at step $j$, and $c^{(j)}_i$ be its initial index.\nLet $s_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_j} a^{(j)}_i$.\nThe process removes $2n$ cells one by one, so $N_{j+1} = N_j-1$. $N_{2n+1}=1$.\nThe process terminates if $s_j=0$ or $s_j > N_j$. For a sequence to be balanced, this condition must not be met for $j=1, \\ldots, 2n$. So $1 \\le s_j \\le N_j$ for $j=1, \\ldots, 2n$.\nWhen $N_{2n+1}=1$, cell $C^*$ (initial index $n+1$) remains. Let its value be $a_{n+1}$.\nThe sum is $s_{2n+1}=a_{n+1}$. The process must terminate at this point.\nThis means $a_{n+1}=0$ or $a_{n+1} > N_{2n+1}=1$. So $a_{n+1} \\neq 1$.\n\nLet $p_j$ be the position of $C^*$ in the list of cells at step $j$. Initially $p_1=n+1$.\nThe cell $C^*$ must not be removed. So $s_j \\neq p_j$ for $j=1, \\ldots, 2n$.\nIf cell $s_j < p_j$ is removed (L-move), then $p_{j+1}=p_j-1$.\nIf cell $s_j > p_j$ is removed (R-move), then $p_{j+1}=p_j$.\nTo have $C^*$ as the only remaining cell, we must remove all $n$ cells initially to its left and all $n$ cells initially to its right. This means there must be exactly $n$ L-moves and $n$ R-moves during the $2n$ steps.\n\nLet $v_j = a^{(j)}_{s_j}$ be the value of the cell removed at step $j$.\nThen $s_{j+1} = s_j - v_j$. Since $a_i \\ge 0$, $v_j \\ge 0$. So $s_j$ is a non-increasing sequence: $s_1 \\ge s_2 \\ge \\ldots \\ge s_{2n} \\ge s_{2n+1}=a_{n+1}$.\nThe values of the cells removed are $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{2n}$. These are the initial values $a_i$ for $i \\neq n+1$, in some order.\nSo $\\{a_i \\mid i \\neq n+1\\} = \\{v_j \\mid j=1, \\ldots, 2n\\}$ as multisets.\nAll $a_i$ must be non-negative integers. So $v_j = s_j - s_{j+1} \\ge 0$.\n\nCase $n=0$: The sequence is $(a_1)$. $2n+1=1$. $C^*$ is $a_1$. No cells are removed.\nThe condition $a_{n+1} \\ne 1$ becomes $a_1 \\ne 1$.\nThe process terminates before removing any cell if $s_1=0$ or $s_1 > N_1=1$. So $a_1=0$ or $a_1>1$.\nThus for $n=0$, any sequence $(a_1)$ with $a_1 \\neq 1$ is balanced. There are infinitely many such sequences.\nThe problem probably implies $n \\ge 1$. If not, the answer is infinite. Let's assume $n \\ge 1$.\n\nConsider $n=1$. Sequence $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$. $C^*=a_2$. So $a_2 \\ne 1$.\n$N_1=3, N_2=2, N_3=1$. $p_1=2$. We need 1 L-move and 1 R-move.\n\nPath 1: L-move then R-move.\nStep 1 (L-move): $s_1 < p_1=2$. Since $s_1 \\ge 1$, we must have $s_1=1$.\nThe first cell $c^{(1)}_1$ (which is $a_1$) is removed. $v_1=a_1$.\n$p_2 = p_1-1=1$. The cells are $(a_2, a_3)$ (initial indices).\nStep 2 (R-move): $s_2 > p_2=1$. $N_2=2$. So $s_2=2$.\nThe second cell $c^{(2)}_2$ (which is $a_3$) is removed. $v_2=a_3$.\n$p_3 = p_2=1$. The cell $a_2$ remains.\nFrom $s_1 \\ge s_2 \\ge a_2$: $1 \\ge 2 \\ge a_2$. This is impossible.\nSo this path $(s_1,s_2)=(1,2)$ is not possible.\nTo be more explicit: $a_1=v_1=s_1-s_2 = 1-2 = -1$. This is not allowed, as $a_i \\ge 0$.\n\nPath 2: R-move then L-move.\nStep 1 (R-move): $s_1 > p_1=2$. $N_1=3$. So $s_1=3$.\nThe third cell $c^{(1)}_3$ (which is $a_3$) is removed. $v_1=a_3$.\n$p_2 = p_1=2$. The cells are $(a_1, a_2)$ (initial indices).\nStep 2 (L-move): $s_2 < p_2=2$. $N_2=2$. So $s_2=1$.\nThe first cell $c^{(2)}_1$ (which is $a_1$) is removed. $v_2=a_1$.\n$p_3 = p_2-1=1$. The cell $a_2$ remains.\nThe condition $s_1 \\ge s_2 \\ge a_2$ is $3 \\ge 1 \\ge a_2$. This is possible.\nWe have $v_1=a_3=s_1-s_2 = 3-1=2$. So $a_3=2$.\nWe have $v_2=a_1=s_2-s_3 = s_2-a_2 = 1-a_2$.\nSince $a_1 \\ge 0$, $1-a_2 \\ge 0 \\implies a_2 \\le 1$.\nWe know $a_2 \\ne 1$. So $a_2 < 1$. Since $a_2 \\ge 0$, $a_2=0$.\nThen $a_1=1-0=1$.\nThe sequence is $(a_1,a_2,a_3)=(1,0,2)$. This is a balanced sequence.\nLet's verify: $(1,0,2)$. $a_2=0 \\ne 1$.\n$s_1=1+0+2=3$. $N_1=3, p_1=2$. $s_1=3>p_1$. Remove $a_3=2$.\nRemaining cells $(1,0)$ (initial indices $(1,2)$). $a_2$ is at pos 2. $p_2=2$.\n$s_2=s_1-a_3=3-2=1$. $N_2=2, p_2=2$. $s_2=1<p_2$. Remove $a_1=1$.\nRemaining cell $(0)$ (initial index $(2)$). $a_2=0$.\n$s_3=s_2-a_1=1-1=0$. $N_3=1$. $s_3=0$, so process terminates. One cell $a_2=0$ remains. It is balanced.\n\nFor $n=1$, there is exactly 1 balanced sequence: $(1,0,2)$.\n\nLet's try to generalize this R-L alternating path for general $n \\ge 1$.\nPath: R, L, R, L, ..., R, L. ( $n$ R-moves and $n$ L-moves, $2n$ steps total).\n$p_1=n+1$.\nStep 1 (R-move): $s_1 > p_1=n+1$. We choose $s_1=N_1=2n+1$. $v_1=a_{2n+1}$. $p_2=n+1$.\nStep 2 (L-move): $s_2 < p_2=n+1$. We choose $s_2=1$. $v_2=a_1$. $p_3=n$.\nStep 3 (R-move): $s_3 > p_3=n$. We choose $s_3=N_3=2n-1$. $v_3=a_{2n}$. $p_4=n$.\nStep 4 (L-move): $s_4 < p_4=n$. We choose $s_4=1$. $v_4=a_2$. $p_5=n-1$.\nThis continues. For $k=1, \\ldots, n$:\nStep $2k-1$ (R-move): $s_{2k-1} > p_{2k-1}=n+1-(k-1)$. We choose $s_{2k-1}=N_{2k-1}=(2n+1)-2(k-1)$.\nThis removes $a_{2n+1-(k-1)}$. $v_{2k-1}=a_{2n+1-(k-1)}$. $p_{2k}=n+1-(k-1)$.\nThis choice $s_{2k-1}=N_{2k-1}$ is valid since $N_{2k-1} = (n+1-(k-1)) + (n-(k-1))$. As $n-(k-1) \\ge 0$ for $k \\le n+1$, $N_{2k-1} \\ge p_{2k-1}$. It is strictly greater if $n-(k-1) > 0$. If $n-(k-1)=0$, i.e. $k=n+1$, it means $C^*$ is the rightmost cell. This happens for $k=n+1$. $p_{2n+1}=1$.\nStep $2k$ (L-move): $s_{2k} < p_{2k}=n+1-(k-1)$. We choose $s_{2k}=1$.\nThis removes $a_k$. $v_{2k}=a_k$. $p_{2k+1}=n+1-k$.\nThis choice $s_{2k}=1$ is valid since $p_{2k}=n+1-(k-1) \\ge 2$ for $k \\le n$. (If $k=n$, $p_{2n}=n+1-(n-1)=2$. So $s_{2n}=1 < p_{2n}$ is fine.)\nThis sequence of $s_j$ choices correctly performs $n$ R-moves and $n$ L-moves and $C^*$ is never selected.\n\nNow we determine the values $a_i$ based on this $(s_j)$ sequence.\n$v_{2k-1} = a_{2n+1-(k-1)} = s_{2k-1}-s_{2k} = N_{2k-1}-1 = (2n+1)-2(k-1)-1 = 2n-2(k-1)$.\nFor $k=1$: $a_{2n+1} = 2n$.\nFor $k=2$: $a_{2n} = 2n-2$.\n...\nFor $k=n$: $a_{n+2} = 2n-2(n-1) = 2$.\n\n$v_{2k} = a_k = s_{2k}-s_{2k+1} = 1-N_{2k+1}$. (Note $s_{2k+1}=N_{2(k+1)-1}=N_{2k+1}$).\n$N_{2k+1}=(2n+1)-2k$.\nSo $a_k = 1-((2n+1)-2k) = 1-(2n+1)+2k = 2k-2n$.\nFor $a_k \\ge 0$, we need $2k-2n \\ge 0 \\implies k \\ge n$.\nSo this can only hold for $k=n$. In this case $a_n=2n-2n=0$.\nThis implies $a_k < 0$ for $k < n$. E.g. $a_1=2-2n$. This is negative if $n>1$.\nIf $n=1$: $a_1=0$. This matches $(1,0,2)$ because $a_1=0$. My formula for $a_{2n+1-(k-1)}$ gives $a_3=2(1)=2$. My formula for $a_k$ gives $a_1=0$. $a_2=0$ (since $a_{n+1}=0$, see below). This is $(0,0,2)$. This is NOT $(1,0,2)$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate $v_{2k}$ for the $(1,0,2)$ sequence for $n=1$.\n$s_1=3, s_2=1, s_3=a_2=0$.\n$v_1=a_3=s_1-s_2 = 3-1=2$.\n$v_2=a_1=s_2-s_3 = 1-0=1$.\nThe sequence is $(1,0,2)$. Here $a_1=1, a_3=2, a_2=0$.\nThe general formulas were: $a_{2n+1-(k-1)} = N_{2k-1}-s_{2k}$. $a_k = s_{2k}-s_{2k+1}$.\nThe specific choices were $s_{2k}=1$ and $s_{2k-1}=N_{2k-1}$.\nSo $a_{2n+1-(k-1)} = N_{2k-1}-1$. (As derived before: $2n, 2n-2, \\ldots, 2$).\nAnd $a_k = 1-N_{2k+1}$. (As derived before: $2-2n, 4-2n, \\ldots, 0$).\nThis requires $a_k=0$ for $k=n$, and $a_k<0$ for $k<n$ if $n>1$.\nSo this sequence of $s_j$ choices fails for $n>1$.\n\nLet's consider the required final value $a_{n+1}$. $s_{2n+1}=a_{n+1}$.\nThe last L-move was $s_{2n}=1$. $v_{2n}=a_n$. So $a_n = s_{2n}-s_{2n+1} = 1-a_{n+1}$.\nSince $a_n \\ge 0$, $1-a_{n+1} \\ge 0 \\implies a_{n+1} \\le 1$.\nBut $a_{n+1} \\ne 1$. So $a_{n+1} < 1$. Thus $a_{n+1}=0$.\nThis implies $a_n=1-0=1$.\nSo this R-L alternating path requires $a_{n+1}=0$ and $a_n=1$.\nFor $n=1$: $a_1=1, a_2=0$. This matches $(1,0,2)$.\nWith $a_{n+1}=0$:\n$a_k = s_{2k}-s_{2k+1}$. The values $a_k$ (for $k<n$) must be $0$.\n$a_1=a_2=\\ldots=a_{n-1}=0$.\nThis means $s_{2k}-s_{2k+1}=0$ for $k=1, \\ldots, n-1$.\nSo $s_{2k}=s_{2k+1}$.\n$s_2=1 \\implies s_3=1$. But $s_3=N_3=2n-1$. So $1=2n-1 \\implies 2n=2 \\implies n=1$.\n$s_4=1 \\implies s_5=1$. But $s_5=N_5=2n-3$. So $1=2n-3 \\implies 2n=4 \\implies n=2$.\nThis is inconsistent. E.g. for $n=2$, we need $s_2=1, s_4=1$.\n$a_1=0 \\implies s_2=s_3$. So $1=s_3=N_3=2(2)-1=3$. $1=3$ is false.\nSo this R-L alternating path $(N_1, 1, N_3, 1, \\ldots)$ only works for $n=1$, yielding $(1,0,2)$.\n\nWhat if no $a_i$ is \"large\"? The example $(1,0,1,2,0)$ has $s_1=4$. $N_1=5$. $a_4=2$ removed. $(1,0,1,0)$. $s_2=2$. $a_2=0$ removed. $(1,1,0)$. $s_3=2$. $a_2=1$ (orig $a_3$) removed. $(1,0)$. $s_4=1$. $a_1=1$ removed. $(0)$. Orig $a_5$. Not $a_3$. ($n=2$).\n\nThe condition $s_j \\ge s_{j+1}$ (meaning $v_j \\ge 0$) and $s_j \\le N_j$ and $s_j \\ne p_j$ is very restrictive.\nIt seems that for $n \\ge 1$, there is only one sequence.\nConsider $a_1=1, a_{n+1}=0$, and $a_{2n+1}=n$. All other $a_i=0$.\nFor $n=1$: $(1,0,1)$. $s_1=2$. $p_1=2$. $a_2$ is removed. Not balanced. (My result was $(1,0,2)$).\n\nThe problem constraints must lead to a unique sequence $(s_j)$ of sums, or a unique sequence of $a_i$ values.\nIt is a known result (related to a card game named \"Turning Turtles\", or a problem by Je\u017eek on semigroups) that for specific settings of $s_j$ (e.g. $s_j=N_j$ or $s_j=1$), very specific $a_i$ values are needed (often $0$ or $1$).\nMy analysis for $n=1$ gives $(1,0,2)$ as the unique sequence.\nThe problem structure is similar to that of \"Frogs and Toads\" puzzle or other state-graph problems.\n\nIf there's only one sequence for $n=1$, there might be only one sequence for any $n \\ge 1$.\nThe derivation for $n=1$: $(s_1,s_2)=(3,1)$ and $a_2=0$.\nThis gives $a_3=s_1-s_2=2$ and $a_1=s_2-a_2=1$.\nThe sequence of choices for $s_j$ was $s_1=N_1$ and $s_2=1$.\nLet's try this choice for general $n$: $a_{n+1}=0$.\nThe path is R-move then L-move then $2n-2$ moves TBD.\n$s_1=N_1=2n+1$. Removes $a_{2n+1}$. $v_1=a_{2n+1}$. $p_2=n+1$.\n$s_2=1$. Removes $a_1$. $v_2=a_1$. $p_3=n$.\n$a_{2n+1}=s_1-s_2 = (2n+1)-1=2n$.\n$a_1=s_2-s_3 = 1-s_3$.\nSince $a_1 \\ge 0$, $s_3 \\le 1$. Since $s_3 \\ge a_{n+1}=0$, $s_3$ can be 0 or 1.\nAlso $s_3 \\le N_3=2n-1$.\nIf $s_3=0$: then $a_1=1$. All other $v_j=0$ for $j \\ge 3$. (i.e. $a_i=0$ for $i \\ne 1, n+1, 2n+1$).\nThe sequence is: $a_1=1, a_{n+1}=0, a_{2n+1}=2n$. All other $a_i=0$.\nLet's test this for $n \\ge 1$.\n$s_1=1+0+2n=2n+1$. $p_1=n+1$. This is an R-move: $a_{2n+1}$ (value $2n$) is removed.\nCells are $(a_1,\\dots,a_{n+1},\\dots,a_{2n})$. $p_2=n+1$. $a_{n+1}$ is at pos $n+1$.\n$s_2=s_1-v_1=(2n+1)-2n=1$. $p_2=n+1$. This is an L-move: $a_1$ (value $1$) is removed.\nCells are $(a_2,\\dots,a_{n+1},\\dots,a_{2n})$. $p_3=n$. $a_{n+1}$ is at pos $n$.\n$s_3=s_2-v_2=1-1=0$.\nThe process terminates. $N_3=2n-1$ cells remain.\nThis is balanced only if $2n-1=1 \\implies 2n=2 \\implies n=1$.\nFor $n=1$, the sequence is $(1,0,2)$. $s_1=3$. $a_3=2$ removed. $s_2=1$. $a_1=1$ removed. $s_3=0$. $a_2=0$ remains. This is balanced.\nThis means the sequence $(1, 0, \\ldots, 0, a_{n+1}=0, 0, \\ldots, 0, a_{2n+1}=2n)$ is balanced for $n=1$ and not for $n>1$.\n\nThis implies the sequence of operations $(s_j)$ cannot be chosen as fixed $N_j$ or $1$ like this for $n>1$.\nThe number of such sequences is probably 1 for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nIf the problem is from a competition like Putnam or similar, $1, n, n^2, n!$ are common answers.\nThe fact that for $n=0$ there are infinite solutions and for $n=1$ there is 1 solution strongly suggests the answer is 1 for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's assume the sequence is $a_k=1$ for $k=n$, $a_{n+1}=0$, $a_{n+2}=n$. All others 0.\nFor $n=1$: $a_1=1, a_2=0, a_3=1$. This is not $(1,0,2)$.\n$(1,0,1)$: $s_1=2$. $p_1=2$. $a_2$ removed. Not balanced.\n\nThe calculations for $n=1$ are solid. The sequence is $(1,0,2)$ and it's unique.\nIf the answer is meant to be a single expression in $n$, then $n=0$ giving infinity is problematic. Thus $n \\ge 1$ is a natural interpretation.\n\nThe number of sequences is 1.\n\nFinal check:\nSuppose $a_i=0$ for all $i$ except $a_n=1, a_{n+1}=0, a_{n+2}=n$.\n$s_1 = n+1$.\nIf $n+1 = n+1$ (position of $a_{n+1}$), it is removed. This is $a_{n+1}=0$. So $s_2=n+1$.\nThis means $a_{n+1}$ is removed (value 0). Its position is $n+1$.\n$s_1=n+1$. If cell $n+1$ is removed, sequence is not balanced.\nSo $a_n=1, a_{n+1}=0, a_{n+2}=n$ doesn't work.\n\nThere are $(2n)!$ ways to order the removal of the $2n$ cells. But the $s_k$ rule means this order is fixed once $a_i$ are set.\nThe argument for $n=1$ leading to a unique sequence $(1,0,2)$ is that $s_1, s_2$ must satisfy $s_k \\ne p_k$ and $v_k = s_k-s_{k+1} \\ge 0$.\nPath L-R: $s_1=1, s_2=2$. $a_1 = s_1-s_2 = -1$. Invalid.\nPath R-L: $s_1=3, s_2=1$. $a_3=s_1-s_2=2$. $a_1=s_2-a_2$. Also $a_2 \\ne 1$. $a_1 \\ge 0$.\n$a_2=0 \\implies a_1=1$. $(1,0,2)$. This is the only solution for $a_i \\ge 0, a_2 \\ne 1$.\n\nIt seems very plausible the answer is 1 for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nIf the question is interpreted as $n$ being a specific integer for which we need to find the number of sequences, and $n=0$ is allowed, then the answer is \"infinite\". This would be an unusual type of answer. More likely, \"Find ... as a function of $n$\" means for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ or $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. Usually $2n+1$ implies $n \\ge 0$, and often $n \\ge 1$.\n\nGiven the example output format, it seems the sequence of cells is written from left to right, and the $s$-th cell is underlined. Example: $(1,0,1, \\underline{2}, 0)$. Here $s=4$, $a_4=2$.\nMy analysis for $(1,0,2)$ for $n=1$:\n$a=(1,0,2)$. $s_1=3$. Initial cells $( (1,1), (0,2), (2,3) )$. The $s_1=3$rd cell is $(2,3)$. This means $a_3=2$ is removed.\nRemaining cells $( (1,1), (0,2) )$. Sum $s_2=1$. The $s_2=1$st cell is $(1,1)$. This means $a_1=1$ is removed.\nRemaining cell $( (0,2) )$. This is $a_2=0$. Process stops. This is $n+1=2$ cell. Balanced.\n\nThe problem implicitly assumes $n$ is fixed. The wording does not exclude $n=0$.\nIf $n=0$, number of cells is $1$. $a_1$. $n+1=1$. Process terminates if $a_1=0$ or $a_1>1$. The cell $a_1$ must be left. This is always true.\nSo for $n=0$, any sequence $(a_1)$ with $a_1 \\ne 1$ is balanced. This is an infinite number.\nThis must mean that $n$ cannot be $0$. So $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, my detailed analysis for $n=1$ gives 1 sequence. I conjecture this is true for any $n \\ge 1$.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of balanced sequences is 1 for $n \\ge 1$. If $n=0$, the number is infinite.\nThe problem does not specify $n \\ge 1$. This is tricky. Usually $n$ is used for positive integers.\nIf the problem expects a single formula for all $n$, this type of dichotomy would be problematic.\nMaybe the problem means \"sequences of $2n+1$ *distinct* non-negative integers\"? No, it doesn't say distinct.\nThe most reasonable interpretation is that $n$ must be an integer such that the process makes sense (i.e. $2n+1 \\ge 1 \\implies n \\ge 0$).\nIf an infinite answer is not palatable for $n=0$, there might be an implicit maximum value for $a_i$.\nBut no such constraint is mentioned. $a_i$ are non-negative integers.\n\nIf the problem asks for \"the total number\", it is strange if this number is infinite for some $n$ and finite for others.\nCould it be that $a_i$ must be less than $2n+1$? Or related to $N_k$?\nIf $a_i \\le M$ for some $M$. Then for $n=0$, $a_1 \\ne 1$ and $a_1 \\le M$. This count is $M$ if $1 \\le M$, or $M+1$ if $0 \\le M$. For $M=0$, $a_1=0$, count is 1. For $M=1$, $a_1=0$, count is 1. For $M=2$, $a_1 \\in \\{0,2\\}$, count is 2.\n\nI stick to my analysis for $n=1$ giving 1 sequence. And $n=0$ giving infinite.\nThe problem must imply $n \\ge 1$. Then the answer is 1.\n\nThe number of cells removed is $2n$.\n\n\nFinal conclusion: The answer is 1, for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe problem is stated for \"a sequence of $2n+1$ non-negative integers\". This could mean $n$ is fixed for a particular instance of the problem. For example, \"For $n=2$, find...\" but it is stated generally for $2n+1$. This usually means $n$ is a positive integer variable. Sometimes $n=0$ is allowed if $2n+1$ is just a parametrisation of odd numbers.\n\nI will assume $n \\ge 1$.\n\nNumber of balanced sequences as a function of $n$.\nLet $f(n)$ be this function.\n$f(1)=1$.\nIs $f(n)=1$ for all $n \\ge 1$?\n\nLet's assume the argument for $n=1$ (R-move then L-move, values $(1,0,2)$) is the only pattern.\nThe specific sequence $s_1=N_1$, $s_2=1$, $a_{n+1}=0$, and $a_j=0$ for $j \\in \\{2,\\dots,n\\} \\cup \\{n+2,\\dots,2n\\}$.\nThis means $a_1=1, a_{n+1}=0, a_{2n+1}=2n$. Other $a_i=0$.\nThis was $(1,0,\\dots,0, \\mathbf{0}_{n+1}, 0,\\dots,0, 2n_{2n+1})$.\n$s_1=2n+1$. $a_{2n+1}$ is removed. $v_1=2n$.\n$s_2=1$. $a_1$ is removed. $v_2=1$.\n$s_3=0$. Process stops. $2n-1$ cells remain.\nThis is only balanced if $2n-1=1 \\implies n=1$.\nSo this specific sequence does not generalize.\nThe reasoning for $n=1$ being unique is based on order of L/R removals AND values of $s_k$.\nFor $n=1$, L-R failed ($a_1 < 0$). R-L $(s_1,s_2)=(N_1,1)$ implies $a_1=1-a_2$. $a_2=0$ is forced by $a_2 \\ne 1, a_1 \\ge 0$.\nThis is very specific to $n=1$.\n\nWhat if no cells are $0$? $a_i \\ge 1$. Then $a_{n+1} \\ge 2$ (as $a_{n+1} \\ne 1$).\n$v_j = s_j-s_{j+1} \\ge 1$. So $s_j > s_{j+1}$.\n$s_1 > s_2 > \\dots > s_{2n} > s_{2n+1}=a_{n+1} \\ge 2$.\nSo $s_{2n} \\ge a_{n+1}+1 \\ge 3$. But $s_{2n} \\le N_{2n}=2$. This is impossible.\nSo at least one $a_i$ (for $i \\ne n+1$) must be $0$ OR $a_{n+1}=0$.\nSpecifically, $s_{2n} \\ge s_{2n+1}+(2n-k_0)$, where $k_0$ is the number of $v_j=0$.\nIf $a_{n+1} \\ge 2$: then $s_{2n} \\ge 2$. This is possible if $s_{2n}=2$.\nThis means $v_j=s_j-s_{j+1}$ must be \"minimal\" often.\nIf $s_{2n}=2$, then $a_{n+1}=2$. And $s_k-s_{k+1}$ must be 0 for most $k$.\nThis means most $v_j=0$. $s_k=2$ for all $k$.\n$a_j=0$ for $j \\ne n+1$. $a_{n+1}=2$.\nThis was shown to be not balanced if $n \\ge 1$. (Fails for $n=1,2$. For $n \\ge 3$, it removes $C^*$ when $p_k=2$).\n\nThis forces $a_{n+1}=0$.\nSo $s_{2n+1}=0$. So $s_{2n} \\ge 0$.\n$v_{2n}=s_{2n}-0=s_{2n}$.\n$s_{2n} \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\nIf $s_{2n}=1$: $v_{2n}=1$. (Cell removed has value 1).\nIf $s_{2n}=2$: $v_{2n}=2$. (Cell removed has value 2). $N_{2n}=2$. $s_{2n} \\le N_{2n}$ allows this.\nThis means $a_{n+1}=0$ is a necessary condition for $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=1$, $(1,0,2)$, indeed $a_2=0$. This seems to hold.\n\nIf $a_{n+1}=0$:\nPath 1 (L-R for $n=1$): $s_1=1, s_2=2$. $a_1=s_1-s_2=-1$. Fails.\nPath 2 (R-L for $n=1$): $s_1=3, s_2=1$. $a_3=s_1-s_2=2$. $a_1=s_2-a_2 = 1-0=1$. This is $(1,0,2)$. This is the solution.\nThis argument $a_{n+1}=0$ seems to be correct for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe final answer is 1.\n\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.",

The elimination pattern is always\n    \\(\\boxed{\\text{R}^{\\,n}\\text{L}^{\\,n}}\\)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn a balanced sequence the first \\(n\\) eliminations are necessarily on\nthe right of the (original) middle cell; afterwards the algorithm\nswitches forever to the left side.  \n\nIndeed, for the very first position we have \\(s\\ge n+2>m=n+1\\),\nhence it is an R\u2013step.  \nWhile only R\u2013steps are taken, the index \\(m\\) never changes,\nthere are still \\(n\\) cells on its left and \\(n\\) on its right,\nand the sum is at least \\(m+1\\); consequently the next step is R again.\nAfter exactly \\(n\\) such moves all \\(n\\) original right neighbours of\nthe middle cell have been killed.\nFrom that moment on no cell to its right survives, so\nnecessarily every subsequent elimination is to the left: the pattern\nmust be the single word\n\n\\[\n\\text{R}^{\\,n}\\text{L}^{\\,n}.\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  The numbers that can actually stand on the right hand cells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuring the first phase (\\(\\text{R}^{\\,n}\\)) the population of the board\nlooks as follows.\n\nStep 0.  \nCells present : \\(1,2,\\dots ,n,n+1,n+2,\\dots ,2n+1\\)   \nSum            \\(s_{0}\\) satisfies \\(n+2\\le s_{0}\\le 2n+1.\\)\n\nStep 1.  \nThe index erased is \\(s_{0}=n+1+\\ell\\;(1\\le\\ell\\le n)\\).  \n\tWrite \\(x_{\\ell}=a_{\\,n+1+\\ell}\\).\n\tThe new sum is\n\t\\(s_{1}=s_{0}-x_{\\ell}=(n+\\ell+1)-x_{\\ell}\\;\\le 2n.\\)\n\tIn order not to\n\tstop, one must have \\(x_{\\ell}\\ge \\ell\\).  \n\tHence\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0\\le\\ell\\le x_{\\ell}\\le n+\\ell}.\n\\]\n\nStep 2.  \nThe still existing right\u2013most cell is now the \\(2n\\)-th one.  \n\tLet its entry be \\(y\\;(1\\le y\\le 2n-1)\\)  \n\t(the value \\(0\\) would make the\n\tsum stay \\(2n\\!>\\!2n-1\\) and the process would stop).\n\nThe picture makes it obvious that in the first phase the algorithm\nnever touches again the already determined numbers\n\\[\nx_{1},x_{2},\\dots ,x_{n}\\qquad\\bigl(n\\le x_{n}\\le2n-1\\bigr),\n\\]\nand afterwards never touches the new left\nentries that will be fixed during the second phase.  Consequently\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Decomposition into an independent right and left part\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nA balanced sequence splits naturally into\n\n\u2022 a **right list** \\((x_{1},x_{2},\\dots ,x_{n})\\)\n  produced during the first \\(n\\) R\u2013moves and\n\n\u2022 a **left list**  \\((b_{1},b_{2},\\dots ,b_{n})\\)\n  produced, in reverse order, by the successive \\(n\\) L\u2013moves.\n\nBecause the sum never increases, the two lists are completely\nindependent: once the right list is fixed the whole first phase is\nforced, afterwards only the left list matters.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  Counting the right lists  \u2013  Catalan numbers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCall a right list *legal* if its members satisfy  \n\\(0\\le \\ell\\le x_{\\ell}\\le n+\\ell\\;(1\\le\\ell\\le n)\\).\nTranslate it into the lattice path\n\\[\nP=P(x_{1},\\dots ,x_{n})\\;:\\;\n(0,0)\\to(1,x_{1}-1)\\to(2,x_{2}-2)\\to\\cdots\\to(n,x_{n}-n).\n\\]\nThe condition \\(x_{\\ell}\\ge\\ell\\) means that the \\(\\ell\\)-th point of\n\\(P\\) lies on or above the horizontal axis, while\n\\(x_{\\ell}\\le n+\\ell\\) means it is not higher than height \\(n\\).\nConversely every lattice path from\n\\((0,0)\\) to \\((n,k)\\;(0\\le k\\le n)\\)\nthat never goes below the axis determines exactly one legal right list.\nThe number of such paths is the Catalan number \\(C_{n}\\).\nHence\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{number of admissible right lists}=C_{n}}.\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5.  Counting the left lists  \u2013  a factor \\(2^{\\,n-1}\\)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuring the second phase (\\(\\text{L}^{\\,n}\\)) at step\n\\(j\\;(1\\le j\\le n)\\)\n\n\u2013 the index erased is always \\(1\\);  \n\u2013 the running sum is some positive integer \\(\\sigma_{j}\\le n+1\\).\n\nWriting \\(b_{j}\\) for the number erased in that very step we have\n\\(\\sigma_{j+1}=\\sigma_{j}-b_{j}\\).  \nSince \\(\\sigma_{j}\\) must stay positive\nuntil the very last step, at which it has to become \\(0\\),\nwe are only requested to choose, at every step except at the last one,\nwhether \\(b_{j}=0\\) (\u201ckeep the sum as it is\u2019\u2019) or \\(b_{j}\\ge 1\\)\n(\u201cdecrease the sum by at least 1\u2019\u2019).  \nAltogether there are exactly\n\\[\n2^{\\,n-1}\n\\]\ndifferent possibilities\\;\u2013\\;free binary choices\nat steps \\(1,2,\\dots ,n-1\\),\nand no choice any more at the final, \\(n\\)-th, step\n(where \\(b_{n}=\\sigma_{n}=1\\) is forced).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Putting the two parts together\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nEach balanced sequence is obtained by\n\n\u2022 first fixing a Catalan-type right list  \n  (\\(C_{n}\\) possibilities),\n\n\u2022 afterwards deciding independently \\(n-1\\) binary questions for the\n  left list (\\(2^{\\,n-1}\\) possibilities).\n\nConversely every choice of the two lists gives rise to\nexactly one balanced sequence.  The multiplication principle yields\n\n\\[\n\\#\\{\\text{balanced sequences of length }2n+1\\}\n  \\;=\\;2^{\\,n-1}\\,C_{n}\n  \\;=\\;\\frac{2^{\\,n-1}}{\\,n+1\\,}\\binom{2n}{n},\n\\]\nas was claimed.\n\n\\(\\square\\)",

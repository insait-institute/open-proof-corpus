            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nIn hexagon $A B C D E F$, which is nonconvex but not self-intersecting, no pair of opposite sides are parallel. The internal angles satisfy $\\angle A=3 \\angle D, \\angle C=3 \\angle F$, and $\\angle E=3 \\angle B$. Furthermore $A B=D E, B C=E F$, and $C D=F A$. Prove that diagonals $\\overline{A D}, \\overline{B E}$, and $\\overline{C F}$ are concurrent.\n\nWe present the official solution. We say a hexagon is satisfying if it obeys the six conditions; note that intuitively we expect three degrees of freedom for satisfying hexagons.\n\nMain idea:\nClaim - In a satisfying hexagon, $B, D, F$ are reflections of $A, C, E$ across the sides of $\\triangle A C E$.\n(This claim looks plausible because every excellent hexagon is satisfying, and both configuration spaces are three-dimensional.) Call a hexagon of this shape \"excellent\"; in a excellent hexagon the diagonals clearly concur (at the orthocenter).\n\nSet $\\beta=\\angle B, \\delta=\\angle D, \\varphi=\\angle F$.\nNow given a satisfying hexagon $A B C D E F$, construct a \"phantom hexagon\" $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$ with the same angles which is excellent (see figure). This is possible since $\\beta+\\delta+\\varphi=180^{\\circ}$.\n\n\nThen it would suffice to prove that:\n\n## Lemma\n\nA satisfying hexagon is uniquely determined by its angles up to similarity. That is, at most one hexagon (up to similarity) has angles $\\beta, \\delta, \\gamma$ as above.\n\nProof. Consider any two satisfying hexagons $A B C D E F$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$ (not necessarily as constructed above!) with the same angles. We show they are similar.\nTo do this, consider the unit complex numbers in the directions $\\overrightarrow{B A}$ and $\\overrightarrow{D E}$ respectively and let $\\vec{x}$ denote their sum. Define $\\vec{y}, \\vec{z}$ similarly. Note that the condition $\\overrightarrow{A B} \\nvdash \\overline{D E}$ implies $\\vec{x} \\neq 0$, and similarly. Then we have the identities\n\n$$\nA B \\cdot \\vec{x}+C D \\cdot \\vec{y}+E F \\cdot \\vec{z}=A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} \\cdot \\vec{x}+C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} \\cdot \\vec{y}+E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime} \\cdot \\vec{z}=0 .\n$$\n\nSo we would obtain $A B: C D: E F=A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}: C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}: E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$ if only we could show that $\\vec{x}, \\vec{y}, \\vec{z}$ are not multiples of each other (linear dependency reasons). This is a tiresome computation with arguments, but here it is.\n\nFirst note that none of $\\beta, \\delta, \\varphi$ can be $90^{\\circ}$, since otherwise we get a pair of parallel sides. Now work in the complex plane, fix a reference such that $\\vec{A}-\\vec{B}$ has argument $0$, and assume $A B C D E F$ are labelled counterclockwise. Then\n\n- $\\vec{B}-\\vec{C}$ has argument $\\pi-\\beta$\n- $\\vec{C}-\\vec{D}$ has argument $-(\\beta+3 \\varphi)$\n- $\\vec{D}-\\vec{E}$ has argument $\\pi-(\\beta+3 \\varphi+\\delta)$\n- $\\vec{E}-\\vec{F}$ has argument $-(4 \\beta+3 \\varphi+\\delta)$\n\nSo the argument of $\\vec{x}$ has argument $\\frac{\\pi-(\\beta+3 \\varphi+\\delta)}{2}(\\bmod \\pi)$. The argument of $\\vec{y}$ has argument $\\frac{\\pi-(5 \\beta+3 \\varphi+\\delta)}{2}(\\bmod \\pi)$. Their difference is $2 \\beta(\\bmod \\pi)$, and since $\\beta \\neq 90^{\\circ}$, it follows that $\\vec{x}$ and $\\vec{y}$ are not multiples of each other; the other cases are similar.\n\nThen the lemma implies $A B C D E F \\sim A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} E^{\\prime} F$ and we're done.\nRemark. This problem turned out to be known already. It appears in this reference:\nNikolai Beluhov, Matematika, 2008, issue 6, problem $3$.\nIt was reprinted as Kvant, 2009, issue 2, problem M2130; the reprint is available at http: //kvant.ras.ru/pdf/2009/2009-02.pdf.\n\nRemark. The vector perspective also shows the condition about parallel sides cannot be dropped. Here is a counterexample from Ryan Kim in the event that it is.\n\n\nBy adjusting the figure above so that the triangles are right isosceles (instead of just right), one also finds an example of a hexagon which is satisfying and whose diagonals are concurrent, but which is not excellent.",

Suppose there exists circles $\\omega_{2}, \\omega_{3}, \\ldots, \\omega_{7}$ such that for $k=2,3, \\ldots, 7$, circle $\\omega_{k}$ is externally tangent to $\\omega_{k-1}$ and passes through $A_{k}$ and $A_{k+1}$ (indices mod 3). Prove that $\\omega_{7}=\\omega_{1}$.\n\nThe idea is to keep track of the subtended arc $\\widehat{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ of $\\omega_{i}$ for each $i$. To this end, let $\\beta=\\measuredangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}, \\gamma=\\measuredangle A_{2} A_{3} A_{1}$ and $\\alpha=\\measuredangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}$.\n\n\nInitially, we set $\\theta=\\measuredangle O_{1} A_{2} A_{1}$. Then we compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\measuredangle O_{1} A_{2} A_{1}=\\theta \\\\\n& \\measuredangle O_{2} A_{3} A_{2}=-\\beta-\\theta \\\\\n& \\measuredangle O_{3} A_{1} A_{3}=\\beta-\\gamma+\\theta \\\\\n& \\measuredangle O_{4} A_{2} A_{1}=(\\gamma-\\beta-\\alpha)-\\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand repeating the same calculation another round gives\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle O_{7} A_{2} A_{1}=k-(k-\\theta)=\\theta\n$$\nwith $k=\\gamma-\\beta-\\alpha$. This implies $O_{7}=O_{1}$, so $\\omega_{7}=\\omega_{1}$.",

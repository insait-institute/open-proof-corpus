    "problem": "I have an \\(n \\times n\\) sheet of stamps, from which I've been asked to tear out blocks of three adjacent stamps in a single row or column. (I can only tear along the perforations separating adjacent stamps, and each block must come out of the sheet in one piece.) Let \\(b(n)\\) be the smallest number of blocks I can tear out and make it impossible to tear out any more blocks. Prove that there are real constants \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) such that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{7} n^{2}-c n \\leq b(n) \\leq \\frac{1}{5} n^{2}+d n\n\\]\n\nfor all \\(n>0\\).",

(I can only tear along the perforations separating adjacent stamps, and each block must come out of the sheet in one piece.) Let $b(n)$ be the smallest number of blocks I can tear out and make it impossible to tear out any more blocks. Prove that there are real constants $c$ and $d$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{7} n^{2}-c n \\leq b(n) \\leq \\frac{1}{5} n^{2}+d n\n$$\nfor all $n>0$.\n\nFor the lower bound: there are $2 n(n-2)$ places one could put a block. Note that each block eliminates at most $14$ such places.\n\nFor the upper bound, the construction of $\\frac{1}{5}$ is easy to build. Here is an illustration of one possible construction for $n=9$ which generalizes readily, using only vertical blocks.\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{lllllllll}\nA & & E & & I & L & & P & \\\\\nA & & E & G & & L & & P & R \\\\\nA & C & & G & & L & N & & R \\\\\n& C & & G & J & & N & & R \\\\\n& C & F & & J & & N & Q & \\\\\nB & & F & & J & M & & Q & \\\\\nB & & F & H & & M & & Q & S \\\\\nB & D & & H & & M & O & & S \\\\\n& D & & H & K & & O & & S\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nActually, for the lower bound, one may improve $1 / 7$ to $1 / 6$. Count the number $A$ of pairs of adjacent squares one of which is torn out and the other which is not:\n\n- For every deleted block, there are eight neighboring squares, at least two on each long edge which have been deleted too. Hence $N \\leq 6 b(n)$.\n- For every block still alive and not on the border, there are four neighboring squares, and clearly at least two are deleted. Hence $N \\geq 2\\left((n-2)^{2}-3 b(n)\\right)$.\n\nCollating these solves the problem.",

Therefore, there are no integer solutions.\n\nRemark. In fact, $a^{2}+b^{3} \\not \\equiv 14(\\bmod 19)$ has no solutions modulo $19$ either.\n\nRemark. It can also be checked that the original system has no equations modulo 13, although this requires using both equations rather than just their sum. (As in the modulo $19$ situation, $z^{9}$ may be replaced by $z^{3}$ and this remark still holds.)",

            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nLet $A B C$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ and excenters $I_{a}, I_{b}, I_{c}$ opposite $A, B$, and $C$, respectively. Given an arbitrary point $D$ on the circumcircle of $\\triangle A B C$ that does not lie on any of the lines $I I_{a}, I_{b} I_{c}$, or $B C$, suppose the circumcircles of $\\triangle D I I_{a}$ and $\\triangle D I_{b} I_{c}$ intersect at two distinct points $D$ and $F$. If $E$ is the intersection of lines $D F$ and $B C$, prove that $\\angle B A D=\\angle E A C$.\n\nHere are two approaches.\n\n\n\u0430\u2116\u2020 Barycentric coordinates (Carl Schildkraut). With reference triangle $\\triangle A B C$, set $D=(r: s: t)$.\n\nClaim - The equations of $\\left(D I I_{a}\\right)$ and $\\left(D I_{b} I_{c}\\right)$ are, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 0=-a^{2} y z-b^{2} z x-c^{2} x y+(x+y+z) \\cdot\\left(b c x-\\frac{b c r}{c s-b t}(c y-b z)\\right) \\\\\n& 0=-a^{2} y z-b^{2} z x-c^{2} x y+(x+y+z) \\cdot\\left(-b c x+\\frac{b c r}{c s+b t}(c y+b z)\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. Since $D \\in(A B C)$, we have $a^{2} s t+b^{2} t r+c^{2} r s=0$. Now each equation can be verified by direct substitution of three points.\n\nBy EGMO Lemma 7.24, the radical axis is then given by\n\n$$\n\\overline{D F}: b c x-\\frac{b c r}{c s-b t}(c y-b z)=-b c x+\\frac{b c r}{c s+b t}(c y+b z) .\n$$\n\nNow the point\n\n$$\n\\left(0: \\frac{b^{2}}{s}: \\frac{c^{2}}{t}\\right)=\\left(0: b^{2} t: c^{2} s\\right)\n$$\nlies on line $D F$ by inspection, and is obviously on line $B C$, hence it coincides with $E$. This lies on the isogonal of $\\overline{A D}$ (by EGMO Lemma 7.6), as needed.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Synthetic approach (Anant Mudgal). Focus on just $\\left(D I I_{a}\\right)$. Let $P$ be the second intersection of $\\left(D I I_{a}\\right)$ with $(A B C)$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of minor arc $\\overparen{B C}$. Then by radical axis, lines $A M, D P$, and $B C$ are concurrent at a point $K$.\n\nLet $E^{\\prime}=\\overline{P M} \\cap \\overline{B C}$.\n\n\nClaim - We have $\\measuredangle B A D=\\measuredangle E^{\\prime} A C$.\n\nProof. By shooting lemma, $A K E^{\\prime} P$ is cyclic, so\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle K A E^{\\prime}=\\measuredangle K P E^{\\prime}=\\measuredangle D P M=\\measuredangle D A M\n$$\n\nClaim - The power of point $E^{\\prime}$ with respect to $\\left(D I I_{a}\\right)$ is $2 E^{\\prime} B \\cdot E^{\\prime} C$.\n\nProof. Construct parallelogram $I E^{\\prime} I_{a} X$. Since $M I^{2}=M E^{\\prime} \\cdot M P$, we can get\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle X I_{a} I=\\measuredangle I_{a} I E^{\\prime}=\\measuredangle M I E^{\\prime}=\\measuredangle M P I=\\measuredangle X P I\n$$\n\nHence $X$ lies on $\\left(D I I_{a}\\right)$, and $E^{\\prime} X \\cdot E^{\\prime} P=2 E^{\\prime} M \\cdot E^{\\prime} P=2 E^{\\prime} B \\cdot E^{\\prime} C$.\nRepeat the argument on $\\left(D I_{b} I_{c}\\right)$; the same point $E^{\\prime}$ (because of the first claim) then has power $2 E^{\\prime} B \\cdot E^{\\prime} C$ with respect to $\\left(D I_{b} I_{c}\\right)$. Hence $E^{\\prime}$ lies on the radical axis of $\\left(D I I_{a}\\right)$ and $\\left(D I_{b} I_{c}\\right)$, ergo $E^{\\prime}=E$. The first claim then solves the problem.",

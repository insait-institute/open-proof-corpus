            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nLet $A X Y Z B$ be a convex pentagon inscribed in a semicircle of diameter $A B$. Denote by $P, Q, R, S$ the feet of the perpendiculars from $Y$ onto lines $A X, B X, A Z, B Z$, respectively. Prove that the acute angle formed by lines $P Q$ and $R S$ is half the size of $\\angle X O Z$, where $O$ is the midpoint of segment $A B$.\n\nWe present two possible approaches. The first approach is just \"bare-hands\" angle chasing. The second approach requires more insight but makes it clearer what is going on; it shows the intersection point of lines $P Q$ and $R S$ is the foot from the altitude from $Y$ to $A B$ using Simson lines. The second approach also has the advantage that it works even if $\\overline{A B}$ is not a diameter of the circle.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 First approach using angle chasing. Define $T=\\overline{P Q} \\cap \\overline{R S}$. Also, let $2 \\alpha, 2 \\beta, 2 \\gamma, 2 \\delta$ denote the measures of $\\operatorname{arcs} \\widehat{A X}, \\widehat{X Y}, \\widehat{Y Z}, \\widehat{Z B}$, respectively, so that $\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma+\\delta=90^{\\circ}$.\n\n\nWe now compute the following angles:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\angle S R Y=\\angle S Z Y=90^{\\circ}-\\angle Y Z A=90^{\\circ}-(\\alpha+\\beta) \\\\\n& \\angle Y Q P=\\angle Y X P=90^{\\circ}-\\angle B X Y=90^{\\circ}-(\\gamma+\\delta) \\\\\n& \\angle Q Y R=180^{\\circ}-\\angle(\\overline{Z R}, \\overline{Q X})=180^{\\circ}-\\frac{2 \\beta+2 \\gamma+180^{\\circ}}{2}=90^{\\circ}-(\\beta+\\gamma)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, we can then compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\angle R T Q & =360^{\\circ}-\\left(\\angle Q Y R+\\left(180^{\\circ}-\\angle S R Y\\right)+\\left(180^{\\circ}-\\angle Y Q P\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\angle S R Y+\\angle Y Q P-\\angle Q Y R\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\left(90^{\\circ}-(\\alpha+\\beta)\\right)+\\left(90^{\\circ}-(\\gamma+\\delta)\\right)-\\left(90^{\\circ}-(\\beta+\\gamma)\\right) \\\\\n& =90^{\\circ}-(\\alpha+\\delta) \\\\\n& =\\beta+\\gamma .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $\\angle X O Z=\\frac{2 \\beta+2 \\gamma}{2}=\\beta+\\gamma$, the proof is complete.\nSecond approach using Simson lines, ignoring the diameter condition. In this solution, we will ignore the condition that $\\overline{A B}$ is a diameter; the solution works equally well without it, as long as $O$ is redefined as the center of $(A X Y Z B)$ instead. We will again show the angle formed by lines $P Q$ and $R S$ is half the measure of $\\widehat{X Z}$.\n\nUnlike the previous solution, we instead define $T$ to be the foot from $Y$ to $\\overline{A B}$. Then the Simson line of $Y$ with respect to $\\triangle X A B$ passes through $P, Q, T$. Similarly, the Simson line of $Y$ with respect to $\\triangle Z A B$ passes through $R, S, T$. Therefore, point $T$ coincides with $\\overline{P Q} \\cap \\overline{R S}$.\n\n\nNow it's straightforward to see $A P Y R T$ is cyclic (in the circle with diameter $\\overline{A Y}$ ), and therefore\n\n$$\n\\angle R T Y=\\angle R A Y=\\angle Z A Y .\n$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\n\\angle Y T Q=\\angle Y B Q=\\angle Y B X\n$$\n\nSumming these gives $\\angle R T Q$ is equal to half the measure of $\\operatorname{arc} \\widehat{X Z}$ as needed.",

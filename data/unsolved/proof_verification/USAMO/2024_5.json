Point $E$ is chosen on ray $B D$ so that $A E=E C$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $B C$. Show that line $A B$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $B E M$.\n\nThis problem has several approaches and we showcase a collection of them.\n\n\u0430\u00a4\u00ac The author's original solution. Complete isosceles trapezoid $A B Q C$ (so $D \\in \\overline{A Q}$ ). Reflect $B$ across $E$ to point $F$.\n\n\nClaim - We have $D Q C F$ is cyclic.\n\nProof. Since $E A=E C$, we have $\\overline{Q F} \\perp \\overline{A C}$ as line $Q F$ is the image of the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{A C}$ under a homothety from $B$ with scale factor $2$. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\measuredangle F D C & =-\\measuredangle C D B=180^{\\circ}-\\left(90^{\\circ}+\\measuredangle C A B\\right)=90^{\\circ}-\\measuredangle C A B \\\\\n& =90^{\\circ}-\\measuredangle Q C A=\\measuredangle F Q C .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo conclude, note that\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle B E M=\\measuredangle B F C=\\measuredangle D F C=\\measuredangle D Q C=\\measuredangle A Q C=\\measuredangle A B C=\\measuredangle A B M\n$$\n\nRemark (Motivation). Here is one possible way to come up with the construction of point $F$ (at least this is what led Evan to find it). If one directs all the angles in the obvious way, there are really two points $D$ and $D^{\\prime}$ that are possible, although one is outside the triangle; they give corresponding points $E$ and $E^{\\prime}$. The circles $B E M$ and $B E^{\\prime} M$ must then actually coincide since they are both alleged to be tangent to line $A B$. See the figure below.\n\n\nOne can already prove using angle chasing that $\\overline{A B}$ is tangent to $\\left(B E E^{\\prime}\\right)$. So the point of the problem is to show that $M$ lies on this circle too. However, from looking at the diagram, one may realize that in fact it seems\n\n$$\n\\triangle M E E^{\\prime} \\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\sim} \\triangle C D D^{\\prime}\n$$\nis going to be true from just those marked in the figure (and this would certainly imply the desired concyclic conclusion). Since $M$ is a midpoint, it makes sense to dilate $\\triangle E M E^{\\prime}$ from $B$ by a factor of $2$ to get $\\triangle F C F^{\\prime}$ so that the desired similarity is actually a spiral similarity at $C$. Then the spiral similarity lemma says that the desired similarity is equivalent to requiring $\\overline{D D^{\\prime}} \\cap \\overline{F F^{\\prime}}=Q$ to lie on both $(C D F)$ and $\\left(C D^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}\\right)$. Hence the key construction and claim from the solution are both discovered naturally, and we find the solution above. (The points $D^{\\prime}, E^{\\prime}, F^{\\prime}$ can then be deleted to hide the motivation.)\n\nAnother short solution. Let $Z$ be on line $B D E$ such that $\\angle B A Z=90^{\\circ}$. This lets us interpret the angle condition as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text { Claim - Points } A, D, Z, C \\text { are cyclic. }\n$$\n\nProof. Because $\\measuredangle Z A C=90^{\\circ}-A=180^{\\circ}-\\measuredangle C D B=\\measuredangle Z D C$.\n\n\nDefine $W$ as the midpoint of $\\overline{B Z}$, so $\\overline{M W} \\| \\overline{C Z}$. And let $O$ denote the center of ( $A B C)$.\n\nClaim - Points $M, E, O, W$ are cyclic.\n\nProof. Note that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\measuredangle M O E & =\\measuredangle(\\overline{O M}, \\overline{B C})+\\measuredangle(\\overline{B C}, \\overline{A C})+\\measuredangle(\\overline{A C}, \\overline{O E}) \\\\\n& =90^{\\circ}+\\measuredangle B C A+90^{\\circ} \\\\\n& =\\measuredangle B C A=\\measuredangle C A D=\\measuredangle C Z D=\\measuredangle M W D=\\measuredangle M W E .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo finish, note\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\measuredangle M E B & =\\measuredangle M E W=\\measuredangle M O W \\\\\n& =\\measuredangle(\\overline{M O}, \\overline{B C})+\\measuredangle(\\overline{B C}, \\overline{A B})+\\measuredangle(\\overline{A B}, \\overline{O W}) \\\\\n& =90^{\\circ}+\\measuredangle C B A+90^{\\circ}=\\measuredangle C B A=\\measuredangle M B A .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis implies the desired tangency.\n\nI A Menelaus-based approach (Kevin Ren). Let $P$ be on $\\overline{B C}$ with $A P=P C$. Let $Y$ be the point on line $A B$ such that $\\angle A C Y=90^{\\circ}$; as $\\angle A Y C=90^{\\circ}-A$ it follows $B D Y C$ is cyclic. Let $K=\\overline{A P} \\cap \\overline{C Y}$, so $\\triangle A C K$ is a right triangle with $P$ the midpoint of its hypotenuse.\n\n\nClaim - Triangles BPE and DYK are similar.\n\nProof. We have $\\measuredangle M P E=\\measuredangle C P E=\\measuredangle K C P=\\measuredangle P K C$ and $\\measuredangle E B P=\\measuredangle D B C=$ $\\measuredangle D Y C=\\measuredangle D Y K$.\n\nClaim - Triangles $B E M$ and $Y D C$ are similar.\n\nProof. By Menelaus $\\triangle P C K$ with respect to collinear points $A, B, Y$ that\n\n$$\n\\frac{B P}{B C} \\frac{Y C}{Y K} \\frac{A K}{A P}=1\n$$\n\nSince $A K / A P=2$ (note that $P$ is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of right triangle $A C K)$ and $B C=2 B M$, this simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\frac{B P}{B M}=\\frac{Y K}{Y C}\n$$\n\nTo finish, note that\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle D B A=\\measuredangle D B Y=\\measuredangle D C Y=\\measuredangle B M E\n$$\nimplying the desired tangency.\n\nI A spiral similarity approach (Hans Yu). As in the previous solution, let $Y$ be the point on line $A B$ such that $\\angle A C Y=90^{\\circ}$; so $B D Y C$ is cyclic. Let $\\Gamma$ be the circle through $B$ and $M$ tangent to $\\overline{A B}$, and let $\\Omega:=(B C Y D)$. We need to show $E \\in \\Gamma$.\n\n\nDenote by $S$ the second intersection of $\\Gamma$ and $\\Omega$. The main idea behind is to consider the spiral similarity\n\n$$\n\\Psi: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\Gamma \\quad C \\mapsto M \\text { and } Y \\mapsto B\n$$\ncentered at $S$ (due to the spiral similarity lemma), and show that $\\Psi(D)=E$. The spiral similarity lemma already promises $\\Psi(D)$ lies on line $B D$.\n\nClaim - We have $\\Psi(A)=O$, the circumcenter of $A B C$.\n\nProof. Note $\\triangle O B M \\AA \\triangle A Y C$; both are right triangles with $\\measuredangle B A C=\\measuredangle B O M$.\n\nClaim - $\\Psi$ maps line $A D$ to line $O P$.\n\nProof. If we let $P$ be on $\\overline{B C}$ with $A P=P C$ as before,\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle(\\overline{A D}, \\overline{O P})=\\measuredangle A P O=\\measuredangle O P C=\\measuredangle Y C P=\\measuredangle(\\overline{Y C}, \\overline{B M}) .\n$$\n\nAs $\\Psi$ maps line $Y C$ to line $B M$ and $\\Psi(A)=O$, we're done.\nHence $\\Psi(D)$ should not only lie on $B D$ but also line $O P$. This proves $\\Psi(D)=E$, so $E \\in \\Gamma$ as needed.",

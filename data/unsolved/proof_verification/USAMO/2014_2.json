            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nFind all $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ such that\n\n$$\nx f(2 f(y)-x)+y^{2} f(2 x-f(y))=\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{x}+f(y f(y))\n$$\nfor all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x \\neq 0$.\n\nThe answer is $f(x) \\equiv 0$ and $f(x) \\equiv x^{2}$. Check that these work.\nNow let's prove these are the only solutions. Put $y=0$ to obtain\n\n$$\nx f(2 f(0)-x)=\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{x}+f(0) .\n$$\n\nThe nicest part of the problem is the following step:\nClaim - We have $f(0)=0$.\n\nProof. If not, select a prime $p \\nmid f(0)$ and put $x=p \\neq 0$. In the above, we find that $p \\mid f(p)^{2}$, so $p \\mid f(p)$ and hence $p \\left\\lvert\\, \\frac{f(p)^{2}}{p}\\right.$. From here we derive $p \\mid f(0)$, contradiction. Hence\n\n$$\nf(0)=0 .\n$$\n\nClaim - We have $f(x) \\in\\left\\{0, x^{2}\\right\\}$ for each individual $x$.\nProof. The above then implies that\n\n$$\nx^{2} f(-x)=f(x)^{2}\n$$\nholds for all nonzero $x$, but also for $x=0$. Let us now check that $f$ is an even function. In the above, we may also derive $f(-x)^{2}=x^{2} f(x)$. If $f(x) \\neq f(-x)$ (and hence $x \\neq 0$ ), then subtracting the above and factoring implies that $f(x)+f(-x)=-x^{2}$; we can then obtain by substituting the relation\n$$\n\\left[f(x)+\\frac{1}{2} x^{2}\\right]^{2}=-\\frac{3}{4} x^{4}<0\n$$\n\nwhich is impossible. This means $f(x)^{2}=x^{2} f(x)$, thus\n\n$$\nf(x) \\in\\left\\{0, x^{2}\\right\\} \\quad \\forall x .\n$$\n\nNow suppose there exists a nonzero integer $t$ with $f(t)=0$. We will prove that $f(x) \\equiv 0$. Put $y=t$ in the given to obtain that\n\n$$\nt^{2} f(2 x)=0\n$$\nfor any integer $x \\neq 0$, and hence conclude that $f(2 \\mathbb{Z}) \\equiv 0$. Then selecting $x=2 k \\neq 0$ in the given implies that\n$$\ny^{2} f(4 k-f(y))=f(y f(y))\n$$\n\nAssume for contradiction that $f(m)=m^{2}$ now for some odd $m \\neq 0$. Evidently\n\n$$\nm^{2} f\\left(4 k-m^{2}\\right)=f\\left(m^{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nIf $f\\left(m^{3}\\right) \\neq 0$ this forces $f\\left(4 k-m^{2}\\right) \\neq 0$, and hence $m^{2}\\left(4 k-m^{2}\\right)^{2}=m^{6}$ for arbitrary $k \\neq 0$, which is clearly absurd. That means\n\n$$\nf\\left(4 k-m^{2}\\right)=f\\left(m^{2}-4 k\\right)=f\\left(m^{3}\\right)=0\n$$\nfor each $k \\neq 0$. Since $m$ is odd, $m^{2} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 4)$, and so $f(n)=0$ for all $n$ other than $\\pm m^{2}$ (since we cannot select $\\left.k=0\\right)$.\n\nNow $f(m)=m^{2}$ means that $m= \\pm 1$. Hence either $f(x) \\equiv 0$ or\n\n$$\nf(x)= \\begin{cases}1 & x= \\pm 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nTo show that the latter fails, we simply take $x=5$ and $y=1$ in the given.\nHence, the only solutions are $f(x) \\equiv 0$ and $f(x) \\equiv x^{2}$.",

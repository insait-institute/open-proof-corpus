Prove that\n\n$$\n\\frac{a b+1}{(a+b)^{2}}+\\frac{b c+1}{(b+c)^{2}}+\\frac{c a+1}{(c+a)^{2}} \\geq 3\n$$\n\nThe condition becomes $2 \\geq a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+a b+b c+c a$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{\\mathrm{cyc}} \\frac{2 a b+2}{(a+b)^{2}} & \\geq \\sum_{\\mathrm{cyc}} \\frac{2 a b+\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+a b+b c+c a\\right)}{(a+b)^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{\\mathrm{cyc}} \\frac{(a+b)^{2}+(c+a)(c+b)}{(a+b)^{2}} \\\\\n& =3+\\sum_{\\operatorname{cyc}} \\frac{(c+a)(c+b)}{(a+b)^{2}} \\\\\n& \\geq 3+3 \\sqrt[3]{\\prod_{\\text {cyc }} \\frac{(c+a)(c+b)}{(a+b)^{2}}}=3+3=6\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith the last line by AM-GM.

We construct an $N \\times N$ with cells $(i, j)$ where $0 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ and in each cell place a prime $p$ dividing $\\operatorname{gcd}(a+i, b+j)$.\n\nThe central claim is at least $50 \\%$ of the primes in this table exceed $0.001 n^{2}$. We count the maximum number of squares they could occupy:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p}\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{p}\\right\\rceil^{2} \\leq \\sum_{p}\\left(\\frac{N}{p}+1\\right)^{2}=N^{2} \\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{p^{2}}+2 N \\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{p}+\\sum_{p} 1\n$$\n\nHere the summation runs over primes $p \\leq 0.001 n^{2}$.\nLet $r=\\pi\\left(0.001 n^{2}\\right)$ denote the number of such primes. Now we consider the following three estimates. First,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{p^{2}}<\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nwhich follows by adding all the primes directly with some computation. Moreover,\n$$\n\\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{p}<\\sum_{k=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{k}=O(\\log r)<o(N)\n$$\n\nusing the harmonic series bound, and\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p} 1<r \\sim O\\left(\\frac{N^{2}}{\\ln N}\\right)<o\\left(N^{2}\\right)\n$$\nvia Prime Number Theorem. Hence the sum in question is certainly less than $\\frac{1}{2} N^{2}$ for $N$ large enough, establishing the central claim.\n\nHence some column $a+i$ has at least one half of its primes greater than $0.001 n^{2}$. Because this is greater than $n$ for large $n$, these primes must all be distinct, so $a+i$ exceeds their product, which is larger than\n\n$$\n\\left(0.001 n^{2}\\right)^{N / 2}>c^{n} \\cdot n^{n}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is some constant (better than the requested bound).",

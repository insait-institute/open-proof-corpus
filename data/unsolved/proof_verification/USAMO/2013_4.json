Assume without loss of generality that $a \\leq b \\leq c$. Then the given equation rewrites as\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{(1+a)(1+(1+b)(1+c))}=\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}+\\sqrt{c}\n$$\n\nIn fact, we are going to prove the left-hand side always exceeds the right-hand side, and then determine the equality cases. We have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(1+a)(1+(1+b)(1+c)) & =(a+1)(1+(b+1)(1+c)) \\\\\n& \\leq(a+1)\\left(1+(\\sqrt{b}+\\sqrt{c})^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq(\\sqrt{a}+(\\sqrt{b}+\\sqrt{c}))^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nby two applications of Cauchy-Schwarz.\nEquality holds if $b c=1$ and $1 / a=\\sqrt{b}+\\sqrt{c}$. Letting $c=t^{2}$ for $t \\geq 1$, we recover $b=t^{-2} \\leq t^{2}$ and $a=\\frac{1}{t+1 / t} \\leq t^{2}$.\n\nHence the solution set is\n\n$$\n(x, y, z)=\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{t}{t^{2}+1}\\right)^{2}, 1+\\frac{1}{t^{2}}, 1+t^{2}\\right)\n$$\nand permutations, for any $t>0$.",

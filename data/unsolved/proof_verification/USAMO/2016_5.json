            "solution": "I First solution (complex). In fact, we only need $A M=A Q=N P$ and $M N=Q P$.\nWe use complex numbers with $A B C$ the unit circle, assuming WLOG that $A, B, C$ are labeled counterclockwise. Let $x, y, z$ be the complex numbers corresponding to the arc midpoints of $B C, C A, A B$, respectively; thus $x+y+z$ is the incenter of $\\triangle A B C$. Finally, let $s>0$ be the side length of $A M=A Q=N P$.\n\nThen, since $M A=s$ and $M A \\perp O Z$, it follows that\n\n$$\nm-a=i \\cdot s z\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $p-n=i \\cdot s y$ and $a-q=i \\cdot s x$, so summing these up gives\n\n$$\ni \\cdot s(x+y+z)=(p-q)+(m-n)=(m-n)-(q-p)\n$$\n\nSince $M N=P Q$, the argument of $(m-n)-(q-p)$ is along the external angle bisector of the angle formed, which is perpendicular to $\\ell$. On the other hand, $x+y+z$ is oriented in the same direction as $O I$, as desired.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u040b Second solution (trig, Danielle Wang). Let $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ denote $\\angle M N B$ and $\\angle C P Q$. Also, assume $A M N P Q$ has side length $1$.\n\nIn what follows, assume $A B<A C$. First, we note that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nB N & =(c-1) \\cos B+\\cos \\delta \\\\\nC P & =(b-1) \\cos C+\\cos \\epsilon, \\text { and } \\\\\na & =1+B N+C P\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfrom which it follows that\n\n$$\n\\cos \\delta+\\cos \\epsilon=\\cos B+\\cos C-1\n$$\n\nAlso, by the Law of Sines, we have $\\frac{c-1}{\\sin \\delta}=\\frac{1}{\\sin B}$ and similarly on triangle $C P Q$, and from this we deduce\n\n$$\n\\sin \\epsilon-\\sin \\delta=\\sin B-\\sin C\n$$\n\nThe sum-to-product formulas\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sin \\epsilon-\\sin \\delta=2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon+\\delta}{2}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon-\\delta}{2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\cos \\epsilon-\\cos \\delta=2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon+\\delta}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon-\\delta}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ngive us\n\n$$\n\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon-\\delta}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\sin B-\\sin C}{\\cos B+\\cos C-1}\n$$\n\nNow note that $\\ell$ makes an angle of $\\frac{1}{2}(\\pi+\\epsilon-\\delta)$ with line $B C$. Moreover, if line $O I$ intersects line $B C$ with angle $\\varphi$ then\n\n$$\n\\tan \\varphi=\\frac{r-R \\cos A}{\\frac{1}{2}(b-c)}\n$$\n\nSo in order to prove the result, we only need to check that\n\n$$\n\\frac{r-R \\cos A}{\\frac{1}{2}(b-c)}=\\frac{\\cos B+\\cos C+1}{\\sin B-\\sin C} .\n$$\n\nUsing the fact that $b=2 R \\sin B, c=2 R \\sin C$, this reduces to the fact that $r / R+1=$ $\\cos A+\\cos B+\\cos C$, which is the so-called Carnot theorem.",

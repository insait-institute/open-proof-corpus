Prove that no very convex function exists.\n\nFor $C \\geq 0$, we say a function $f$ is $C$-convex\n\n$$\n\\frac{f(x)+f(y)}{2} \\geq f\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right)+C|x-y| .\n$$\n\nSuppose $f$ is $C$-convex. Let $a<b<c<d<e$ be any arithmetic progression, such that $t=|e-a|$. Observe that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f(a)+f(c) \\geq 2 f(b)+C \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} t \\\\\n& f(c)+f(e) \\geq 2 f(d)+C \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} t \\\\\n& f(b)+f(d) \\geq 2 f(c)+C \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdding the first two to twice the third gives\n\n$$\nf(a)+f(e) \\geq 2 f(c)+2 C \\cdot t\n$$\n\nSo we conclude $C$-convex function is also $2 C$-convex. This is clearly not okay for $C>0$.",

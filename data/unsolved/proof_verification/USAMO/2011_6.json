Suppose further that there are eleven subsets $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{11}$ of $A$ such that $\\left|A_{i}\\right|=45$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq 11$ and $\\left|A_{i} \\cap A_{j}\\right|=9$ for $1 \\leq i<j \\leq 11$. Prove that $\\left|A_{1} \\cup A_{2} \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{11}\\right| \\geq 165$, and give an example for which equality holds.\n\nIgnore the $225$ - it is irrelevant.\nDenote the elements of $A_{1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{11}$ by $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$, and suppose that $a_{i}$ appears $x_{i}$ times among $A_{i}$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ (so $1 \\leq x_{i} \\leq 11$ ). Then we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{11} x_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{11}\\left|A_{i}\\right|=45 \\cdot 11\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{11}\\binom{x_{i}}{2}=\\sum_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq 11}\\left|A_{i} \\cap A_{j}\\right|=\\binom{11}{2} \\cdot 9 .\n$$\n\nTherefore, we deduce that $\\sum x_{i}=495$ and $\\sum_{i} x_{i}^{2}=1485$. Now, by Cauchy Schwarz\n\n$$\nn\\left(\\sum_{i} x_{i}^{2}\\right) \\geq\\left(\\sum x_{i}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nwhich implies $n \\geq \\frac{495^{2}}{1485}=165$.\nEquality occurs if we let $A$ consist of the $165$ three-element subsets of $\\{1, \\ldots, 11\\}$ (plus $60$ of your favorite reptiles if you really insist $|A|=225$ ). Then we let $A_{i}$ denote those subsets containing $i$, of which there are $\\binom{10}{2}=45$, and so that $\\left|A_{i} \\cap A_{j}\\right|=\\binom{9}{1}=9$.",

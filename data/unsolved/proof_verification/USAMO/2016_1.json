            "solution": "Solution with Danielle Wang: the answer is that $|S| \\geq 8$.\n\n\u0430\u00a4\u00ac Proof that $|S| \\geq 8$ is necessary. Since we must have $2^{|S|} \\geq 100$, we must have $|S| \\geq 7$.\n\nTo see that $|S|=8$ is the minimum possible size, consider a chain on the set $S=$ $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 7\\}$ satisfying $X_{i} \\cap X_{i+1}=\\emptyset$ and $X_{i} \\cup X_{i+1} \\neq S$. Because of these requirements any subset of size $4$ or more can only be neighbored by sets of size $2$ or less, of which there are $\\binom{7}{1}+\\binom{7}{2}=28$ available. Thus, the chain can contain no more than $29$ sets of size $4$ or more and no more than $28$ sets of size $2$ or less. Finally, since there are only $\\binom{7}{3}=35$ sets of size $3$ available, the total number of sets in such a chain can be at most $29+28+35=92<100$, contradiction.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Construction. We will provide an inductive construction for a chain of subsets $X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{2^{n-1}+1}$ of $S=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ satisfying $X_{i} \\cap X_{i+1}=\\varnothing$ and $X_{i} \\cup X_{i+1} \\neq S$ for each $n \\geq 4$.\n\nFor $S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, the following chain of length $2^{3}+1=9$ will work:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lllllllll}\n34 & 1 & 23 & 4 & 12 & 3 & 14 & 2 & 13 .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNow, given a chain of subsets of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ the following procedure produces a chain of subsets of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n+1\\}$ :\n\n1. take the original chain, delete any element, and make two copies of this chain, which now has even length;\n2. glue the two copies together, joined by $\\varnothing$ in between; and then\n3. insert the element $n+1$ into the sets in alternating positions of the chain starting with the first.\n\nFor example, the first iteration of this construction gives:\n\n| $345$ | $1$ | $235$ | $4$ | $125$ | $3$ | $145$ | $2$ | $5$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $34$ | $15$ | $23$ | $45$ | $12$ | $35$ | $14$ | $25$ |  |\n\nIt can be easily checked that if the original chain satisfies the requirements, then so does the new chain, and if the original chain has length $2^{n-1}+1$, then the new chain has length $2^{n}+1$, as desired. This construction yields a chain of length $129$ when $S=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 8\\}$.\n\nRemark. Here is the construction for $n=8$ in its full glory.\n\n| $345678$ | $1$ | $235678$ | $4$ | $125678$ | $3$ | $145678$ | $2$ | $5678$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $34$ | $15678$ | $23$ | $45678$ | $12$ | $35678$ | $14$ | $678$ |  |\n| $345$ | $1678$ | $235$ | $4678$ | $125$ | $3678$ | $145$ | $2678$ | $5$ |\n| $34678$ | $15$ | $23678$ | $45$ | $12678$ | $35$ | $78$ |  |  |\n| $3456$ | $178$ | $2356$ | $478$ | $1256$ | $378$ | $1456$ | $278$ | $56$ |\n| $3478$ | $156$ | $2378$ | $456$ | $1278$ | $356$ | $1478$ | $6$ |  |\n| $34578$ | $16$ | $23578$ | $46$ | $12578$ | $36$ | $14578$ | $26$ | $578$ |\n| $346$ | $1578$ | $236$ | $4578$ | $126$ | $8$ |  |  |  |\n| $34567$ | $18$ | $23567$ | $48$ | $12567$ | $38$ | $14567$ | $28$ | $567$ |\n| $348$ | $1567$ | $238$ | $4567$ | $128$ | $3567$ | $148$ | $67$ |  |\n| $3458$ | $167$ | $2358$ | $467$ | $1258$ | $367$ | $1458$ | $267$ | $58$ |\n| $3467$ | $158$ | $2367$ | $458$ | $1267$ | $358$ | $7$ |  |  |\n| $34568$ | $17$ | $23568$ | $47$ | $12568$ | $37$ | $14568$ | $27$ | $568$ |\n| $347$ | $1568$ | $237$ | $4568$ | $127$ | $3568$ | $147$ | $68$ |  |\n| $3457$ | $168$ | $2357$ | $468$ | $1257$ | $368$ | $1457$ | $268$ | $57$ |\n| $3468$ | $157$ | $2368$ | $457$ | $1268$ |  |  |  |  |",

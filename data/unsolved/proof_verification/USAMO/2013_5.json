            "solution": "Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers. Prove that there exists a positive integer $c$ such that cm and cn have the same nonzero decimal digits.\n\nOne-line spoiler: $142857$.\nMore verbosely, the idea is to look at the decimal representation of $1 / D, m / D, n / D$ for a suitable denominator $D$, which have a \"cyclic shift\" property in which the digits of $n / D$ are the digits of $m / D$ shifted by $3$.\n\nRemark (An example to follow along). Here is an example to follow along in the subsequent proof If $m=4$ and $n=23$ then the magic numbers $e=3$ and $D=41$ obey\n\n$$\n10^{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{41}=97+\\frac{23}{41}\n$$\n\nThe idea is that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{41}=0 . \\overline{02439} \\\\\n& \\frac{4}{41}=0 . \\overline{09756} \\\\\n& \\frac{23}{41}=0 . \\overline{56097}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand so $c=2349$ works; we get $4 c=9756$ and $23 c=56097$ which are cyclic shifts of each other by $3$ places (with some leading zeros appended).\n\nHere is the one to use:\nClaim - There exists positive integers $D$ and $e$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}(D, 10)=1, D>$ $\\max (m, n)$, and moreover\n\n$$\n\\frac{10^{e} m-n}{D} \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nProof. Suppose we pick some exponent $e$ and define the number\n\n$$\nA=10^{e} n-m\n$$\n\nLet $r=\\nu_{2}(m)$ and $s=\\nu_{5}(m)$. As long as $e>\\max (r, s)$ we have $\\nu_{2}(A)=r$ and $\\nu_{5}(A)=s$, too. Now choose any $e>\\max (r, s)$ big enough that $A>2^{r} 5^{s} \\max (m, n)$ also holds. Then the number $D=\\frac{A}{2^{2} 5^{s}}$ works; the first two properties hold by construction and\n\n$$\n10^{e} \\cdot \\frac{n}{D}-\\frac{m}{D}=\\frac{A}{D}=2^{r} 5^{s}\n$$\nis an integer.\n\nRemark (For people who like obscure theorems). Kobayashi's theorem implies we can actually pick $D$ to be prime.\n\nNow we take $c$ to be the number under the bar of $1 / D$ (leading zeros removed). Then the decimal representation of $\\frac{m}{D}$ is the decimal representation of cm repeated (possibly including leading zeros). Similarly, $\\frac{n}{D}$ has the decimal representation of cm repeated (possibly including leading zeros). Finally, since\n\n$$\n10^{e} \\cdot \\frac{m}{D}-\\frac{n}{D} \\text { is an integer }\n$$\nit follows that these repeating decimal representations are rotations of each other by $e$ places, so in particular they have the same number of nonzero digits.\n\nRemark. Many students tried to find a $D$ satisfying the stronger hypothesis that $1 / D$, $2 / D, \\ldots,(D-1) / D$ are cyclic shifts of each other. For example, this holds in the famous $D=7$ case.\n\nThe official USAMO $2013$ solutions try to do this by proving that $10$ is a primitive root modulo $7^{e}$ for each $e \\geq 1$, by Hensel lifting lemma. I think this argument is actually incorrect, because it breaks if either $m$ or $n$ are divisible by $7$. Put bluntly, $\\frac{7}{49}$ and $\\frac{8}{49}$ are not shifts of each other.\n\nOne may be tempted to resort to using large primes $D$ rather than powers of $7$ to deal with this issue. However it is an open conjecture (a special case of Artin's primitive root conjecture) whether or not $10(\\bmod p)$ is primitive infinitely often, which is the necessary conjecture so this is harder than it seems.",

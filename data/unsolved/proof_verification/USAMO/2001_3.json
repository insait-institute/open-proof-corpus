            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nLet $a, b, c$ be nonnegative real numbers such that $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+a b c=4$. Show that\n\n$$\n0 \\leq a b+b c+c a-a b c \\leq 2\n$$\n\nThe left-hand side of the inequality is trivial; just note that $\\min \\{a, b, c\\} \\leq 1$. Hence, we focus on the right side. We use Lagrange Multipliers.\n\nDefine\n\n$$\nU=\\left\\{(a, b, c) \\mid a, b, c>0 \\text { and } a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}<1000\\right\\} .\n$$\n\nThis is an intersection of open sets, so it is open. Its closure is\n\n$$\n\\bar{U}=\\left\\{(a, b, c) \\mid a, b, c \\geq 0 \\text { and } a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} \\leq 1000\\right\\} .\n$$\n\nHence the constraint set\n\n$$\n\\bar{S}=\\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\bar{U}: g(\\bar{x})=4\\}\n$$\nis compact, where $g(a, b, c)=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+a b c$.\nDefine\n$$\nf(a, b, c)=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+a b+b c+c a\n$$\n\nIt's equivalent to show that $f \\leq 6$ subject to $g$. Over $\\bar{S}$, it must achieve a global maximum. Now we consider two cases.\n\nIf $\\mathbf{x}$ lies on the boundary, that means one of the components is zero (since $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=$ $1000$ is clearly impossible). WLOG $c=0$, then we wish to show $a^{2}+b^{2}+a b \\leq 6$ for $a^{2}+b^{2}=4$, which is trivial.\n\nNow for the interior $U$, we may use the method of Lagrange Multipliers. Consider a local maximum $\\mathbf{x} \\in U$. Compute\n\n$$\n\\nabla f=\\langle 2 a+b+c, 2 b+c+a, 2 c+a+b\\rangle\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\nabla g=\\langle 2 a+b c, 2 b+c a, 2 c+a b\\rangle\n$$\n\nOf course, $\\nabla g \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ everywhere, so introducing our multiplier yields\n\n$$\n\\langle 2 a+b+c, a+2 b+c, a+b+2 c\\rangle=\\lambda\\langle 2 a+b c, 2 b+c a, 2 c+a b\\rangle .\n$$\n\nNote that $\\lambda \\neq 0$ since $a, b, c>0$. Subtracting $2 a+b+c=\\lambda(2 a+b c)$ from $a+2 b+c=$ $\\lambda(2 b+c a)$ implies that\n\n$$\n(a-b)([2 \\lambda-1]-\\lambda c)=0 .\n$$\n\nWe can derive similar equations for the others. Hence, we have three cases.\n\n1. If $a=b=c$, then $a=b=c=1$, and this satisfies $f(1,1,1) \\leq 6$.\n2. If $a, b, c$ are pairwise distinct, then we derive $a=b=c=2-\\lambda^{-1}$, contradiction.\n3. Now suppose that $a=b \\neq c$.\n\nMeanwhile, the constraint (with $a=b$ ) reads\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+a b c=4 & \\Longleftrightarrow c^{2}+a^{2} c+\\left(2 a^{2}-4\\right)=0 \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow(c+2)\\left(c-\\left(2-a^{2}\\right)\\right)=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich since $c>0$ gives $c=2-a^{2}$.\nNoah Walsh points out that at this point, we don't need to calculate the critical point; we just directly substitute $a=b$ and $c=2-a^{2}$ into the desired inequality:\n\n$$\na^{2}+2 a(2-a)^{2}-a^{2}(2-a)^{2}=2-(a-1)^{2}\\left(a^{2}-4 a+2\\right) \\leq 0\n$$\n\nSo any point here satisfies the inequality anyways.\n\nRemark. It can actually be shown that the critical point in the third case we skipped is pretty close: it is given by\n\n$$\na=b=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{17}}{4} \\quad c=\\frac{1}{8}(7-\\sqrt{17}) .\n$$\n\nThis satisfies\n\n$$\nf(a, b, c)=3 a^{2}+2 a c+c^{2}=\\frac{1}{32}(121+17 \\sqrt{17}) \\approx 5.97165\n$$\nwhich is just a bit less than $6$.\n\nRemark. Equality holds for the upper bound if $(a, b, c)=(1,1,1)$ or $(a, b, c)=(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and permutations. The lower bound is achieved if $(a, b, c)=(2,0,0)$ and permutations.",

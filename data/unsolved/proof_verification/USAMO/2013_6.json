            "solution": "Let $A B C$ be a triangle. Find all points $P$ on segment $B C$ satisfying the following property: If $X$ and $Y$ are the intersections of line $P A$ with the common external tangent lines of the circumcircles of triangles $P A B$ and $P A C$, then\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{P A}{X Y}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{P B \\cdot P C}{A B \\cdot A C}=1\n$$\n\nLet $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ denote the circumcenters of $P A B$ and $P A C$. The main idea is to notice that $\\triangle A B C$ and $\\triangle A O_{1} O_{2}$ are spirally similar.\n\nClaim (Salmon theorem) - We have $\\triangle A B C \\stackrel{ }{\\sim} \\triangle A O_{1} O_{2}$.\n\nProof. We first claim $\\triangle A O_{1} B \\stackrel{+}{\\sim} \\triangle A O_{2} C$. Assume without loss of generality that $\\angle A P B \\leq 90^{\\circ}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\angle A O_{1} B=2 \\angle A P B\n$$\nbut\n$$\n\\angle A O_{2} C=2(180-\\angle A P C)=2 \\angle A B P .\n$$\n\nHence $\\angle A O_{1} B=\\angle A O_{2} C$. Moreover, both triangles are isosceles, establishing the first similarity. The second part follows from spiral similarities coming in pairs.\n\nClaim - We always have\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{P A}{X Y}\\right)^{2}=1-\\left(\\frac{a}{b+c}\\right)^{2} .\n$$\n(In particular, this does not depend on $P$.)\nProof. We now delete the points $B$ and $C$ and remember only the fact that $\\triangle A O_{1} O_{2}$ has angles $A, B, C$. The rest is a computation and several approaches are possible.\n\nWithout loss of generality $A$ is closer to $X$ than $Y$, and let the common tangents be $\\overline{X_{1} X_{2}}$ and $\\overline{Y_{1} Y_{2}}$. We'll perform the main calculation with the convenient scaling $O_{B} O_{C}=a, A O_{C}=b$, and $A O_{B}=c$. Let $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ be the tangency points of $X$, and let $h=A M$ be the height of $\\triangle A O_{B} O_{C}$.\n\nNote that by Power of a Point, we have $X X_{1}^{2}=X X_{2}^{2}=X M^{2}-h^{2}$. Also, by Pythagorean theorem we easily obtain $X_{1} X_{2}=a^{2}-(b-c)^{2}$. So putting these together gives\n\n$$\nX M^{2}-h^{2}=\\frac{a^{2}-(b-c)^{2}}{4}=\\frac{(a+b-c)(a-b+c)}{4}=(s-b)(s-c) .\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have\nThen\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{X M^{2}}{h^{2}} & =1+\\frac{(s-b)(s-c)}{h^{2}}=1+\\frac{a^{2}(s-b)(s-c)}{a^{2} h^{2}} \\\\\n& =1+\\frac{a^{2}(s-b)(s-c)}{4 s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}=1+\\frac{a^{2}}{4 s(s-a)} \\\\\n& =1+\\frac{a^{2}}{(b+c)^{2}-a^{2}}=\\frac{(b+c)^{2}}{(b+c)^{2}-a^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{P A}{X Y}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{h}{X M}\\right)^{2}=1-\\left(\\frac{a}{b+c}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nTo finish, note that when $P$ is the foot of the $\\angle A$-bisector, we necessarily have\n\n$$\n\\frac{P B \\cdot P C}{A B \\cdot A C}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{b}{b+c} a\\right)\\left(\\frac{c}{b+c} a\\right)}{b c}=\\left(\\frac{a}{b+c}\\right)^{2} .\n$$\n\nSince there are clearly at most two solutions as $\\frac{P A}{X Y}$ is fixed, these are the only two solutions.",

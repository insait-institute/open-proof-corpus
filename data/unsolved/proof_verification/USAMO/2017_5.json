            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nFind all real numbers $c>0$ such that there exists a labeling of the lattice points in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ with positive integers for which:\n\n- only finitely many distinct labels occur, and\n- for each label $i$, the distance between any two points labeled $i$ is at least $c^{i}$.\n\nThe answer is $c<\\sqrt{2}$. Here is a solution with Calvin Deng.\nThe construction for any $c<\\sqrt{2}$ can be done as follows. Checkerboard color the lattice points and label the black ones with $1$. The white points then form a copy of $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ again scaled up by $\\sqrt{2}$ so we can repeat the procedure with $2$ on half the resulting points. Continue this dyadic construction until a large $N$ for which $c^{N}<2^{\\frac{1}{2}(N-1)}$, at which point we can just label all the points with $N$.\n\nI'll now prove that $c=\\sqrt{2}$ (and hence $c \\geq \\sqrt{2}$ ) can't be done.\nClaim - It is impossible to fill a $2^{n} \\times 2^{n}$ square with labels not exceeding $2 n$.\nThe case $n=1$ is clear. So now assume it's true up to $n-1$; and assume for contradiction a $2^{n} \\times 2^{n}$ square $S$ only contains labels up to $2 n$. (Of course every $2^{n-1} \\times 2^{n-1}$ square contains an instance of a label at least $2 n-1$.)\n\n\nNow, we contend there are fewer than four copies of $2 n$ :\n\n## Lemma\n\nIn a unit square, among any four points, two of these points have distance $\\leq 1$ apart.\n\nProof. Look at the four rays emanating from the origin and note that two of them have included angle $\\leq 90^{\\circ}$.\n\nSo WLOG the northwest quadrant has no $2 n$ 's. Take a $2 n-1$ in the northwest and draw a square of size $2^{n-1} \\times 2^{n-1}$ directly right of it (with its top edge coinciding with the top of $S$ ). Then $A$ can't contain $2 n-1$, so it must contain a $2 n$ label; that $2 n$ label must be in the northeast quadrant.\n\nThen we define a square $B$ of size $2^{n-1} \\times 2^{n-1}$ as follows. If $2 n-1$ is at least as high $2 n$, let $B$ be a $2^{n-1} \\times 2^{n-1}$ square which touches $2 n-1$ north and is bounded east by $2 n$. Otherwise let $B$ be the square that touches $2 n-1$ west and is bounded north by $2 n$. We then observe $B$ can neither have $2 n-1$ nor $2 n$ in it, contradiction.\n\nRemark. To my knowledge, essentially all density arguments fail because of hexagonal lattice packing.",

            "solution": "We present three general routes. (The second route, using the fact that $\\overline{A C}$ is an angle bisector, has many possible variations.)\n\n\u0433\u0402\u040b First solution (Miquel points). This is indeed a Miquel point problem, but the main idea is to focus on the self-intersecting cyclic quadrilateral $P B Q D$ as the key player, rather than on the given $A B C D$.\n\nIndeed, we will prove that $A$ is its Miquel point; this follows from the following two claims.\n\nClaim - The self-intersecting quadrilateral $P Q D B$ is cyclic.\n\nProof. By power of a point from $C: C Q \\cdot C D=C A \\cdot C E=C B \\cdot C P$.\n\nClaim - Point $E$ lies on line $P Q$.\n\nProof. $\\measuredangle A E P=\\measuredangle A B P=\\measuredangle A B C=\\measuredangle A D C=\\measuredangle A D Q=\\measuredangle A E Q$.\n\n\nTo finish, let $H=\\overline{P D} \\cap \\overline{B Q}$. By properties of the Miquel point, we have $A$ is the foot from $H$ to $\\overline{C E}$. But also, points $M, A, H$ are collinear by Pappus theorem on $\\overline{B P G}$ and $\\overline{D Q F}$, as desired.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 S Second solution (projective). We start with a synthetic observation.\nClaim - The line $\\overline{A C}$ bisects $\\angle P A D$ and $\\angle B A Q$.\nProof. Angle chase: $\\measuredangle P A C=\\measuredangle P A E=\\measuredangle P B E=\\measuredangle C B D=\\measuredangle C A D$.\nThere are three ways to finish from here:\n\n- (Michael Kural) Suppose the external bisector of $\\angle P A D$ and $\\angle B A Q$ meet lines $B C$ and $D C$ at $X$ and $Y$. Then\n\n$$\n-1=(G P ; X C)=(F D ; Y C)\n$$\nwhich is enough to imply that $\\overline{X Y}, \\overline{G Q}, \\overline{P F}$ are concurrent (by so-called prism lemma).\n- (Daniel Liu) Alternatively, apply the dual Desargues involution theorem to complete quadrilateral $G Q F P C M$, through the point $A$. This gives that an involutive pairing of\n$$\n(A C, A M)(A P, A Q)(A G, A F)\n$$\n\nThis is easier to see if we project it onto the line $\\ell$ through $C$ perpendicular to $\\overline{A C}$ : let $P^{\\prime}, Q^{\\prime}, G^{\\prime}, F^{\\prime}$ be the images of the last four lines, so $C$ is the common midpoint of $\\overline{F^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime}}$ and $\\overline{G^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}}$. Hence the involution swapping $G^{\\prime} \\leftrightarrow F^{\\prime}$ and $P^{\\prime} \\leftrightarrow Q^{\\prime}$ coincides with negative inversion through $C$ with power $\\sqrt{C P^{\\prime} \\cdot C Q^{\\prime}}$ which implies that $\\overline{A M} \\cap \\ell$ is an infinity point, as desired.\n\n- (Kada Williams) The official solution instead shows the external angle bisector by a long trig calculation.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Third solution (inversion, Andrew Wu). Noting that $C E \\cdot C A=C P \\cdot C B=C Q \\cdot C D$, we perform an inversion at $C$ swapping these pairs of points. The point $G$ is mapped to a point $G^{*}$ ray $C B$ for which $Q E G^{*} C$ is cyclic, but then\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle C G^{*} E=\\measuredangle C Q E=\\measuredangle C Q P=\\measuredangle D B C=\\measuredangle C B E\n$$\nand so we conclude $E B=E G^{*}$. Similarly, $E D=E F^{*}$.\nFinally, $M^{*}=\\left(C G^{*} D\\right) \\cap\\left(C F^{*} B\\right) \\neq C$, and we wish to show that $\\angle E M^{*} C=90^{\\circ}$.\n\n\nNote that $M^{*}$ is the center of the spiral similarity sending $\\overline{B G^{*}}$ to $\\overline{F^{*} D}$. Hence it also maps the midpoint $K$ of $B G^{*}$ to the midpoint $L$ of $\\overline{F^{*} E}$. Consequently, $M^{*}$ lies on the circumcircle $K L C$ as well. In other words, $E L C K M^{*}$ is a cyclic pentagon with circumdiameter $\\overline{C E}$, as desired.",

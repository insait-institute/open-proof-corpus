            "solution": "It's equivalent to $m s \\bmod p<n s \\bmod p<s$, where $x \\bmod p$ means the remainder when $x$ is divided by $p$, by slight abuse of notation. We will assume $s \\geq 2$ for simplicity, since the case $s=1$ is clear.\n\nFor any $x \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, s-1\\}$ we define $f(x)$ to be the unique number in $\\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$ such that $s \\cdot f(x) \\bmod p=x$. Then, $m$ and $n$ fail to exist exactly when\n\n$$\nf(s-1)<f(s-2)<\\cdots<f(1)\n$$\n\nWe give the following explicit description of $f$ : choose $t \\equiv-s^{-1}(\\bmod p), 0<t<p$. Then $f(x)=1+(s-x) \\cdot t \\bmod p$. So our displayed inequality is equivalent to\n\n$$\n(1+t) \\bmod p<(1+2 t) \\bmod p<(1+3 t) \\bmod p<\\cdots<(1+(s-1) t) \\bmod p\n$$\n\nThis just means that the sequence $1+k t$ never \"wraps around\" modulo $p$ as we take $k=1,2, \\ldots, s-1$.\n\nSince we assumed $s \\neq 1$, we have $0<1+t<p$. Now since $1+k t$ never wraps around as $k=1,2, \\ldots, s-1$, and increases in increments of $t$, it follows that $1+k t<p$ for all $k=1,2, \\ldots, s-1$. Finally, as $1+s t \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$ we get $1+s t=p$.\n\nIn summary, $m, n$ fail to exist precisely when $1+s t=p$. That is of course equivalent to $s \\mid p-1$.",

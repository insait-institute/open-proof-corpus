In every column with more than two tokens, we have token emit a bidirectional horizontal death ray (laser) covering its entire row: the hypothesis is that the death ray won't hit any other tokens.\n\n\nAssume there are $n$ tokens and that $n>1000$. Then obviously some column has more than two tokens, so at most $999$ tokens don't emit a death ray (namely, any token in its own column). Thus there are at least $n-999$ death rays. On the other hand, we can have at most $999$ death rays total (since it would not be okay for the whole board to have death rays, as some row should have more than two tokens). Therefore, $n \\leq 999+999=1998$ as desired.",

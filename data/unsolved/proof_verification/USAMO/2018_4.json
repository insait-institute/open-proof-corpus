This graph has at least $\\frac{1}{2}(p+1)$ connected components, as desired.\n\nRemark. Here is an example for $p=5$ showing equality can occur:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{lllll}\n0 & 0 & 3 & 4 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right] .\n$$\n\nAnkan Bhattacharya points out more generally that $a_{i}=i^{2}$ is sharp in general.",

Prove that it is possible to color every subset of $S$ either black or white so that the following conditions hold:  \n(a) the union of any two white subsets is white;  \n(b) the union of any two black subsets is black;  \n(c) there are exactly $N$ white subsets.\n\nWe will solve the problem with $2002$ replaced by an arbitrary integer $n \\geq 0$. In other words, we prove:\n\nClaim - For any nonnegative integers $n$ and $N$ with $0 \\leq N \\leq 2^{n}$, it is possible to color the $2^{n}$ subsets of $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ black and white satisfying the conditions of the problem.\n\nThe proof is by induction on $n$. When $n=1$ the problem is easy to do by hand, so this gives us a base case.\n\nFor the inductive step, we divide into two cases:\n\n- If $N \\leq 2^{n-1}$, then we take a coloring of subsets of $\\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ with $N$ white sets; then we color the remaining $2^{n-1}$ sets (which contain $n$ ) black.\n- If $N>2^{n-1}$, then we take a coloring of subsets of $\\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ with $N-2^{n-1}$ white sets; then we color the remaining $2^{n-1}$ sets (which contain $n$ ) white.",

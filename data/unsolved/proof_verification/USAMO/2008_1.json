We first state:\n\n## Theorem $1.1$ (Schur's theorem)\n\nIf $P(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is nonconstant and $P(0)=1$, then there are infinitely many primes which divide $P(t)$ for some integer $t$.\n\nProof. If $P(0)=0$, this is clear. So assume $P(0)=c \\neq 0$.  \nLet $S$ be any finite set of prime numbers. Consider then the value\n\n$$\nP\\left(k \\prod_{p \\in S} p\\right)\n$$\nfor some integer $k$. It is $1(\\bmod p)$ for each prime $p$, and if $k$ is large enough it should not be equal to $1$ (because $P$ is not constant). Therefore, it has a prime divisor not in $S$.\n\nRemark. In fact the result holds without the assumption $P(0) \\neq 1$. The proof requires only small modifications, and a good exercise would be to write down a similar proof that works first for $P(0)=20$, and then for any $P(0) \\neq 0$. (The $P(0)=0$ case is vacuous, since then $P(x)$ is divisible by $x$.)\n\nTo finish the proof, let $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n}$ be primes and $x_{i}$ be integers such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP\\left(x_{1}\\right) & \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod p_{1}\\right) \\\\\nP\\left(x_{2}\\right) & \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod p_{2}\\right) \\\\\n\\vdots & \\\\\nP\\left(x_{n}\\right) & \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod p_{n}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas promised by Schur's theorem. Then, by Chinese remainder theorem, we can find $x$ such that $x \\equiv x_{i}\\left(\\bmod p_{i}\\right)$ for each $i$, whence $P(x)$ has at least $n$ prime factor.",

Suppose for contradiction that $2^{k}-1>N$ and choose $x_{n}=-n$ for each $n=1, \\ldots, N$. Now for each index $1 \\leq n \\leq N$, define\n\n$$\nS(n)=\\left\\{\\text { indices } i \\text { for which } f_{i}(n) \\neq 0\\right\\} \\subseteq\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}\n$$\n\nAs each $S(n t)$ is nonempty, by pigeonhole, two $S(n)$ 's coincide, say $S(n)=S\\left(n^{\\prime}\\right)$ for $n<n^{\\prime}$. But it's plainly impossible that $x_{n}>x_{n^{\\prime}}$ in that case due to the essentially increasing condition.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452T Construction. It suffices to do $N=2^{k}-1$. Rather than drown the reader in notation, we'll just illustrate an example of the (inductive) construction for $k=4$. Empty cells are zero.\n\n|  | $f_{1}$ | $f_{2}$ | $f_{3}$ | $f_{4}$ |\n| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| $x_{1}=3$ | $3$ |  |  |  |\n| $x_{2}=1$ | $10$ | $-9$ |  |  |\n| $x_{3}=4$ |  | $4$ |  |  |\n| $x_{4}=1$ | $100$ | $200$ | $-\\mathbf{2 9 9}$ |  |\n| $x_{5}=5$ |  | $200$ | $-195$ |  |\n| $x_{6}=9$ | $100$ |  | $-91$ |  |\n| $x_{7}=2$ |  |  | $2$ |  |\n| $x_{8}=6$ | $1000$ | $2000$ | $4000$ | $-6994$ |\n| $x_{9}=5$ |  | $2000$ | $4000$ | $-5995$ |\n| $x_{10}=3$ | $1000$ |  | $4000$ | $-4997$ |\n| $x_{11}=5$ |  |  | $4000$ | $-3995$ |\n| $x_{12}=8$ | $1000$ | $2000$ |  | $-\\mathbf{2 9 9 2}$ |\n| $x_{13}=9$ |  | $2000$ |  | $-1991$ |\n| $x_{14}=7$ | $1000$ |  |  | $-993$ |\n| $x_{15}=9$ |  |  |  | $9$ |\n\nThe general case is handled in the same way with powers of $10$ replaced by powers of $B$, for a sufficiently large number $B$.",

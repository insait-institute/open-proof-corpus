Either prove the assertion or find (with proof) a counterexample.\n\nWe claim $n=25$ is a counterexample. Since $2^{25} \\equiv 2^{0}\\left(\\bmod 2^{25}-1\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\n2^{2^{25}} \\equiv 2^{2^{25} \\bmod 25} \\equiv 2^{7} \\bmod 2^{25}-1\n$$\nand the right-hand side is actually the remainder, since $0<2^{7}<2^{25}$. But $2^{7}$ is not a power of $4$.\n\nRemark. Really, the problem is just equivalent for asking $2^{n}$ to have odd remainder when divided by $n$.",

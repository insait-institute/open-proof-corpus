            "solution": "We present two solutions.\n\u3010 First solution. Let $I_{A}$ denote the $A$-excenter and $I$ the incenter. Then let $D$ denote the foot of the altitude from $A$. Suppose the $A$-excircle is tangent to $\\overline{B C}, \\overline{A B}, \\overline{A C}$ at $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ and let $A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2}$ denote the reflections of $I_{A}$ across these points. Let $S$ denote the circumcenter of $\\triangle I I_{B} I_{C}$.\n\n\nWe begin with the following observation:\nClaim - Points $D, I, A_{2}$ are collinear. Similarly, points $E, I_{C}, C_{2}$ are collinear and points $F, I_{B}, B_{2}$ are collinear.\n\nProof. This basically follows from the \"midpoints of altitudes\" lemma. To see $D, I, A_{2}$ are collinear, recall first that $\\overline{I A_{1}}$ passes through the midpoint $M$ of $\\overline{A D}$.\n\n\nNow since $\\overline{A D} \\| \\overline{I_{A} A_{2}}$, and $M$ and $A_{1}$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{A D}$ and $\\overline{I_{A} A_{2}}$, it follows from the collinearity of $A, I, I_{A}$ that $D, I, A_{2}$ are collinear as well.\n\nThe other two claims follow in a dual fashion. For example, using the homothety taking the $A$ to $C$-excircle, we find that $\\overline{C_{1} I_{C}}$ bisects the altitude $\\overline{B E}$. (The homothety at $B$ will send $C_{1}$ to the point on the $C$-excircle which is diametrically opposite the foot from $I_{C}$ to $A C$. This diameter of the $C$-excircle is then mapped through homothety through $C_{1}$ onto the $B$-altitude.) Then since $I_{C}, B, I_{A}$ are collinear the same argument now gives $I_{C}, E, C_{2}$ are collinear. The fact that $I_{B}, F, B_{2}$ are collinear is symmetric.\n\nObserve that $\\overline{B_{2} C_{2}}\\left\\|\\overline{B_{1} C_{1}}\\right\\| \\overline{I_{B} I_{C}}$. Proceeding similarly on the other sides, we discover $\\triangle I I_{B} I_{C}$ and $\\triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}$ are homothetic. Hence $P$ is the center of this homothety (in particular, $D, I, P, A_{2}$ are collinear). Moreover, $P$ lies on the line joining $I_{A}$ to $S$, which is the Euler line of $\\triangle I I_{B} I_{C}$, so it passes through the nine-point center of $\\triangle I I_{B} I_{C}$, which is $O$. Consequently, $P, O, I_{A}$ are collinear as well.\n\nTo finish, we need only prove that $\\overline{O S} \\perp \\overline{Y Z}$. In fact, we claim that $\\overline{Y Z}$ is the radical axis of the circumcircles of $\\triangle A B C$ and $\\triangle I I_{B} I_{C}$. Actually, $Y$ is the radical center of these two circumcircles and the circle with diameter $\\overline{I I_{B}}$ (which passes through $A$ and $C)$. Analogously $Z$ is the radical center of the circumcircles and the circle with diameter $\\overline{I I_{C}}$, and the proof is complete.\n\nI Second solution (barycentric, outline, Colin Tang). we are going to use barycentric coordinates to show that the line through $O$ perpendicular to $\\overline{Y Z}$ is concurrent with $\\overline{I_{B} F}$ and $\\overline{I_{C} E}$.\n\nThe displacement vector $\\overrightarrow{Y Z}$ is proportional to $(a(b-c):-b(a+c): c(a+b))$, and so by strong perpendicularity criterion and doing a calculation gives the line\n\n$$\nx(b-c) b c(a+b+c)+y(a+c) a c(a+b-c)+z(a+b) a b(-a+b-c)=0 .\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, line $I_{C} E$ has equation\n\n$$\n0=\\operatorname{det}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\na & b & -c \\\\\nS_{C} & 0 & S_{A} \\\\\nx & y & z\n\\end{array}\\right]=b S_{a} \\cdot x+\\left(-c S_{C}-a S_{A}\\right) \\cdot y+\\left(-b S_{C}\\right) \\cdot z\n$$\n\nand similarly for $I_{B} F$. Consequently, concurrence of these lines is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\nb S_{A} & -c S_{C}-a S_{A} & -b S_{C} \\\\\nc S_{A} & -c S_{B} & -a S_{A}-b S_{B} \\\\\n(b-c) b c(a+b+c) & (a+c) a c(a+b-c) & (a+b) a b(-a+b-c)\n\\end{array}\\right]=0\n$$\n\nwhich is a computation.\n\u3010 Authorship comments. I was intrigued by a Taiwan TST problem which implied that, in the configuration above, $\\angle I_{B} D I_{C}$ was bisected by $\\overline{D A}$. This motivated me to draw all three properties above where $I_{A}$ and $P$ were isogonal conjugates with respect to $D E F$. After playing around with this picture for a long time, I finally noticed that $O$ was on line $P I_{A}$. (So the original was to show that $I_{B} F, I_{C} E, D A_{2}$ concurrent). Eventually I finally noticed in the picture that $P I_{A}$ actually passed through the circumcenter of $A B C$ as well. This took me many hours to prove.\n\nThe final restatement (which follows quickly from $P, O, I_{A}$ collinear) was discovered by Telv Cohl when I showed him the problem.",

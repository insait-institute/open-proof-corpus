Let $x_{1} \\geq x_{2} \\geq \\cdots \\geq x_{n}$ and $y_{1} \\geq y_{2} \\geq \\cdots \\geq y_{n}$ be $2 n$ real numbers such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{n}=y_{1}+y_{2}+\\cdots+y_{n} \\\\\n\\text { and } \\quad 1 & =x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+x_{n}^{2}=y_{1}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+y_{n}^{2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProve that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(x_{i} y_{i}-x_{i} y_{n+1-i}\\right) \\geq \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n-1}}\n$$\n\nWe present two approaches. In both approaches, it's helpful motivation that for even $n$, equality occurs at\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(x_{i}\\right)=(\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}}_{n / 2}, \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\ldots,-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}}_{n / 2}) \\\\\n& \\left(y_{i}\\right)=(\\frac{n-1}{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}},-\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}}, \\ldots,-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}}}_{n-1})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\\ First approach (expected value). For a permutation $\\sigma$ on $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ we define\n\n$$\nS_{\\sigma}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} y_{\\sigma(i)}\n$$\n\nClaim - For random permutations $\\sigma, \\mathbb{E}\\left[S_{\\sigma}\\right]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}\\left[S_{\\sigma}^{2}\\right]=\\frac{1}{n-1}$.\n\nProof. The first one is clear.\nSince $\\sum_{i<j} 2 x_{i} x_{j}=-1$, it follows that (for fixed $i$ and $\\left.j\\right), \\mathbb{E}\\left[y_{\\sigma(i)} y_{\\sigma(j)}\\right]=-\\frac{1}{n(n-1)}$, Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i} x_{i}^{2} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[y_{\\sigma(i)}^{2}\\right] & =\\frac{1}{n} \\\\\n2 \\sum_{i<j} x_{i} x_{j} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[y_{\\sigma(i)} y_{\\sigma(j)}\\right] & =(-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n(n-1)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthe conclusion follows.\n\nClaim (A random variable in $[0,1]$ has variance at most $1 / 4$ ) - If $A$ is a random\nvariable with mean $\\mu$ taking values in the closed interval $[m, M]$ then\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[(A-\\mu)^{2}\\right] \\leq \\frac{1}{4}(M-m)^{2} .\n$$\n\nProof. By shifting and scaling, we may assume $m=0$ and $M=1$, so $A \\in[0,1]$ and hence $A^{2} \\leq A$. Then\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[(A-\\mu)^{2}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[A^{2}\\right]-\\mu^{2} \\leq \\mathbb{E}[A]-\\mu^{2}=\\mu-\\mu^{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nThis concludes the proof.\nThus the previous two claims together give\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\sigma} S_{\\sigma}-\\min _{\\sigma} S_{\\sigma} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{n-1}}=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n-1}}\n$$\n\nBut $\\sum_{i} x_{i} y_{i}=\\max _{\\sigma} S_{\\sigma}$ and $\\sum_{i} x_{i} y_{n+1-i}=\\min _{\\sigma} S_{\\sigma}$ by rearrangement inequality and therefore we are done.\n\\T Outline of second approach (by convexity, due to Alex Zhai). We will instead prove a converse result: given the hypotheses\n\n- $x_{1} \\geq \\cdots \\geq x_{n}$\n- $y_{1} \\geq \\cdots \\geq y_{n}$\n- $\\sum_{i} x_{i}=\\sum_{i} y_{i}=0$\n- $\\sum_{i} x_{i} y_{i}-\\sum_{i} x_{i} y_{n+1-i}=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n-1}}$\nwe will prove that $\\sum x_{i}^{2} \\sum y_{i}^{2} \\leq 1$.\nFix the choice of $y$ 's. We see that we are trying to maximize a convex function in $n$ variables $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ over a convex domain (actually the intersection of two planes with several half planes). So a maximum can only happen at the boundaries: when at most two of the $x$ 's are different.\n\nAn analogous argument applies to $y$. In this way we find that it suffices to consider situations where $x_{\\bullet}$ takes on at most two different values. The same argument applies to y.\n\nAt this point the problem can be checked directly.",

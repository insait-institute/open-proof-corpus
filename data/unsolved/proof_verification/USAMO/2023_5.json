            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nLet $n \\geq 3$ be an integer. We say that an arrangement of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, n^{2}$ in an $n \\times n$ table is row-valid if the numbers in each row can be permuted to form an arithmetic progression, and column-valid if the numbers in each column can be permuted to form an arithmetic progression.\n\nFor what values of $n$ is it possible to transform any row-valid arrangement into a column-valid arrangement by permuting the numbers in each row?\n\nAnswer: $n$ prime only.\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Proof for $n$ prime. Suppose $n=p$. In an arithmetic progression with $p$ terms, it's easy to see that either every term has a different residue modulo $p$ (if the common difference is not a multiple of $p$ ), or all of the residues coincide (when the common difference is a multiple of $p$ ).\n\nSo, look at the multiples of $p$ in a row-valid table; there is either $1$ or $p$ per row. As there are $p$ such numbers total, there are two cases:\n\n- If all the multiples of $p$ are in the same row, then the common difference in each row is a multiple of $p$. In fact, it must be exactly $p$ for size reasons. In other words, up to permutation the rows are just the $k(\\bmod p)$ numbers in some order, and this is obviously column-valid because we can now permute such that the $k$ th column contains exactly $\\{(k-1) p+1,(k-1) p+2, \\ldots, k p\\}$.\n- If all the multiples of $p$ are in different rows, then it follows each row contains every residue modulo $p$ exactly once. So we can permute to a column-valid arrangement by ensuring the $k$ th column contains all the $k(\\bmod p)$ numbers.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452 Counterexample for $n$ composite (due to Anton Trygub). Let $p$ be any prime divisor of $n$. Construct the table as follows:\n\n- Row $1$ contains $1$ through $n$.\n- Rows $2$ through $p+1$ contain the numbers from $p+1$ to $n p+n$ partitioned into arithmetic progressions with common difference $p$.\n- The rest of the rows contain the remaining numbers in reading order.\n\nFor example, when $p=2$ and $n=10$, we get the following table:\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccccccc}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\ 11 & 13 & 15 & 17 & 19 & 21 & 23 & 25 & 27 & 29 \\\\ 12 & \\mathbf{1 4} & 16 & 18 & 20 & 22 & 24 & 26 & 28 & 30 \\\\ 31 & 32 & 33 & 34 & 35 & 36 & 37 & 38 & 39 & 40 \\\\ 41 & 42 & 43 & 44 & 45 & 46 & 47 & 48 & 49 & 50 \\\\ 51 & 52 & 53 & 54 & 55 & 56 & 57 & 58 & 59 & 60 \\\\ 61 & 62 & 63 & 64 & 65 & 66 & 67 & 68 & 69 & 70 \\\\ 71 & 72 & 73 & 74 & 75 & 76 & 77 & 78 & 79 & 80 \\\\ 81 & 82 & 83 & 84 & 85 & 86 & 87 & 88 & 89 & 90 \\\\ 91 & 92 & 93 & 94 & 95 & 96 & 97 & 98 & 99 & 100\\end{array}\\right]$\n\nWe claim this works fine. Assume for contradiction the rows may be permuted to obtain a column-valid arrangement. Then the $n$ columns should be arithmetic progressions whose smallest element is in $[1, n]$ and whose largest element is in $\\left[n^{2}-n+1, n^{2}\\right]$. These two elements must be congruent modulo $n-1$, so in particular the column containing $2$ must end with $n^{2}-n+2$.\n\nHence in that column, the common difference must in fact be exactly $n$. And yet $n+2$ and $2 n+2$ are in the same row, contradiction.",

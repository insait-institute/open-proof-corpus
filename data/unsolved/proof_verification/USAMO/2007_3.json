Prove that there are at least $n$ pairwise disjoint sets in the same class.\n\nWe present two solutions which are really equivalent, but phrased differently. We refer to the two classes as \"red\" and \"blue\", respectively.\n\n\u0433\u0402\u0452I First solution (Grant Yu). We define a set of $n+1$ elements to be useful if it has $n$-element subsets in each class.\n\nConsider a maximal collection of disjoint useful sets and assume there are $p$ such sets. Then, let $T$ be the set of elements remaining (i.e. not in one of chosen useful sets).\n\nClaim - All subsets of $T$ of size $n$ are the same color.\nProof. Assume there was a red set $R$ in $T$. Replace the elements of $R$ one by one until we get to any other subset $R^{\\prime}$ of $T$. At each step, because no sets of $T$ form a useful set, the set remains red - so $R^{\\prime}$ is red too. Since $R^{\\prime}$ is arbitrary, this proves the claim.\n\nWe have $|T|=n^{2}+n-1-p(n+1)$, and in particular $p<n$. WLOG all sets in $T$ are red. We can extract another red set from each of our chosen useful sets. So we can get at least\n\n$$\np+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{|T|}{n}\\right\\rfloor=p+\\left\\lfloor n+1-p-\\frac{1+p}{n}\\right\\rfloor \\geq p+(n-p)=n .\n$$\n\n## \u0433\u0402\u0452 Second solution (by induction). We prove more strongly that:\n\nClaim - Let $S$ be a set containing $k \\cdot(n+1)-1$ elements. Then we can find $k$ pairwise disjoint sets of the same color.\n\nThe proof is by induction on $k \\geq 1$. The base case $k=1$ this is immediate; $\\binom{S}{n}$ is a single set.\n\nFor the inductive step, assume for contradiction the problem fails. Let $T$ be any subset of $S$ of size $(k-1)(n+1)-1$. By the induction hypothesis, among the subsets of $T$ alone, we can already find $k-1$ pairwise disjoint sets of the same color. Now $S \\backslash T$ has size $n+1$, and so we would have to have that all $\\binom{n+1}{n}$ subsets of $S \\backslash T$ are the same color.\n\nBy varying $T$, the set $S \\backslash T$ ranges over all of $\\binom{S}{k+1}$. This causes all sets to be the same color, contradiction.\n\nRemark. Victor Wang writes the following:\nI don't really like this problem, but I think the main motivation for generalizing the problem is that the original problem doesn't allow you to look at small cases. (Also, it's not initially clear where the $n^{2}+n-1$ comes from.) And\npretty much the simplest way to get lots of similarly-flavored small cases is to start with $k=2,3$ in \"find the smallest $N(n, k)$ such that when we partition the $n$-subsets of a $\\geq N(n, k)$-set into $2$ classes, we can find some $k$ pairwise disjoint sets in the same class\".",

            "solution": "This is the official solution; the proof has two main insights.\nThe first idea:\n\n## Lemma\n\nIf a permutation $x$ works, so does the inverse permutation.\nThus it suffices to consider permutations $x$ in which all cycles have length at most $2$. Of course, there can be at most one fixed point (since that gives the ratio $1$ ), and hence exactly one if $n$ is odd, none if $n$ is even.\n\nWe consider the graph $K_{n}$ such that the edge $\\{i, j\\}$ is labeled with $i / j$ (for $i<j$ ). The permutations we're considering are then equivalent to maximal matchings of this $K_{n}$. We call such a matching fantastic if it has all distinct edge labels.\n\nNow the second insight is that if edges $a b$ and $c d$ have the same label for $a<b$ and $c<d$, then so do edges $a c$ and $b d$. Thus:\n\nDefinition. Given a matching $\\mathcal{M}$ as above we say the neighbors of $\\mathcal{M}$ are those other matchings obtained as follows: for each label $\\ell$, we take some disjoint pairs of edges (possibly none) with label $\\ell$ and apply the above switching operation (in which we replace $a b$ and $c d$ with $a c$ and $b d)$.\n\nThis neighborship relation is reflexive, and most importantly it is symmetric (because one can simply reverse the moves). But it is not transitive.\n\nThe second observation is that:\nClaim - The matching $\\mathcal{M}$ has an odd number of neighbors (including itself) if and only if it is fantastic.\n\nProof. Consider the label $\\ell$, and assume it appears $n_{\\ell} \\geq 1$ times.\nIf we pick $k$ disjoint pairs and swap them, the number of ways to do this is $\\binom{n_{\\ell}}{2 k}(2 k-1)!!$, and so the total number of ways to perform operations on the edges labeled $\\ell$ is\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k}\\binom{n_{\\ell}}{2 k}(2 k-1)!!\\equiv \\sum_{k}\\binom{n_{\\ell}}{2 k}=2^{n_{\\ell}-1} \\quad(\\bmod 2)\n$$\n\nThis is even if and only if $n_{\\ell}>1$.\nFinally, note that the number of neighbors of $\\mathcal{M}$ is the product across all $\\ell$ of the above. So it is odd if and only if each factor is odd, if and only if $n_{\\ell}=1$ for every $\\ell$.\n\nTo finish, consider a huge simple graph $\\Gamma$ on all the maximal matchings, with edge relations given by neighbor relation (we don't consider vertices to be connected to themselves). Observe that:\n\n- The fantastic matchings of the vertices of $\\Gamma$ have odd degrees (one less than the neighbor count).\n- The other matchings correspond to isolated vertices (of degree zero, with no other neighbors) of $\\Gamma$.\n- The graph $\\Gamma$ has an even number of vertices of odd degree (this is true for any simple graph, see \"handshake lemma\").\n- The number of vertices of $\\Gamma$ is odd, namely $(2\\lceil n / 2\\rceil-1)$ !!.\n\nThis concludes the proof.",

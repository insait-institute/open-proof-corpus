Prove that there exists a rational number $r$ such that $\\left(s_{i}-s_{j}\\right) r$ and $\\left(t_{i}-t_{j}\\right) / r$ are integers for all $i$ and $j$.\n\nFirst we eliminate the silly edge case:\nClaim - For some $i$ and $j$, we have $\\left(s_{i}-s_{j}\\right)\\left(t_{i}-t_{j}\\right) \\neq 0$.\n\nProof. Assume not. WLOG $s_{1} \\neq s_{2}$, then $t_{1}=t_{2}$. Now select $i$ such that $t_{i} \\neq t_{1}=t_{2}$. Then either $t_{i}-s_{1} \\neq 0$ or $t_{i}-s_{2} \\neq 0$, contradiction.\n\nSo, WLOG (by permutation) that $n=\\left(s_{1}-s_{2}\\right)\\left(t_{1}-t_{2}\\right) \\neq 0$. By shifting and scaling appropriately, we may assume\n\n$$\ns_{1}=t_{1}=0, \\quad s_{2}=1, \\quad t_{2}=n .\n$$\n\nThus we deduce\n\n$$\ns_{i} t_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad s_{i} t_{j}+s_{j} t_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\quad \\forall i, j .\n$$\n\nClaim - For any index $i, t_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}, s_{i} \\in \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nProof. We have $s_{i} t_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $t_{i}+n s_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ by problem condition. By looking at $\\nu_{p}$ of this, we conclude $n s_{i}, t_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (since if either as negative $p$-adic value, so does the other, and then $\\left.s_{i} t_{i} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}\\right)$.\n\nLast claim:\nClaim - If $d=\\operatorname{gcd} t_{\\bullet}$, then $d s_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ for all $i$.\nProof. Consider a prime $p \\mid n$, and let $e=\\nu_{p}\\left(t_{j}\\right)$. We will show $\\nu_{p}\\left(s_{i}\\right) \\geq-e$ for any $i$.\nThis is already true for $i=j$, so assume $i \\neq j$. Assume for contradiction $\\nu_{p}\\left(s_{i}\\right)<-e$. Then $\\nu_{p}\\left(t_{i}\\right)>e=\\nu_{p}\\left(t_{k}\\right)$. Since $\\nu_{p}\\left(s_{k}\\right) \\geq-e$ we deduce $\\nu_{p}\\left(s_{i} t_{k}\\right)<\\nu_{p}\\left(s_{k} t_{i}\\right)$; so $\\nu_{p}\\left(s_{i} t_{k}\\right) \\geq$ $0$ and $\\nu_{p}\\left(s_{i}\\right) \\geq-e$ as desired.",

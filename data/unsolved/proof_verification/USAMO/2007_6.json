            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nLet $A B C$ be an acute triangle with $\\omega, S$, and $R$ being its incircle, circumcircle, and circumradius, respectively. Circle $\\omega_{A}$ is tangent internally to $S$ at $A$ and tangent externally to $\\omega$. Circle $S_{A}$ is tangent internally to $S$ at $A$ and tangent internally to $\\omega$.\n\nLet $P_{A}$ and $Q_{A}$ denote the centers of $\\omega_{A}$ and $S_{A}$, respectively. Define points $P_{B}$, $Q_{B}, P_{C}, Q_{C}$ analogously. Prove that\n\n$$\n8 P_{A} Q_{A} \\cdot P_{B} Q_{B} \\cdot P_{C} Q_{C} \\leq R^{3}\n$$\nwith equality if and only if triangle $A B C$ is equilateral.\n\nIt turns out we can compute $P_{A} Q_{A}$ explicitly. Let us invert around $A$ with radius $s-a$ (hence fixing the incircle) and then compose this with a reflection around the angle bisector of $\\angle B A C$. We denote the image of the composed map via\n\n$$\n\\bullet \\mapsto \\bullet^{*} \\mapsto \\bullet^{+}\n$$\n\nWe overlay this inversion with the original diagram.\nLet $P_{A} Q_{A}$ meet $\\omega_{A}$ again at $P$ and $S_{A}$ again at $Q$. Now observe that $\\omega_{A}^{*}$ is a line parallel to $S^{*}$; that is, it is perpendicular to $\\overline{P Q}$. Moreover, it is tangent to $\\omega^{*}=\\omega$.\n\nNow upon the reflection, we find that $\\omega^{+}=\\omega^{*}=\\omega$, but line $\\overline{P Q}$ gets mapped to the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{B C}$, since $\\overline{P Q}$ originally contained the circumcenter $O$ (isogonal to the orthocenter). But this means that $\\omega_{A}^{*}$ is none other than the $\\overline{B C}$ ! Hence $P^{+}$is actually the foot of the altitude from $A$ onto $\\overline{B C}$.\n\nBy similar work, we find that $Q^{+}$is the point on $\\overline{A P^{+}}$such that $P^{+} Q^{+}=2 r$.\n\n\nNow we can compute all the lengths directly. We have that\n\n$$\nA P_{A}=\\frac{1}{2} A P=\\frac{(s-a)^{2}}{2 A P^{+}}=\\frac{1}{2}(s-a)^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{h_{a}}\n$$\nand\n$$\nA Q_{A}=\\frac{1}{2} A Q=\\frac{(s-a)^{2}}{2 A Q^{+}}=\\frac{1}{2}(s-a)^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}\n$$\n\nwhere $h_{a}=\\frac{2 K}{a}$ is the length of the $A$-altitude, with $K$ the area of $A B C$ as usual. Now it follows that\n\n$$\nP_{A} Q_{A}=\\frac{1}{2}(s-a)^{2}\\left(\\frac{2 r}{h_{a}\\left(h_{a}-2 r\\right)}\\right) .\n$$\n\nThis can be simplified, as\n\n$$\nh_{a}-2 r=\\frac{2 K}{a}-\\frac{2 K}{s}=2 K \\cdot \\frac{s-a}{a s}\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nP_{A} Q_{A}=\\frac{a^{2} r s(s-a)}{4 K^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}(s-a)}{4 K}\n$$\n\nHence, the problem is just asking us to show that\n\n$$\na^{2} b^{2} c^{2}(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) \\leq 8(R K)^{3}\n$$\n\nUsing $a b c=4 R K$ and $(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)=\\frac{1}{s} K^{2}=r K$, we find that this becomes\n\n$$\n2(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) \\leq R K \\Longleftrightarrow 2 r \\leq R\n$$\nwhich follows immediately from $I O^{2}=R(R-2 r)$. Alternatively, one may rewrite this as Schur's Inequality in the form\n$$\na b c \\geq(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)\n$$",

    "problem": "Three nonnegative real numbers \\( r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3} \\) are written on a blackboard. These numbers have the property that there exist integers \\( a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3} \\), not all zero, satisfying \\( a_{1} r_{1} + a_{2} r_{2} + a_{3} r_{3} = 0 \\). We are permitted to perform the following operation: find two numbers \\( x, y \\) on the blackboard with \\( x \\leq y \\), then erase \\( y \\) and write \\( y-x \\) in its place. Prove that after a finite number of such operations, we can end up with at least one \\( 0 \\) on the blackboard.",

Assume $a_{1}>0$ and $r_{1}>r_{2}>r_{3}$ without loss of generality and consider two cases.\n\n- Suppose $a_{2}>0$ or $a_{3}>0$; these cases are identical. (One cannot have both $a_{2}>0$ and $a_{3}>0$.) If $a_{2}>0$ then $a_{3}<0$ and get\n\n$$\n0=a_{1} r_{1}+a_{2} r_{2}+a_{3} r_{3}>a_{1} r_{3}+a_{3} r_{3} \\Longrightarrow a_{1}+a_{3}<0\n$$\nso $\\left|a_{1}+a_{3}\\right|<\\left|a_{3}\\right|$, and hence we perform $\\left(r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}\\right) \\mapsto\\left(r_{1}-r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{3}\\right)$.\n\n- Both $a_{2}<0$ and $a_{3}<0$. Assume for contradiction that $\\left|a_{1}+a_{2}\\right| \\geq-a_{2}$ and $\\left|a_{1}+a_{3}\\right| \\geq-a_{3}$ both hold (if either fails then we use $\\left(r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}\\right) \\mapsto\\left(r_{1}-r_{2}, r_{2}, r_{3}\\right)$ and $\\left(r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}\\right) \\mapsto\\left(r_{1}-r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{3}\\right)$, respectively). Clearly $a_{1}+a_{2}$ and $a_{1}+a_{3}$ are both positive in this case, so we get $a_{1}+2 a_{2}$ and $a_{1}+2 a_{3} \\geq 0$; adding gives $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3} \\geq 0$. But\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =a_{1} r_{1}+a_{2} r_{2}+a_{3} r_{3} \\\\\n& >a_{1} r_{2}+a_{2} r_{2}+a_{3} r_{2} \\\\\n& =r_{2}\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}\\right) \\\\\n\\Longrightarrow 0 & <a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince this covers all cases, we see that we can always decrease $\\left|a_{1}\\right|+\\left|a_{2}\\right|+\\left|a_{3}\\right|$ whenever $0 \\notin\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\\right\\}$. Because the $a_{i}$ are integers this cannot occur indefinitely, so eventually one of the $a_{i}$ 's is zero. At this point we can just apply the Euclidean Algorithm, so we're done.",

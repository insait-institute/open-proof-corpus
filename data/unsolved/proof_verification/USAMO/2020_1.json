            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nLet $A B C$ be a fixed acute triangle inscribed in a circle $\\omega$ with center $O$. A variable point $X$ is chosen on minor arc $A B$ of $\\omega$, and segments $C X$ and $A B$ meet at $D$. Denote by $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ the circumcenters of triangles $A D X$ and $B D X$, respectively. Determine all points $X$ for which the area of triangle $O O_{1} O_{2}$ is minimized.\n\nWe prove $\\left[O O_{1} O_{2}\\right] \\geq \\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$, with equality if and only if $\\overline{C X} \\perp \\overline{A B}$.\n\u0414\u2018 First approach (Bobby Shen). We use two simultaneous inequalities:\n\n- Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $C X$ and $D X$. Then $M N$ equals the length of the $O$-altitude of $\\triangle O O_{1} O_{2}$, since $\\overline{O_{1} O_{2}}$ and $\\overline{D X}$ meet at $N$ at a right angle. Moreover, we have\n\n$$\nM N=\\frac{1}{2} C D \\geq \\frac{1}{2} h_{a}\n$$\nwhere $h_{a}$ denotes the $A$-altitude.\n- The projection of $O_{1} O_{2}$ onto line $A B$ has length exactly $A B / 2$. Thus\n$$\nO_{1} O_{2} \\geq \\frac{1}{2} A B\n$$\n\nSo, we find\n\n$$\n\\left[O O_{1} O_{2}\\right]=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot M N \\cdot O_{1} O_{2} \\geq \\frac{1}{8} h_{a} \\cdot A B=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C] .\n$$\n\nNote that equality occurs in both cases if and only if $\\overline{C X} \\perp \\overline{A B}$. So the area is minimized exactly when this occurs.\n\n\u0430\u00a4\u00ac Second approach (Evan's solution). We need two claims.\nClaim - We have $\\triangle O O_{1} O_{2} \\sim \\triangle C B A$, with opposite orientation.\n\nProof. Notice that $\\overline{O O_{1}} \\perp \\overline{A X}$ and $\\overline{O_{1} O_{2}} \\perp \\overline{C X}$, so $\\measuredangle O O_{1} O_{2}=\\measuredangle A X C=\\measuredangle A B C$. Similarly $\\measuredangle O O_{2} O_{1}=\\measuredangle B A C$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to minimizing $O_{1} O_{2}$.\n\n\nClaim (Salmon theorem) - We have $\\triangle X O_{1} O_{2} \\sim \\triangle X A B$.\n\nProof. It follows from the fact that $\\triangle A O_{1} X \\sim \\triangle B O_{2} X$ (since $\\measuredangle A D X=\\measuredangle X D B \\Longrightarrow$ $\\left.\\measuredangle X O_{1} A=\\measuredangle X O_{2} B\\right)$ and that spiral similarities come in pairs.\n\nLet $\\theta=\\angle A D X$. The ratio of similarity in the previous claim is equal to $\\frac{X O_{1}}{X A}=\\frac{1}{2 \\sin \\theta}$. In other words,\n\n$$\nO_{1} O_{2}=\\frac{A B}{2 \\sin \\theta}\n$$\n\nThis is minimized when $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, in which case $O_{1} O_{2}=A B / 2$ and $\\left[O O_{1} O_{2}\\right]=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$. This completes the solution.",

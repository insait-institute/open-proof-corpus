Assume for contradiction that $1$ is not shifty. Then for GCD reasons the set of shifty integers must be $d \\mathbb{Z}$ for some $d \\geq 2$.\n\nClaim - We have $S \\subseteq\\left\\{x: x^{2} \\equiv m(\\bmod d)\\right\\}$ for some fixed $m$.\nProof. Otherwise if we take any $p, q \\in S$ with distinct squares modulo $d$, then $q^{2}-p^{2} \\not \\equiv 0$ $(\\bmod d)$ is shifty, which is impossible.\n\nNow take $a, b \\in S$ as in (a). In that case we need to have\n\n$$\na^{2} \\equiv b^{2} \\equiv\\left(a^{2}-a\\right)^{2} \\equiv\\left(b^{2}-b\\right)^{2} \\quad(\\bmod d)\n$$\n\nPassing to a prime $p \\mid d$, we have the following:\n\n- Since $a^{2} \\equiv\\left(a^{2}-a\\right)^{2}(\\bmod p)$ or equivalently $a^{3}(a-2) \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$, either $a \\equiv 0$ $(\\bmod p)$ or $a \\equiv 2(\\bmod p)$.\n- Similarly, either $b \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$ or $b \\equiv 2(\\bmod p)$.\n- Since $a^{2} \\equiv b^{2}(\\bmod p)$, or $a \\equiv \\pm b(\\bmod p)$, we find either $a \\equiv b \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$ or $a \\equiv b \\equiv 2(\\bmod p)($ even if $p=2)$.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\nRemark. The condition (a) cannot be dropped, since otherwise we may take $S=\\{2(\\bmod p)\\}$ or $S=\\{0(\\bmod p)\\}$, say.",

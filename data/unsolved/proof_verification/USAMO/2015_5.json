We have $e^{5}=a^{4}+b^{4} \\leq a^{5}+b^{5}<(a c+b d)^{5}=p^{5}$.\nThus the above equation implies $p \\leq \\max \\left(a-d, a+d, a^{2}+d^{2}\\right)=a^{2}+d^{2}$. Similarly, $p \\leq b^{2}+c^{2}$. So\n\n$$\na c+b d=p \\leq \\min \\left\\{a^{2}+d^{2}, b^{2}+c^{2}\\right\\}\n$$\nor by subtraction\n$$\n0 \\leq \\min \\{a(a-c)+d(d-b), b(b-d)+c(c-a)\\}\n$$\n\nBut since $a^{4}+b^{4}=c^{4}+d^{4}$ the numbers $a-c$ and $d-b$ should have the same sign, and so this is an obvious contradiction.",

The exact value of $N$ is therefore very superficial. From playing with these concrete examples we find out we are essentially just trying to find an increasing set $S$ obeying\n\n$$\na_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}>a_{k+1}+\\cdots+a_{2 k}\n$$\nand indeed given a sequence satisfying these properties one simply sets $N=2\\left(a_{k+1}+\\cdots+a_{2 k}\\right)$. Therefore we can focus almost entirely on $a_{i}$ and not $N$.\n\nRemark. It is relatively straightforward to figure out what is going on based on the small cases. For example, one can work out by hand that\n\n- $\\{2,3,4\\}$ is optimal for $k=1$\n- $\\{5,6,7,8,9\\}$ is optimal for $k=2$,\n- $\\{10,11,12,13,14,15,16\\}$ is optimal for $k=3$.\n\nIn all the examples, the $a_{i}$ are an arithmetic progression of difference $1$, so that $a_{j}-a_{i} \\geq j-i$ is a sharp for all $i<j$, and thus this estimate may be used freely without loss of sharpness;\napplying it in $(\\star)$ gives a lower bound on $a_{0}$ which is then good enough to get a lower bound on $N$ matching the equality cases we found empirically.",

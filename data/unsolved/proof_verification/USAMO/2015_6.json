            "solution": "For brevity, $\\# S$ denotes $|S|$. Let $x_{n}=n \\lambda-\\# A_{n} \\geq 0$. We now proceed by contradiction by assuming the conclusion fails for $n$ large enough; that is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\lambda & <\\sum_{a \\in A_{n}} a \\\\\n& =1\\left(\\# A_{1}-\\# A_{0}\\right)+2\\left(\\# A_{2}-\\# A_{1}\\right)+\\cdots+n\\left(\\# A_{n}-\\# A_{n-1}\\right) \\\\\n& =n \\# A_{n}-\\left(\\# A_{1}+\\cdots+\\# A_{n-1}\\right) \\\\\n& =n\\left(n \\lambda-x_{n}\\right)-\\left[\\left(\\lambda-x_{1}\\right)+\\left(2 \\lambda-x_{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left((n-1) \\lambda-x_{n-1}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\lambda-n x_{n}+\\left(x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{n-1}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis means that for all sufficiently large $n$, say $n \\geq N_{0}$, we have\n\n$$\nx_{n}<\\frac{x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{n-1}}{n} \\quad \\forall n \\geq N_{0} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nIn particular, each $x_{n}$ is the less than the average of all preceding terms. Intuitively this means $x_{n}$ should become close to each other, since they are also nonnegative.\n\nHowever, we have a second condition we haven't used yet: the \"integer\" condition implies\n\n$$\n\\left|x_{n+1}-x_{n}\\right|=|\\lambda-\\#\\{n \\in A\\}|>\\varepsilon\n$$\nfor some fixed $\\varepsilon>0$, namely $\\varepsilon=\\min \\{\\lambda, 1-\\lambda\\}$. Using the fact that consecutive terms differ by some fixed $\\varepsilon$, we will derive a contradiction.\n\nIf we let $M$ be the average of $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N_{0}}$, then we ought to have\n\n$$\nx_{n}<M \\quad \\forall n>N_{0} .\n$$\n\nHence for $n>N_{0}$ we have $x_{n}+x_{n+1}<2 M-\\varepsilon$, and so for large enough $n$ the average must drop to just above $M-\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon$. Thus for some large $N_{1}>N_{0}$, we will have\n\n$$\nx_{n}<M-\\frac{1}{3} \\varepsilon \\quad \\forall n>N_{1} .\n$$\n\nIf we repeat this argument then with a large $N_{2}>N_{1}$, we obtain\n\n$$\nx_{n}<M-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon \\quad \\forall n>N_{2}\n$$\nand so on and so forth. This is a clear contradiction.\n\nRemark. Note that if $A=\\{2,2,3,4,5, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\lambda=1$ then contradiction. So the condition that $0<\\lambda<1$ cannot be dropped, and (by scaling) neither can the condition that $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nRemark (Suggested by Zhao Ting-wei). Despite the relation\n\n$$\nx_{n}<\\frac{x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{n-1}}{n} \\quad \\forall n \\geq N_{0}\n$$\nimplying that $x_{n}$ is bounded, it does not alone imply that $x_{n}$ converges, not even to some nonzero value. Zhao Ting-Wei showed me that one can have a sequence which is zero \"every so often\" yet where the average is nonzero.\n\nA counterexample is given explicitly by\n\n$$\nx_{n}= \\begin{cases}1000 & n=1 \\\\ 0 & n \\text { is a power of } 10 \\\\ 1+\\frac{1}{n} & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhich does not have a limit. For completeness, let's check this - let $H_{n}$ denote the $n$ 'th harmonic number, and compute\n\\$\\$\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\sum_{1}^{n-1} x_{n} \\& =1000+(n-1)+H_{n-1}-\\sum_{k=1}^{\\left\\lfloor\\log _{10} n\\right\\rfloor}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{10^{k}}\\right) <br>\n\\& >n+999+H_{n-1}-\\log _{10} n-\\left(1+\\frac{1}{10}+\u0412\u00b7\u0412\u00b7\u0412\u00b7\\right) <br>\n\\& >n+997+H_{n-1}-\\log _{10} n>n+1\n\n\\end{aligned}\\$\\$\nso $1+\\frac{1}{n}<\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{1}^{n-1} x_{n}$ as needed.",

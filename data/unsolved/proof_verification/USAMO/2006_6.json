Hence, we see that $M$ is the center of a spiral similarity taking $\\overline{A B}$ to $\\overline{E F}$, and consequently the circumcircles of $Q A B, Q E F, S A E, S B F$ concur at point $M$.\n\nIn other words, the Miquel point of $A B C D$ is also the Miquel point of $A B F E$. Similarly, $M$ is also the Miquel point of $E D C F$, so all four circles concur at $M$.",

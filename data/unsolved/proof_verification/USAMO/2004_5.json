Thus, any theorems that can be immediately found and have a Wikipedia article are allowed.</li></ul> The model has been specifically told that it should not skip steps or mark them as trivial. Any violation of this rule should be considered by assuming the model does not know how to derive the &quot;trivial&quot; step</p>",

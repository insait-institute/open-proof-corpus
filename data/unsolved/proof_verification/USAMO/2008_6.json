    "problem": "At a certain mathematical conference, every pair of mathematicians are either friends or strangers. At mealtime, every participant eats in one of two large dining rooms. Each mathematician insists upon eating in a room which contains an even number of his or her friends. Prove that the number of ways that the mathematicians may be split between the two rooms is a power of two (i.e., is of the form \\(2^{k}\\) for some positive integer \\(k\\)).",

            "solution": "Take the obvious graph interpretation where we are trying to 2-color a graph. Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of the graph over $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$, except the diagonal of $A \\operatorname{has} \\operatorname{deg} v(\\bmod 2)$ instead of zero. Then let $\\vec{d}$ be the main diagonal. Splittings then correspond to $A \\vec{v}=\\vec{d}$. It's then immediate that the number of ways is either zero or a power of two, since if it is nonempty it is a coset of $\\operatorname{ker} A$.\n\nThus we only need to show that:\n\n```\nClaim - At least one coloring exists.\n```\n\nProof. If not, consider a minimal counterexample G. Clearly there is at least one odd vertex $v$. Consider the graph with vertex set $G-v$, where all pairs of neighbors of $v$ have their edges complemented. By minimality, we have a good coloring here. One can check that this extends to a good coloring on $G$ by simply coloring $v$ with the color matching an even number of its neighbors. This breaks minimality of $G$, and hence all graphs $G$ have a coloring.\n\nIt's also possible to use linear algebra. We prove the following lemma:\n\n## Lemma (grobber)\n\nLet $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space, $T: V \\rightarrow V$ and $w \\in V$. Then $w$ is in the image of $T$ if and only if there are no $\\xi \\in V^{\\vee}$ for which $\\xi(w) \\neq 0$ and yet $\\xi \\circ T=0$.\n\nProof. Clearly if $T(v)=w$, then no $\\xi$ exists. Conversely, assume $w$ is not in the image of $T$. Then the image of $T$ is linearly independent from $w$. Take a basis $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{m}$ for the image of $T$, add $w$, and then extend it to a basis for all of $V$. Then have $\\xi$ kill all $e_{i}$ but not $w$.\n\n## Corollary\n\nIn a symmetric matrix $A \\bmod 2$, there exists a vector $v$ such that $A v$ is a copy of the diagonal of $A$.\n\nProof. Let $\\xi$ be such that $\\xi \\circ T=0$. Look at $\\xi$ as a column vector $w^{\\top}$, and let $d$ be the diagonal. Then\n\n$$\n0=w^{\\top} \\cdot T \\cdot w=\\xi(d)\n$$\nbecause this extracts the sum of coefficients submatrix of $T$, and all the symmetric entries cancel off. Thus no $\\xi$ as in the previous lemma exists.\n\nThis corollary gives the desired proof.",

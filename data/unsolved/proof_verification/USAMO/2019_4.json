Determine the number of ways to choose sets $S_{i j} \\subseteq\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 n\\}$, for all $0 \\leq i \\leq n$ and $0 \\leq j \\leq n$ (not necessarily distinct), such that\n\n- $\\left|S_{i j}\\right|=i+j$, and\n- $S_{i j} \\subseteq S_{k l}$ if $0 \\leq i \\leq k \\leq n$ and $0 \\leq j \\leq l \\leq n$.\n\nThe answer is $(2 n)!\\cdot 2^{n^{2}}$. First, we note that $\\varnothing=S_{00} \\subsetneq S_{01} \\subsetneq \\cdots \\subsetneq S_{n n}=\\{1, \\ldots, 2 n\\}$ and thus multiplying by $(2 n)$ ! we may as well assume $S_{0 i}=\\{1, \\ldots, i\\}$ and $S_{i n}=\\{1, \\ldots, n+i\\}$. We illustrate this situation by placing the sets in a grid, as below for $n=4$; our goal is to fill in the rest of the grid.\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1234 & 12345 & 123456 & 1234567 & 12345678 \\\\ 123 & & & & \\\\ 12 & & & & \\\\ 1 & & & & \\\\ \\varnothing & & & & \\end{array}\\right]$\n\nWe claim the number of ways to do so is $2^{n^{2}}$. In fact, more strongly even the partial fillings are given exactly by powers of $2$.\n\nClaim - Fix a choice $T$ of cells we wish to fill in, such that whenever a cell is in $T$, so are all the cells above and left of it. (In other words, $T$ is a Young tableau.) The number of ways to fill in these cells with sets satisfying the inclusion conditions is $2^{|T|}$ \u0433\u0402\u201a\n\nAn example is shown below, with an indeterminate set marked in red (and the rest of $T$ marked in blue).\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1234 & 12345 & 123456 & 1234567 & 12345678 \\\\ 123 & 1234 & 12346 & 123467 & \\\\ 12 & 124 & 1234 \\text { or } 1246 & & \\\\ 1 & 12 & & & \\\\ \\varnothing & 2 & & & \\end{array}\\right]$\n\nProof. The proof is by induction on $|T|$, with $|T|=0$ being vacuous.\nNow suppose we have a corner $\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}B & C \\\\ A & S\\end{array}\\right]$ where $A, B, C$ are fixed and $S$ is to be chosen. Then we may write $B=A \\cup\\{x\\}$ and $C=A \\cup\\{x, y\\}$ for $x, y \\notin A$. Then the two choices of $S$ are $A \\cup\\{x\\}$ (i.e. $B$ ) and $A \\cup\\{y\\}$, and both of them are seen to be valid.\n\nIn this way, we gain a factor of $2$ any time we add one cell as above to $T$. Since we can achieve any Young tableau in this way, the induction is complete.",

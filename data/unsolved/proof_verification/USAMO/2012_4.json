            "solution": "## Problem statement\n\nFind all functions $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(n!)=f(n)$ ! for all positive integers $n$ and such that $m-n$ divides $f(m)-f(n)$ for all distinct positive integers $m, n$.\n\nAnswer: $f \\equiv 1, f \\equiv 2$, and $f$ the identity. As these obviously work, we prove these are the only ones.\n\nBy putting $n=1$ and $n=2$ we give $f(1), f(2) \\in\\{1,2\\}$. Also, we will use the condition\n\n$$\nm!-n!\\text { divides } f(m)!-f(n)!.\n$$\n\nWe consider four cases on $f(1)$ and $f(2)$, and dispense with three of them.\n\n- If $f(2)=1$ then for all $m \\geq 3$ we have $m$ ! - $2$ divides $f(m)$ ! $-1$, so $f(m)=1$ for modulo $2$ reasons. Then clearly $f(1)=1$.\n- If $f(1)=f(2)=2$ we first obtain $3$ ! $-1 \\mid f(3)!-2$, which implies $f(3)=2$. Then $m!-3 \\mid f(m)$ ! $-2$ for $m \\geq 4$ implies $f(m)=2$ for modulo $3$ reasons.\n\nHence we are left with the case where $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=2$. Continuing, we have\n\n$$\n3!-1 \\mid f(3)!-1 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 3!-2 \\mid f(3)!-2 \\Longrightarrow f(3)=3\n$$\n\nContinuing by induction, suppose $f(1)=1, \\ldots, f(k)=k$.\n\n$$\nk!\\cdot k=(k+1)!-k!\\mid f(k+1)!-k!\n$$\nand thus we deduce that $f(k+1) \\geq k$, and hence\n$$\nk \\left\\lvert\\, \\frac{f(k+1)!}{k!}-1\\right.\n$$\n\nThen plainly $f(k+1) \\leq 2 k$ for $\\bmod k$ reasons, but also $f(k+1) \\equiv 1(\\bmod k)$ so we conclude $f(k+1)=k+1$.\n\nRemark. Shankar Padmanabhan gives the following way to finish after verifying that $f(3)=3$. Note that if\n\n$$\nM=((((3!)!)!)!\\ldots)!\n$$\nfor any number of iterated factorials then $f(M)=M$. Thus for any $n$, we have\n$$\nM-n|f(M)-f(n)=M-f(n) \\Longrightarrow M-n| n-f(n)\n$$\n\nand so taking $M$ large enough implies $f(n)=n$.",

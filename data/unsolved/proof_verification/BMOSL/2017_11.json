            "solution": "We show that the arithmetic mean in question is $\\frac{1}{2}$ for infinitely many primes congruent to $1$ modulo $4$.\nNotice that $\\left\\{\\frac{k^{2 n}}{p}\\right\\}=\\frac{r_{k}}{p}$, where $r_{k}$ is the remainder $k^{2 n}$ leaves upon division by $p$. Clearly, the $r_{k}$ are quadratic residues modulo $p$.\nIf $p$ is prime, and $p-1$ and $n$ are relatively prime, then the $r_{k}, k=1, \\ldots, \\frac{p-1}{2}$, are pairwise distinct, since the $k^{2 n}, k=1, \\ldots, \\frac{p-1}{2}$, are pairwise distinct modulo $p$, by Fermat's little theorem. In this case, the $r_{k}, k=1, \\ldots, \\frac{p-1}{2}$, form the set $R$ of all $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ quadratic residues modulo $p$ in the range $1$ through $p-1$.\nIf, in addition, $p$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, then $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$, and the assignment $r \\mapsto p-r, r \\in R$, defines a permutation of $R$. In this case,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{r \\in R} r=\\sum_{r \\in R}(p-r)=\\frac{p(p-1)}{2}-\\sum_{r \\in R} r\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\sum_{r \\in R} r=\\frac{p(p-1)}{4},\n$$\n\nand the arithmetic mean in question is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nFinally, since $n$ is odd, infinitely many primes congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ are also congruent to $2$ modulo $n$, by Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic sequences of integers; for such a prime $p$, the numbers $p-1$ and $n$ are clearly relatively prime. This completes the proof.",

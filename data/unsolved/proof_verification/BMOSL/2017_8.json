            "solution": "Let $p$ be a prime number. Then for $x=y=p$ the given condition gives us that the number $f^{2}(p)+3 p f(p)$ is a perfect square. Then, $f^{2}(p)+3 p f(p)=k^{2}$ for some positive integer $k$. Completing the square gives us that $(2 f(p)+3 p)^{2}-9 p^{2}=4 k^{2}$, or\n\n$$\n(2 f(p)+3 p-2 k)(2 f(p)+3 p+2 k)=9 p^{2} .\n$$\n\nSince $2 f(p)+3 p+3 k>3 p$, we have the following $4$ cases.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\{\\begin{array} { l } \n{ 2 f ( p ) + 3 p + 2 k = 9 p } \\\\\n{ 2 f ( p ) + 3 p - 2 k = p }\n\\end{array} \\text { or } \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n2 f(p)+3 p+2 k=p^{2} \\\\\n2 f(p)+3 p-2 k=9\n\\end{array}\\right.\\right. \\text { or } \\\\\n& \\left\\{\\begin{array} { l } \n{ 2 f ( p ) + 3 p + 2 k = 3 p ^ { 2 } } \\\\\n{ 2 f ( p ) + 3 p - 2 k = 3 }\n\\end{array} \\text { or } \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n2 f(p)+3 p+2 k=9 p^{2} \\\\\n2 f(p)+3 p-2 k=1\n\\end{array}\\right.\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving the systems, we have the following cases for $f(p)$.\n\n$$\nf(p)=p \\text { or } f(p)=\\left(\\frac{p-3}{2}\\right)^{2} \\text { or } f(p)=\\frac{3 p^{2}-6 p-3}{4} \\text { or } f(p)=\\left(\\frac{3 p-1}{2}\\right)^{2} .\n$$\n\nIn all cases, we see that $f(p)$ can be arbitrary large whenever $p$ grows.\nNow fix a positive integer $x$. From the given condition we have that\n\n$$\n(f(y)+x)^{2}+x f(x)-x^{2}\n$$\nis a perfect square. Since for $y$ being a prime, let $y=q, f(q)$ can be arbitrary large and $x f(x)-x^{2}$ is fixed, it means that $x f(x)-x^{2}$ should be zero, since the difference of $(f(q)+x+1)^{2}$ and $(f(q)+x)^{2}$ can be arbitrary large.\nAfter all, we conclude that $x f(x)=x^{2}$, so $f(x)=x$, which clearly satisfies the given condition.",

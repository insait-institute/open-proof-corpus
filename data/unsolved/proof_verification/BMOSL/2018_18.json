            "solution": "Answer: $(p, q)=(3,3)$.\nFor $p=2$ it is directly checked that there are no solutions. Assume that $p>2$.\nObserve that $N=11^{p}+17^{p} \\equiv 4(\\bmod 8)$, so $8 \\nmid 3 p^{q-1}+1>4$. Consider an odd prime divisor $r$ of $3 p^{q-1}+1$. Obviously, $r \\notin\\{3,11,17\\}$. There exists $b$ such that $17 b \\equiv 1$ $(\\bmod r)$. Then $r \\mid b^{p} N \\equiv a^{p}+1(\\bmod r)$, where $a=11 b$. Thus $r \\mid a^{2 p}-1$, but $r \\nmid a^{p}-1$, which means that $\\operatorname{ord}_{r}(a) \\mid 2 p$ and $\\operatorname{ord}_{r}(a) \\nmid p$, i.e. $\\operatorname{ord}_{r}(a) \\in\\{2,2 p\\}$.\nNote that if $\\operatorname{ord}_{r}(a)=2$, then $r \\mid a^{2}-1 \\equiv\\left(11^{2}-17^{2}\\right) b^{2}(\\bmod r)$, which gives $r=7$ as the only possibility. On the other hand, $\\operatorname{ord}_{r}(a)=2 p$ implies $2 p \\mid r-1$. Thus, all prime divisors of $3 p^{q-1}+1$ other than $2$ or $7$ are congruent to $1$ modulo $2 p$, i.e.\n\n$$\n3 p^{q-1}+1=2^{\\alpha} 7^{\\beta} p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}} \\cdots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}}\n$$\nwhere $p_{i} \\notin\\{2,7\\}$ are prime divisors with $p_{i} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 2 p)$.\nWe already know that $\\alpha \\leqslant 2$. Also, note that\n$$\n\\frac{11^{p}+17^{p}}{28}=11^{p-1}-11^{p-2} 17+11^{p-3} 17^{2}-\\cdots+17^{p-1} \\equiv p \\cdot 4^{p-1} \\quad(\\bmod 7)\n$$\n\nso $11^{p}+17^{p}$ is not divisible by $7^{2}$ and hence $\\beta \\leqslant 1$.\nIf $q=2$, then $(*)$ becomes $3 p+1=2^{\\alpha} 7^{\\beta} p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}} \\cdots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}}$, but $p_{i} \\geqslant 2 p+1$, which is only possible if $\\gamma_{i}=0$ for all $i$, i.e. $3 p+1=2^{\\alpha} 7^{\\beta} \\in\\{2,4,14,28\\}$, which gives us no solutions.\nThus $q>2$, which implies $4 \\mid 3 p^{q-1}+1$, i.e. $\\alpha=2$. Now the right hand side of $(*)$ is congruent to $4$ or $28$ modulo $p$, which gives us $p=3$. Consequently $3^{q}+1 \\mid 6244$, which is only possible for $q=3$. The pair $(p, q)=(3,3)$ is indeed a solution.",

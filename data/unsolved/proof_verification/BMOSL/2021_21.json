            "solution": "Solution 1. Let $N$ be the midpoint of $B S$ which, as $S A B T$ is a parallelogram, is also the midpoint of $T A$. Using $S T\\|A B\\| M P$ we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{N B}{B P}=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{S B}{B P}=\\frac{T B}{2 \\cdot B M}=\\frac{T B}{B C}\n$$\nwhich shows that $T A \\| C P$.\n\n\nLet $\\Omega$ be the circle with diameter $O T$. As $\\angle O M T=90^{\\circ}=\\angle T A O$ we have that $A, M$ lie on $\\Omega$. We now show that $P$ lies on $\\Omega$. As $T A \\| C P$ and $T A$ is tangent to $\\Gamma$ we have that $A P=A C$, so\n\n$$\n\\angle T A P=\\angle A C P=\\angle C P A=\\angle C B A=\\angle T M P\n$$\nwhere in the last step we used the fact that $M P \\| A B$. This shows that $P$ lies on $\\Omega$. Furthermore, this shows that $\\angle O P T=90^{\\circ}$ and so $T P$ is also tangent to $\\Gamma$.\n\nNow we show that $R, S$ lie on $\\Omega$ which would show that $\\Omega$ is the circumcircle of triangle $S T R$. For $S$, using $S T \\| A B$ and that $T A$ tangent to $\\Gamma$ we have\n\n$$\n\\angle T S P=\\angle A B S=\\angle A C P=\\angle T A P .\n$$\n\nFor $R$, the homothety with factor $2$ centred at $A$ takes $B N$ to $R T$. So $B N \\| R T$ and hence\n\n$$\n\\angle A R T=\\angle A B S=\\angle T A P=\\angle A P T,\n$$\nwhere the last step follows from $T A=T P$ as they are both tangents to $\\Gamma$.\nFinally, we observe that as $T A$ tangent to $\\Gamma$ then\n$$\n\\angle T A C=180^{\\circ}-\\angle C B A=\\angle A B T=\\angle T S A\n$$\n\nwhich, by the alternate segment theorem, means that line $A C$ is tangent to $\\Omega$ as required.\n\nSolution 2. We have\n\n$$\n\\angle A P S=\\angle A C B=\\angle T A B=\\angle A T S,\n$$\nso $S, A, P, T$ are concyclic on a circle $\\Omega$. We also have\n$$\n\\angle P A C=\\angle P B C=\\angle S B T=\\angle P S A\n$$\n\nso $A C$ is tangent to $\\Omega$. It remains to prove that $R$ belongs on $\\Omega$.\n\n\nAs in Solution $1$ we have that $T A \\| C P$. Then\n\n$$\n\\angle C P M=\\angle A T S=\\angle A P S .\n$$\n\nSince also $\\angle B A P=\\angle B C P$, then the triangles $A P B$ and $C P M$ are similar. But then the triangles $B P C$ and $R A P$ are also similar as $\\angle R A P=\\angle B C P$ and\n\n$$\n\\frac{R A}{A P}=\\frac{2 B A}{A P}=\\frac{2 M C}{C P}=\\frac{B C}{C P} .\n$$\n\nIt now follows that\n\n$$\n\\angle A R P=\\angle P B C=\\angle A S P\n$$\nand therefore $R$ belongs to $\\Omega$ as required.",

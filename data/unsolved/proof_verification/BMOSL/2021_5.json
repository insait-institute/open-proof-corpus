We will prove the following:\nClaim: Assume $a_{n}=p_{i} p_{i+1}$. Then for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, p_{i+2}-p_{i}$ we have that $a_{n+k}=$ $\\left(p_{i}+k\\right) p_{i+1}$.\nProof. By induction on $k$. Since $\\ell\\left(a_{n}\\right)=p_{i+1}$, then $a_{n+1}=p_{i} p_{i+1}+p_{i+1}=\\left(p_{i}+1\\right) p_{i+1}$. Assume now that $a_{n+r}=\\left(p_{i}+r\\right) p_{i+1}$ for some $r<p_{i+2}-p_{i}$. For the inductive step, it is enough to show that $\\ell\\left(a_{n+r}\\right)=p_{i+1}$ as then we would have $a_{n+r}=\\left(p_{i}+r\\right) p_{i+1}+p_{i+1}=\\left(p_{i}+r+1\\right) p_{i+1}$. Assume for contradiction that $\\ell\\left(a_{n+r}\\right) \\neq p_{i+1}$. Since $p_{i+1} \\mid a_{n+r}$, then we must have that $\\ell\\left(a_{n+r}\\right)>p_{i+1}$. Since also $a_{n+r}=\\left(p_{i}+r\\right) p_{i+1}$, then $\\ell\\left(p_{i}+r\\right)>p_{i+1}$ and therefore $\\ell\\left(p_{i}+r\\right) \\geqslant p_{i+2}$. This is impossible as $p_{i}+r<p_{i+2}$.\n\nSince $a_{1}=2, a_{2}=4, a_{3}=6=2 \\cdot 3=p_{1} p_{2}$, from the above claim, by induction, we can break up the sequence into pieces of the form $p_{i} p_{i+1},\\left(p_{i}+1\\right) p_{i+1}, \\ldots, p_{i+2} p_{i+1}$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots$, together with the initial piece $2,4$.\n\nWe immediately see that for each prime $p$, the number $p^{2}$ appears in the sequence. It remains to show that no other square number appears in the sequence.\nAssume for contradiction that another square appears in $p_{i} p_{i+1},\\left(p_{i}+1\\right) p_{i+1}, \\ldots, p_{i+2} p_{i+1}$ for some $i$. Since all elements of this piece are multiples of $p_{i+1}$, if a square appears in this sequence, it must be a multiple of $p_{i+1}^{2}$. So the smallest possible square different from $p_{i+1}^{2}$ is $4 p_{i+1}^{2}$. It is enough to show that $4 p_{i+1}^{2}>p_{i+2} p_{i+1}$. This is equivalent to showing that $p_{i+2}<4 p_{i+1}$ which follows from Bertrand's postulate.",

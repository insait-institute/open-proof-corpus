Since $k>0$, we obtain that $k \\geq 3$.\n\nWe have $b c \\geq c a \\geq a b$, so from the above relation we deduce that $b c \\geq 1$.\nBy AM-GM, $b+c \\geq 2 \\sqrt{b c}$ and consequently $b+c \\geq 2$. The equality holds iff $b=c$.\nThe constraint gives us\n\n$$\na=\\frac{b+c-b c}{b+c-1}=1-\\frac{b c-1}{b+c-1} \\geq 1-\\frac{b c-1}{2 \\sqrt{b c}-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{b c}(2-\\sqrt{b c})}{2 \\sqrt{b c}-1}\n$$\n\nFor $\\sqrt{b c}=2$ condition $a \\geq 0$ gives $\\sqrt{b c}(a+1) \\geq 2$ with equality iff $a=0$ and $b=c=2$.\nFor $\\sqrt{b c}<2$, taking into account the estimation for $a$, we get\n\n$$\na \\sqrt{b c} \\geq \\frac{b c(2-\\sqrt{b c})}{2 \\sqrt{b c}-1}=\\frac{b c}{2 \\sqrt{b c}-1}(2-\\sqrt{b c}) .\n$$\n\nSince $\\frac{b c}{2 \\sqrt{b c}-1} \\geq 1$, with equality for $b c=1$, we get $\\sqrt{b c}(a+1) \\geq 2$ with equality iff $a=b=c=1$.\n\nFor $\\sqrt{b c}>2$ we have $\\sqrt{b c}(a+1)>2(a+1) \\geq 2$.\nThe proof is complete.\nThe equality holds iff $a=b=c=1$ or $a=0$ and $b=c=2$.",

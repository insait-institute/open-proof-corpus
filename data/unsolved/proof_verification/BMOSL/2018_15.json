    "problem": "In a triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(AB = AC\\), \\(\\omega\\) is the circumcircle and \\(O\\) its center. Let \\(D\\) be a point on the extension of \\(BA\\) beyond \\(A\\). The circumcircle \\(\\omega_1\\) of triangle \\(OAD\\) intersects the line \\(AC\\) and the circle \\(\\omega\\) again at points \\(E\\) and \\(G\\), respectively. Point \\(H\\) is such that \\(DAEH\\) is a parallelogram. Line \\(EH\\) meets circle \\(\\omega_1\\) again at point \\(J\\). The line through \\(G\\) perpendicular to \\(GB\\) meets \\(\\omega_1\\) again at point \\(N\\) and the line through \\(G\\) perpendicular to \\(GJ\\) meets \\(\\omega\\) again at point \\(L\\).

            "solution": "We first observe that $\\varangle D O E=\\varangle D A E=2 \\varangle A B C=\\varangle B O A$ and hence $\\varangle D O B=$ $\\varangle E O A$, which together with $O B=O A$ and $\\varangle O B D=\\varangle B A O=\\varangle O A E$ gives us $\\triangle O B D \\cong \\triangle O A E$. Therefore $B D=A E$.\nNext, $O G=O A$ implies $\\varangle O D G=\\varangle O D A=\\varangle O D B$ and hence $\\triangle O G D \\cong \\triangle O B D$. It follows that $D G=D B=A E=D H$. Moreover, since $A D \\| E J$, we have $D J=A E=$ $D G$. Thus, the points $B, G, H, J$ lie on a circle $\\omega_{2}$ with center $D$.\nWe deduce that $\\varangle A G H=\\varangle B G H-\\varangle B G A=180^{\\circ}-\\frac{1}{2} \\varangle H D B-\\varangle B C A=180^{\\circ}-$ $\\frac{1}{2} \\varangle C A B-\\varangle B C A=90^{\\circ}$.\nWe will now invert the diagram through $G$. By $\\hat{X}$ we denote the image of any point $X$. The points $\\hat{H}, \\hat{L}, \\hat{N}$ then lie on the lines $\\hat{B} \\hat{J}, \\hat{A} \\hat{B}$ and $\\hat{A} \\hat{J}$, respectively, such that $\\varangle \\hat{A} G \\hat{H}=\\hat{B} G \\hat{N}=\\varangle \\hat{J} G \\hat{L}=90^{\\circ}$. It remains to prove that $\\hat{H}, \\hat{L}$ and $\\hat{N}$ are collinear, which follows from the following statement:\n\n\nLemma. Let $X Y Z$ be a triangle and let $U$ be a point in the plane. If the lines through $U$ perpendicular to $U X, U Y, U Z$ meet the lines $Y Z, Z X, X Y$ respectively at points $P, Q, R$, then the points $P, Q$ and $R$ are collinear.\n$\\underline{\\text { Proof. Here we assume that } U \\text { is inside } \\triangle X Y Z \\text { and the angles } X U Y, Y U Z \\text { and } Z U X . . . ~}$ are all obtuse - the other cases are similar. We have\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\overrightarrow{Y P}}{\\overrightarrow{P Z}}=-\\frac{P_{Y U P}}{P_{P U Z}}, \\quad \\frac{\\overrightarrow{Z Q}}{\\overrightarrow{Q X}}=-\\frac{P_{Z U Q}}{P_{Q U X}}, \\quad \\frac{\\overrightarrow{X R}}{\\overrightarrow{R Y}}=-\\frac{P_{X U R}}{P_{R U Y}}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, since $\\varangle Q U X=\\varangle Y U P$ are equal and equally directed, we have $\\frac{P_{Y U P}}{P_{Q U X}}=\\frac{U P \\cdot U Y}{U Q \\cdot U X}$. Writing the analogous expressions for $\\frac{P_{Z U Q}}{P_{R U Y}}$ and $\\frac{P_{X U R}}{P_{P U Z}}$\nand multiplying them out we obtain $\\frac{\\overrightarrow{Y P}}{\\overrightarrow{P Z}} \\cdot \\frac{\\overrightarrow{Z Q}}{\\overrightarrow{Q X}} \\cdot \\frac{\\overrightarrow{X R}}{\\overrightarrow{R Y}}=-1$, and the result follows by Menelaus' theorem.",

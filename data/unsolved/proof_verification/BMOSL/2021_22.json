This is possible as the equation $x^{2}-u x+1$ for $u \\geqslant 2$ has two positive real solutions. (Discriminant is $u^{2}-4 \\geqslant 0$, sum and product of solutions are positive.) Now taking $x=\\sqrt{a}, y=\\sqrt{b}$ we get $f(u)=g(1)$. Now given any $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$, taking $x=t / 2, y=2$ we have\n\n$$\ng(t)=f\\left(\\frac{t^{2}}{4}+4\\right)=g(1)\n$$\nas $\\frac{t^{2}}{4}+4 \\geqslant 2$. So $g$ is constant. But since any real number can be written as a sum of two squares, then $f$ is constant as well. So there is a $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)=c$ and $g(x)=c$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Obviosuly any such pair of functions satisfies the equation.",

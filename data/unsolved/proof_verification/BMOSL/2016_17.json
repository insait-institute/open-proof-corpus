We directly check the identity\n\n$$\n(x+y+z)^{5}-(-x+y+z)^{5}-(x-y+z)^{5}-(x+y-z)^{5}=80 x y z\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, if integers $x, y$ and $z$ satisfy the equation from the statement, we then have\n\n$$\n(-x+y+z)^{5}+(x-y+z)^{5}+(x+y-z)^{5}=0\n$$\n\nBy Fermat's theorem at least one of the parenthesis equals $0$. Let, w.l.o.g., $x=y+z$. Then the previous equation reduces to $(2 z)^{5}+(2 y)^{5}=0$, which is equivalent to $y=-z$. Therefore, the solution set of the proposed equation is\n\n$$\n(x, y, z) \\in\\{(0, t,-t),(t, 0,-t),(t,-t, 0): t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\n$$\n\nRemark(PSC): Due to the volume of calculations that are involved in the solution of this problem, a more simplified version can be:\n\nFind all the integer solutions $(x, y, z)$ of the equation\n\n$$\n(x+y+z)^{3}=24 x y z\n$$\n\nThe solution would be similar to the one proposed in the original problem using the identity\n\n$$\n(x+y+z)^{3}-(-x+y+z)^{3}-(x-y+z)^{3}-(x+y-z)^{3}=24 x y z\n$$",

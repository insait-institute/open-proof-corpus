We will prove that $k_{\\max }=45$.\nWe number the columns and the rows and we select all possible $3^{2}=9$ choices of an odd column with an odd row.\n\nCollecting all such pairs of an odd column with an odd row, we double count some squares. Indeed, we take some $3^{2}$ squares $5$ times, some $12$ squares $3$ times and there are some $4$ squares (namely all the intersections of an even column with an even row) that we don't take in such pairs.\n\nIt follows that the maximal total sum over all $3^{2}$ choices of an odd column with an odd row is\n\n$$\n5 \\times(17+18+\\cdots+25)+3 \\times(5+6+\\cdots+16)=1323\n$$\n\nSo, by an averaging argument, there exists a pair of an odd column with an odd row with sum at most $\\frac{1323}{9}=147$.\n\nThen all the other squares of the array will have sum at least\n\n$$\n(1+2+\\cdots+25)-147=178\n$$\n\nBut for these squares there is a tiling with $2 \\times 2$ arrays, which are $4$ in total. So there is an $2 \\times 2$ array, whose numbers have a sum at least $\\frac{178}{4}>44$. So, there is a $2 \\times 2$ array whose numbers have a sum at least $45$. This argument gives that\n\n$$\nk_{\\max } \\geq 45 .\n$$\n\nWe are going now to give an example of an array, in which $45$ is the best possible. We fill the rows of the array as follows:\n\n| $25$ | $5$ | $24$ | $6$ | $23$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $11$ | $4$ | $12$ | $3$ | $13$ |\n| $22$ | $7$ | $21$ | $8$ | $20$ |\n| $14$ | $2$ | $15$ | $1$ | $16$ |\n| $19$ | $9$ | $18$ | $10$ | $17$ |\n\nWe are going now to even rows:\nIn the above array, every $2 \\times 2$ subarray has a sum, which is less or equal to $45$. This gives that\n\n$$\nk_{\\max } \\leq 45 .\n$$\n\nA combination of (1) and (2) gives that $k_{\\max }=45$.",

            "solution": "Solution. We write $p=|a-b|$ and assume for contradiction that $q=(a+b)^{2}+4$ is a prime number.\n\nSince $(a, b) \\mid[a, b]$, we have that $(a, b) \\mid 2021^{c}$. As $(a, b)$ also divides $p=|a-b|$, it follows that $(a, b) \\in\\{1,43,47\\}$. We will consider all $3$ cases separately:\n(1) If $(a, b)=1$, then $1+a b=2021^{c}$, and therefore\n\n$$\nq=(a+b)^{2}+4=(a-b)^{2}+4(1+a b)=p^{2}+4 \\cdot 2021^{c} .\n$$\n(a) Suppose $c$ is even. Since $q \\equiv 1 \\bmod 4$, it can be represented uniquely (up to order) as a sum of two (non-negative) squares. But (1) gives potentially two such representations so in order to have uniqueness we must have $p=2$. But then $4 \\mid q$ a contradiction.\n(b) If $c$ is odd then $a b=2021^{c}-1 \\equiv 1 \\bmod 3$. Thus $a \\equiv b \\bmod 3$ implying that $p=|a-b| \\equiv 0 \\bmod 3$. Therefore $p=3$. Without loss of generality $b=a+3$. Then $2021^{c}=a b+1=a^{2}+3 a+1$ and so\n$$\n(2 a+3)^{2}=4 a^{2}+12 a+9=4 \\cdot 2021^{c}+5 .\n$$\n\nSo $5$ is a quadratic residue modulo $47$, a contradiction as\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5}{47}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{47}{5}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)=-1 .\n$$\n(2) If $(a, b)=43$, then $p=|a-b|=43$ and we may assume that $a=43 k$ and $b=43(k+1)$, for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then $2021^{c}=43+43 k(k+1)$ giving that\n$$\n(2 k+1)^{2}=4 k^{2}+4 k+4-3=4 \\cdot 43^{c-1} \\cdot 47-3 .\n$$\n\nSo $-3$ is a quadratic residue modulo $47$, a contradiction as\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{-3}{47}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{-1}{47}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{47}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{47}{3}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=-1 .\n$$\n(3) If $(a, b)=47$ then analogously there is a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that\n$$\n(2 k+1)^{2}=4 \\cdot 43^{c} \\cdot 47^{c-1}-3\n$$\n\nIf $c>1$ then we get a contradiction in exactly the same way as in (2). If $c=1$ then $(2 k+1)^{2}=169$ giving $k=6$. This implies that $a+b=47 \\cdot 6+47 \\cdot 7=47 \\cdot 13 \\equiv 1 \\bmod 5$. Thus $q=(a+b)^{2}+4 \\equiv 0 \\bmod 5$, a contradiction.",

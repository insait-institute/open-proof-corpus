            "solution": "Solution. As $D C$ is tangent to $k$ at $C$ then $\\angle O C D=90^{\\circ}$. Denote by $X$ the midpoint of $A B$. Then $\\angle O X A=90^{\\circ}$ because of $O X$ is the perpendicular bisector of the side $A B$. The pentagon $P X O C D$ is inscribed in the circle with diameter $O D$, hence $\\angle P X A=$ $\\angle P X D=\\angle P C D=\\angle Q C D=\\angle Q B A$ (the latter is due to $Q B C D$ being cyclic). We deduce that $P X \\| Q B$ and that $P$ is the midpoint of $A Q$, so $A P=P Q$.\n\nFigure 5: G5\nNow let $T_{1}$ be the midpoint of the arc $B Q$, not containing $K$, from the circumcircle of $\\triangle B K Q$, then $T_{1} B=T_{1} Q$. Due to $\\angle D P O=90^{\\circ}$, it suffices to show that $\\angle O P T_{1}=90^{\\circ}$ - indeed, $T \\equiv T_{1}$ and $T B=T Q$ would follow.\n\nDenote by $Y$ the midpoint of $B Q$. Then $\\angle O X B=\\angle T_{1} Y B=90^{\\circ}$. The quadrilateral $Q K B T_{1}$ is inscribed in a circle, hence $\\angle B T_{1} Q=180-\\angle B K Q=\\angle A K B$. Then $\\angle X B O=$ $\\frac{1}{2} \\angle A K B=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle B T_{1} Q=\\angle B T_{1} Y$ and thus $\\triangle O X B \\sim \\triangle B Y T_{1}$. The quadrilaterals $P X B Y$\nand $A X Y P$ are paralellograms, since $X Y$ and $P Y$ are middle lines of the triangle $A Q B$. Consequently,\n\n$$\n\\frac{O X}{X P}=\\frac{O X}{B Y}=\\frac{X B}{T_{1} Y}=\\frac{P Y}{T_{1} Y}\n$$\nwhich along with $\\angle P X B=\\angle P Y B$ and $\\angle O X B=\\angle T_{1} Y B$ gives $\\angle O X P=\\angle P Y T_{1}$ and $\\triangle O X P \\sim \\triangle P Y T_{1}$. Thus $\\angle X P O=\\angle Y T_{1} P$ and $\\angle P O X=\\angle T_{1} P Y$.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\n$$\n\\angle O P T_{1}=\\angle X P Y+\\angle X P O+\\angle Y P T_{1}=\\angle P X A+\\angle X P O+\\angle X O P=90^{\\circ}\n$$",

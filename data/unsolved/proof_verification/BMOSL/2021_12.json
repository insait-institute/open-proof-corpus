The answer is $n=\\left\\lfloor\\log _{K+1} N\\right\\rfloor$.\nNote first that for $n \\leqslant\\left\\lfloor\\log _{K+1} N\\right\\rfloor$, taking $a_{i}=(K+1)^{i-1}$ works. Indeed let $r$ be maximal such that $m_{r} \\neq 0$. Then on the one hand we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} a_{i}\\right| \\leqslant \\sum_{i=1}^{n} K(K+1)^{i-1}=(K+1)^{n}-1<N\n$$\n\nOn the other hand we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} a_{i}\\right| \\geqslant\\left|m_{r} a_{r}\\right|-\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{r-1} m_{i} a_{i}\\right| \\geqslant(K+1)^{r-1}-\\sum_{i=1}^{r-1} K(K+1)^{i-1}=1>0\n$$\n\nSo the sum is indeed not divisible by $n$.\nAssume now that $n \\geqslant\\left\\lfloor\\log _{K+1} N\\right\\rfloor$ and look at all $n$-tuples of the form $\\left(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{n}\\right)$ where each $t_{i}$ is a non-negative integer with $t_{i} \\leqslant K$. There are $(K+1)^{n}>N$ such tuples so there are two of them, say $\\left(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{n}\\right)$ and $\\left(t_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, t_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i} a_{i} \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i}^{\\prime} a_{i} \\bmod N\n$$\n\nNow taking $m_{i}=t_{i}-t_{i}^{\\prime}$ for each $i$ satisfies the requirements on the $m_{i}$ 's but $N$ divides the sum\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} a_{i}\n$$\na contradiction.",

Combining these equations in the form $2 E_{1}-E_{2}+E_{3}+E_{4}$ the left hand side vanishes, yielding an equation in $g:(g(a+x)+g(a-x)-2 g(a)) x^{2}=0$, i.e.\n\n$$\ng(a)=\\frac{g(a+x)+g(a-x)}{2}\n$$\n\nSince $g$ is continuous, it must be linear, i.e. $g(x)=c_{1} x+c_{0}$. However, the original equation for $x=y$ together with the concavity condition now gives us\n\n$$\n0 \\geqslant f(2 x)+f(0)-2 f(x)=\\left(x c_{1}+c_{0}\\right) x^{2}\n$$\nfor all $x$, which is only possible if $c_{1}=0$. Thus $g(x) \\equiv c_{0}=2 A$ is constant and\n$$\nf(x+y)+f(x-y)-2 f(x)=2 A y^{2}\n$$\n\nThis suggests that $f$ is a quadratic function, so we can set $f(x)=A x^{2}+f_{1}(x)$. Then $(*)$ becomes $f_{1}(x+y)+f_{1}(x-y)-2 f_{1}(x)=0$, so an easy induction gives us\n\n$$\nf_{1}(n x)-f_{1}(0)=n\\left(f_{1}(x)-f_{1}(0)\\right) \\quad \\text { for all } \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nBy setting $f_{1}(0)=C$ and $f_{1}(1)=B+C$ we obtain $f_{1}(x)=B x+C$ and $f(x)=$ $A x^{2}+B x+C$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. By concavity of $f$ we conclude that $f(x)=A x^{2}+B x+C$ for all real $x$.",

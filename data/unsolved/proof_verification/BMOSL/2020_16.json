Begin by letting the $x$ 's be all equal to $n$ to infer that $f(n)$ ! is divisible by $n$ !, so $f(n) \\geqslant n$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\nClaim. $f(p-1)=p-1$ for all but finitely many primes $p$.\nAssume the Claim for the moment to proceed as follows: Fix any positive integer $n$, and let $p$ be a large enough prime, e. g., $p>f(n)!-n$. Then let one of the $x$ 's be equal to $1$ and the remaining $k-1$ be all equal to $p-1$, and use the Claim to infer that the number\n\n$$\n(f(n)!-n!)+(n!+(k-1)(p-1)!)=f(n)!+(k-1) f(p-1)!\n$$\nis divisible by $n!+(k-1)(p-1)$ !, and hence so is $f(n)!-n$ !. Since $p$ is large enough, this forces $f(n)!=n!$, and since $f(n) \\geqslant n$, it follows that $f(n)=n$, as desired.\nProof of the Claim. If $k$ is even, let $p>f(1)!$, and let half of the $x$ 's be all equal to $1$ and the other half be all equal to $p-1$, to infer that $f(p-1)!+f(1)$ ! is divisible by $(p-1)!+1$. By Wilson's theorem, the latter is divisible by $p$, and hence so is the former. Since $p>f(1)$ !, the number $f(1)$ ! is not divisible by $p$, so $f(p-1)$ ! is not divisible by $p$ either, forcing $f(p-1) \\leqslant p-1$. Recall now that $f(p-1) \\geqslant p-1$, to conclude that $f(p-1)=p-1$.\n\nIf $k$ is odd, let $p>f(2)!+\\frac{1}{2}(k-3) f(1)$ !, let $\\frac{1}{2}(k+1)$ of the $x$ 's be all equal to $p-1$, let one of the $x$ 's be equal to $2$, and let the remaining ones (if any) be all equal to $1$, to infer that $\\frac{1}{2}(k+1) f(p-1)!+f(2)!+\\frac{1}{2}(k-3) f(1)!$ is divisible by $\\frac{1}{2}(k+1)(p-1)!+2+\\frac{1}{2}(k-3)=$ $\\frac{1}{2}(k+1)((p-1)!+1)$. By Wilson's theorem, the latter is divisible by $p$, and hence so is the former. Since $p>f(2)!+\\frac{1}{2}(k-3) f(1)$ !, the number $f(2)!+\\frac{1}{2}(k-3) f(1)!$ is not divisible by $p$, so $\\frac{1}{2}(k+1) f(p-1)$ ! is not divisible by $p$ either, forcing $f(p-1) \\leqslant p-1$. Recall again that $f(p-1) \\geqslant p-1$, to conclude that $f(p-1)=p-1$.",

            "solution": "We will consider $2$ cases, whether the range of the functions is infinite or finite or in other words the function take infinite or finite values.\nCase 1. The Function has an infinite range. Let's fix a random natural number $n$ and let $m$ be any natural number. Then using (1) we have\n\n$$\nn+f(m)\\left|f(n)+n f(m)=f(n)-n^{2}+n(f(m)+n) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n+f(m)\\right| f(n)-n^{2}\n$$\n\nSince $n$ is a fixed natural number, then $f(n)-n^{2}$ is as well a fixed natural number, and since the above results is true for any $m$ and the function $f$ has an infinite range, we can choose $m$ such that $n+f(m)>\\left|f(n)-n^{2}\\right|$. This implies that $f(n)=n^{2}$ for any natural number $n$. We now check that it is a solution. Since\n\n$$\nn+f(m)=n+m^{2}\n$$\nand\n$$\nf(n)+n f(m)=n^{2}+n m^{2}=n\\left(n+m^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nit is straightforward that $n+f(m) \\mid f(n)+n f(m)$\nCase 2. The Function has a finite range. Since the function takes finite values, then it exists a natural number $k$ such that $\\mathrm{I} \\leq f(n) \\leq k$ for any natural number $n$. It is clear that it exists at least one natural number $s$ (where $1 \\leq s \\leq k$ ) such that $f(n)=s$ for infinite natural numbers $n$. Let $m, n$ be any natural numbers such that $f(m)=f(n)=s$. Using (1) we have\n\n$$\nn+s\\left|s+n s=s-s^{2}+s(n+s) \\Rightarrow n+s\\right| s^{2}-s\n$$\n\nSince this is true for any natural number $n$ such that $f(n)=s$ and since exist infinite natural numbers $n$ such that $f(n)=s$, we can choose the natural number $n$ such that $n+s>s^{2}-s$, which implies that $s^{2}=s \\Rightarrow s=1$, or in other words $f(n)=1$ for an infinite natural number n\nLet's fix a random natural number $m$ and let $n$ be any natural number $f(n)=1$. Then using (1) we have\n\n$$\nn+f(m)\\left|1+n f(m)=1-(f(m))^{2}+f(m)(n+f(m)) \\Rightarrow n+f(m)\\right|(f(m))^{2}-1\n$$\n\nSince $m$ is a fixed a random natural number, then $(f(m))^{2}-1$ is a fixed non-negative integer and since $n$ is any natural nummber such that $f(n)=1$ and since exist infinite numbers $n$ such that $f(n)=1$, we can choose the the natural number $n$ such that $n+f(m)>(f(m))^{2}-1$. This implies $f(m)=1$ for any natural number $m$. We now check that it is a solution. Since\n\n$$\nn+f(m)=n+1\n$$\nand\n$$\nf(n)+n f(m)=1+n\n$$\n\nit is straightforward that $n+f(m) \\mid f(n)+n f(m)$.\nSo, all the functions that satisfy the given condition are $f(n)=n^{2}$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ or $f(n)=1$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.",

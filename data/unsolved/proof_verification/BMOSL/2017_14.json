            "solution": "We will prove first that the circle $c_{1}$ is tangent to $A B$ at the point $B$. In order to prove this, we have to prove that $\\measuredangle B D C=\\measuredangle A B C$. Indeed, since $B D \\| A C$, we have that $\\measuredangle D B C=\\measuredangle A C B$. Additionally, $\\angle B C D=\\measuredangle B A C$ (by chord and tangent), which means that the triangles $A B C, B D C$ have two equal angles and so the third ones are also equal. It follows that $\\angle B D C=\\measuredangle A B C$, so $c_{1}$ is tangent to $A B$ at the point $B$.\n\nSimilarly, the circle $c_{2}$ is tangent to $A C$ at the point $C$.\nAs a consequence, $\\measuredangle A B T=\\measuredangle A C B$ (by chord and tangent) and also $\\measuredangle B S C=\\measuredangle A C B$.\nBy the above, we have that $\\measuredangle A B T=\\measuredangle B S C$, so the lines $B T, S C$ are parallel.\nNow, let $S T$ intersect $B C$ at the point $K$. It suffice to prove that $K$ belongs to $A L$. From the trapezoid $B T C S$ we get that\n\n$$\n\\frac{B K}{K C}=\\frac{B T}{S C}\n$$\nand from the similar triangles $A B T, A S C$, we have that\n$$\n\\frac{B T}{S C}=\\frac{A B}{A S}\n$$\n\nBy (1), (2) we get that\n\n$$\n\\frac{B K}{K C}=\\frac{A B}{A S}\n$$\n\nFrom the power of point theorem, we have that\n\n$$\nA C^{2}=A B \\cdot A S \\Rightarrow A S=\\frac{A C^{2}}{A B}\n$$\n\nGoing back into (3), it gives that\n\n$$\n\\frac{B K}{K C}=\\frac{A B^{2}}{A C^{2}}\n$$\n\nFrom the last one, it follows that $K$ belongs to the symmedian of the triangle $A B C$.\nFinally, recall that the well known fact that since $L B$ and $L C$ are tangents, it follows that $A L$ is the symmedian of the triangle $A B C$, so $K$ belongs to $A L$, as needed.",

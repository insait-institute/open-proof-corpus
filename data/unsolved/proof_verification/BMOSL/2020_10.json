            "solution": "Solution. Let $L^{\\prime}$ be the midpoint of $A H$. Then we claim $L^{\\prime}$ lies on $\\odot A B C$.\n\nIndeed, let $D$ be the foot of the $A$-altitude on $B C$. Then:\n\n$$\nA G=G H \\Rightarrow \\angle G L^{\\prime} A=90^{\\circ} \\Rightarrow G L^{\\prime} \\| B C \\Rightarrow D L^{\\prime}=\\frac{A L^{\\prime}}{2}=\\frac{H L^{\\prime}}{2} \\Rightarrow D L^{\\prime}=H D\n$$\nwhere in the last step we have used that if $M$ is the midpoint of $B C, A G: G M=2: 1$ and that $\\angle B$ is obtuse so $H, A$ lie on opposite sides of line $B C$. This means that $L^{\\prime}$ is the reflection of $H$ in $B C$, which is well-known to lie on $\\odot A B C$. Also $A G=G H \\Rightarrow$ $\\angle G L^{\\prime} A=90^{\\circ}$ so $L^{\\prime}$ lies on $\\omega$ and hence in fact $L \\equiv L^{\\prime}$.\n\nLet $O$ be the midpoint of $A G$; then $O L \\perp L K$. Homothety of factor $2$ at $A$ takes $O L \\rightarrow H G$ so $H G \\| O L$ and hence $L K \\perp H G$. But the centre of $\\odot A B C$ lies on $H G$ so this means $K$ is the reflection of $L$ across line $H G$ and hence as $\\angle H L G=90^{\\circ}$ it follows $\\angle H K G=90^{\\circ}$.\n\nRemark. The midpoint of $A H$ lies on the circumcircle of $\\odot A B C$ iff $\\angle A=90^{\\circ}$ or if:\n\n$$\na^{4}+a^{2}\\left(b^{2}+c^{2}\\right)-2\\left(b^{2}-c^{2}\\right)^{2}=0\n$$\n\nThe latter condition is exactly equivalent to $A G=G H$.",

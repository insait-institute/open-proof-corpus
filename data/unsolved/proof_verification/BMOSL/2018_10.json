Note that $M$ lies outside the circles $A B D$ and $A C E$ because $\\varangle A D B+\\varangle A M B<180^{\\circ}$ and $\\varangle A E C+\\varangle A M C<180^{\\circ}$, so $P$ and $P^{\\prime}$ lie on the ray $M A$. Moreover, $\\varangle B P M=$ $\\varangle B D A=90^{\\circ}-\\frac{1}{2} \\varangle P M B$, implying that $\\triangle B P M$ is isosceles with $M P=M B$. Similarly, $M P^{\\prime}=M C=M B$, so $P^{\\prime} \\equiv P$.\nNow it follows from the power of point $P$ that $M B \\cdot M F=M P \\cdot M A=M C \\cdot M G$, i.e. $M F=M G=M A$ and hence $B F=C G$.",

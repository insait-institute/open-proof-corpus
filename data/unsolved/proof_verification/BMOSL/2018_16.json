For example, let $q_{i} \\equiv 1$ and $r_{i} \\equiv 3$ modulo 4. Then, if $n=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} p_{2}^{\\alpha_{2}} \\ldots$, where all but finitely many of the $\\alpha_{i}$ will be zero, set\n\n$$\nb_{n}:=q_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} q_{2}^{\\alpha_{2}} \\cdots, \\quad \\text { for all } n \\geqslant 2\n$$\n\nThis sequence satisfies requirement (iii), but not the ordering conditions (i) and (ii). Iteratively, take $a_{1}=r_{1}$, then given $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$, define $a_{n}$ by multiplying $b_{n}$ by as large a power of $r_{n}$ as necessary in order to ensure $a_{n}>a_{n-1}$. Thus $d\\left(a_{m}, a_{n}\\right)=d\\left(b_{m}, b_{n}\\right)=$ $d(m, n)$, and so all three requirements are satisfied.",

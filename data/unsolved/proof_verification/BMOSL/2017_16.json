            "solution": "Note that it is enough to prove that $\\angle D P A+\\angle M Q A=180^{\\circ}$.\nWithout loss of generality assume that $A B<A C$. Let the reflection of $H$ in point $M$ be $H^{\\prime}$. Since $B H C H^{\\prime}$ is a paralelogram we get\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle B H^{\\prime} C=\\angle B H C=180^{\\circ}-\\measuredangle B A C\n$$\nwhich means $H^{\\prime}$ lies on $\\omega$. Also we get\n$$\n\\angle A B H^{\\prime}=\\angle A B C+\\angle C B H^{\\prime}=\\angle A B C+\\angle B C H=90^{\\circ}\n$$\n\nsince $C H \\perp A B$. This mean $A H^{\\prime}$ is the diameter of $\\omega$. This means $\\measuredangle M P A=\\angle H^{\\prime} P A=90^{\\circ}$. Since $\\angle M P A=\\angle M D A=90^{\\circ}$ we get that $M, D, P, A$ are concyclic.\n\nThis gives us $\\angle D P A+\\angle A M D=180^{\\circ}$. So now it is enough to prove that $\\measuredangle A M B=\\angle M Q A$.\nTaking the homothety with center $G$ and factor $-2$ (the homothety taking the $9$ point circle to the circumcircle of $A B C$ ), we get that $Q$ and $A$ are images of $D$ and $M$ respectively.\n\nThis means $A Q \\| D M$ giving $A Q \\| B C$. Since $A Q \\| B C$ and $A, B, C, Q$ are concyclic this means $A B C Q$ is an iscoseles trapezoid.\nThis means $M$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $A Q$. This gives us $M A=M Q$. Since $A Q \\| B C$ this gives us $\\angle A Q M=\\angle Q A M=\\angle A M B$ which concludes our problem.",

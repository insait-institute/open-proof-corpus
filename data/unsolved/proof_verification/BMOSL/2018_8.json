    "problem": "Alice and Bob play the following game: They start with two non-empty piles of coins. Taking turns, with Alice playing first, they choose a pile with an even number of coins and move half of the coins of this pile to the other pile. The game ends if a player cannot move, or if we reach a previously reached position. In the first case, the player who cannot move loses. In the second case, the game is declared a draw. Determine all pairs \\((a, b)\\) of positive integers such that if initially the two piles have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coins respectively, then Bob has a winning strategy.",

            "solution": "By $v_{2}(n)$ we denote the largest nonnegative integer $r$ such that $2^{r} \\mid n$.\nA position $(a, b)$ (i.e. two piles of sizes $a$ and $b$ ) is said to be $k$-happy if $v_{2}(a)=v_{2}(b)=k$ for some integer $k \\geqslant 0$, and $k$-unhappy if $\\min \\left\\{v_{2}(a), v_{2}(b)\\right\\}=k<\\max \\left\\{v_{2}(a), v_{2}(b)\\right\\}$. We shall prove that Bob has a winning strategy if and only if the initial position is $k$-happy for some even $k$.\n\n- Given a 0-happy position, the player in turn is unable to play and loses.\n- Given a $k$-happy position $(a, b)$ with $k \\geqslant 1$, the player in turn will transform it into one of the positions $\\left(a+\\frac{1}{2} b, \\frac{1}{2} b\\right)$ and $\\left(b+\\frac{1}{2} a, \\frac{1}{2} a\\right)$, both of which are ( $k-1$ )-happy because $v_{2}\\left(a+\\frac{1}{2} b\\right)=v_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} b\\right)=v_{2}\\left(b+\\frac{1}{2} a\\right)=v_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} a\\right)=k-1$.\nTherefore, if the starting position is $k$-happy, after $k$ moves they will get stuck at a $0$-happy position, so Bob will win if and only if $k$ is even.\n- Given a $k$-unhappy position $(a, b)$ with $k$ odd and $v_{2}(a)=k<v_{2}(b)=\\ell$, Alice can move to position $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} a, b+\\frac{1}{2} a\\right)$. Since $v_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} a\\right)=v_{2}\\left(b+\\frac{1}{2} a\\right)=k-1$, this position is ( $k-1$ )-happy with $2 \\mid k-1$, so Alice will win.\n- Given a $k$-unhappy position $(a, b)$ with $k$ even and $v_{2}(a)=k<v_{2}(b)=\\ell$, Alice must not play to position $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} a, b+\\frac{1}{2} a\\right)$, because the new position is $(k-1)$-happy and will lead to Bob's victory. Thus she must play to position $\\left(a+\\frac{1}{2} b, \\frac{1}{2} b\\right)$. We claim that this position is also $k$-unhappy. Indeed, if $\\ell>k+1$, then $v_{2}\\left(a+\\frac{1}{2} b\\right)=$ $k<v_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} b\\right)=\\ell-1$, whereas if $\\ell=k+1$, then $v_{2}\\left(a+\\frac{1}{2} b\\right)>v_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} b\\right)=k$.\n\nHence a $k$-unhappy position is winning for Alice if $k$ is odd, and drawing if $k$ is even.",

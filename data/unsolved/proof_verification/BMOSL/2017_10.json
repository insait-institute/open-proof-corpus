So, the pairs $(x, y)=(2 n, 1), n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ satisfy the required divizibility.\nLet $y>1$ such, that $x^{2}$ is divisible by $2 x y^{2}-y^{3}+1$. There exist $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that\n\n$$\nx^{2}=m\\left(2 x y^{2}-y^{3}+1\\right), \\text { e.t. } x^{2}-2 m y^{2} x+\\left(m y^{3}-m\\right)=0\n$$\n\nThe discriminant of last quadratic equation is equal to $\\Delta=4 m^{2} y^{4}-4 m y^{3}+4 m$. Denote\n\n$$\nA=4 m\\left(y^{2}-1\\right)+(y-1)^{2}, \\quad B=4 m\\left(y^{2}+1\\right)-(y+1)^{2}\n$$\n\nFor $y>1, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we have\n\n$$\nA>0, \\quad B=4 m\\left(y^{2}+1\\right)-(y+1)^{2}>2\\left(y^{2}+1\\right)-(y+1)^{2}=(y-1)^{2} \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow B>0\n$$\n\nWe obtain the following estimations for the discriminant $\\Delta$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta+A=\\left(2 m y^{2}-y+1\\right)^{2} \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta<\\left(2 m y^{2}-y+1\\right)^{2} ; \\\\\n& \\Delta-B=\\left(2 m y^{2}-y-1\\right)^{2} \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta>\\left(2 m y^{2}-y-1\\right)^{2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBecause the discriminant $\\Delta$ must be a perfect square, we obtain the equalities:\n\n$$\n\\Delta=4 m^{2} y^{4}-4 m y^{3}+4 m=\\left(2 m y^{2}-y\\right)^{2} \\Leftrightarrow y^{2}=4 m \\Rightarrow y=2 k, k \\in \\mathbb{N}, m=k^{2}, k \\in \\mathbb{N}\n$$\n\nThe equation $x^{2}-8 k^{4} x+k\\left(8 k^{4}-k\\right)=0$ has the solutions $x=k$ and $x=8 k^{4}-k$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nFinaly, we obtain that all pairs of positive integers $(x, y)$, such that $x^{2}$ is divisible by $2 x y^{2}-y^{3}+1$, are equal to $(x, y) \\in\\left\\{(2 k, 1),(k, 2 k),\\left(8 k^{4}-k, 2 k\\right) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}$.",

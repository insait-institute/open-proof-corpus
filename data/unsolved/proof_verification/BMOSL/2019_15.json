Taking $q=2$ and $p$ any odd prime number, we have\n\n$$\nf(p)^{f(2)}+2^{p}=f(2)^{f(p)}+p^{2} .\n$$\n\nAssume that $f(2) \\neq 2$. It follows that $f(2)$ is odd and so $f(p)=2$ for any odd prime number $p$.\n\nTaking any two different odd prime numbers $p, q$ we have\n\n$$\n2^{2}+q^{p}=2^{2}+p^{q} \\Rightarrow p^{q}=q^{p} \\Rightarrow p=q,\n$$\ncontradiction. Hence, $f(2)=2$.\nSo for any odd prime number $p$ we have\n$$\nf(p)^{2}+2^{p}=2^{f(p)}+p^{2} .\n$$\n\nCopy this relation as\n\n$$\n2^{p}-p^{2}=2^{f(p)}-f(p)^{2}\n$$\n\nLet $T$ be the set of all positive integers greater than $2$, i.e. $T=\\{3,4,5, \\ldots\\}$. The function $g: T \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}, g(n)=2^{n}-n^{2}$, is strictly increasing, i.e.\n\n$$\ng(n+1)-g(n)=2^{n}-2 n-1>0\n$$\nfor all $n \\in T$. We show this by induction. Indeed, for $n=3$ it is true, $2^{3}-2 \\cdot 3-1>0$. Assume that $2^{k}-2 k-1>0$. It follows that for $n=k+1$ we have\n$$\n2^{k+1}-2(k+1)-1=\\left(2^{k}-2 k-1\\right)+\\left(2^{k}-2\\right)>0\n$$\n\nfor any $k \\geq 3$. Therefore, (2) is true for all $n \\in T$.\nAs consequence, (1) holds if and only if $f(p)=p$ for all odd prime numbers $p$, as well as for $p=2$.\n\nTherefore, the only function that satisfies the given relation is $f(p)=p$, for all $p \\in \\mathbb{P}$.",

Therefore the identity function satisfies the problem condition.\n\nIf there is $n_{0}$ with $f\\left(n_{0}\\right) \\neq n_{0}$, consider the characteristic function $g$ that is defined as $g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)=1$ and $g(n)=0$ for $n \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$. In this case, let $n \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$ be arbirtrary. One has $f(g(n))-g(f(n))=$ $f\\left(g\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)-g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right) \\Rightarrow f(0)-g(f(n))=f(0)-g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right) \\Rightarrow g(f(n))=1 \\Rightarrow f(n)=f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$.\n\nNow, consider the very similar function $g$ that is defined as $g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)=a$ and $g(n)=b$ for $n \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$, where $a, b$ are integers with $a \\neq b \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$. We have chosen $a, b$ so as to ensure that $f(a)=f\\left(n_{0}\\right)=f(b)$. Now, we find that $f\\left(g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right)-g\\left(f\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right)=f\\left(g\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)-g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right) \\Rightarrow f(a)-g\\left(f\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right)=f(b)-$ $g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right) \\Rightarrow g\\left(f\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right)=g\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)=a \\Rightarrow f\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$.\n\nIn summary, $f(n)=f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$ for any $n \\neq f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$ and $f\\left(f\\left(n_{0}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(n_{0}\\right)$. Therefore $f$ is a constant function. Let us now see that a constant function indeed satisfies the problem condition: If $f(n)=c$ for all $n, f(g(n))-g(f(n))=c-g(c)$ is independent of $n$.\n\nThe answers are the identity function $f(n)=n$ and the constant functions $f(n)=c$.",

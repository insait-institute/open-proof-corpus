    "problem": "Let \\( \\triangle ABC \\) be an isosceles triangle with \\( AB = AC \\) and \\( \\angle A = 45^\\circ \\).

            "solution": "Solution. Since $Z E$ is the common chord of the two circles, the line of the centres $C O$ is its perpendicular bisector. This means that $C O$ passes through the midpoint of $Z E$, let it be $T$. Thus, it suffices to prove that $F M$ passes through $T$. To this end, we will prove that $F Z M E$ is a parallelogram: we will precisely show that the segments $F E$ and $Z M$ are parallel and equal.\n\nLet $K$ be the intersection point of $Z E$ and $A C$. Then $K$ lies on the radical axis of the two circles, so it has equal powers to both circles. The power of the point $K$ with respect to the one circle is $K A \\cdot K C$, while the power to the other circle is $R^{2}-K C^{2}=C D^{2}-K C^{2}$ \u0433\u0402\u201a\n\nFrom the theorem of Pythagoras in triangle $A D C$ we get $A C^{2}=2 C D^{2}$. We set $K A=x, K C=y$, and combining all the above yields $x y=\\frac{(x+y)^{2}}{2}-y^{2}$, hence $2 x y=$ $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x y-y^{2}$, i.e. $x=y$.\n\nThis means that $K$ is the midpoint of $A C$. Moreover, we have $\\angle A D C=\\angle A M C=$ $90^{\\circ}$, so the points $A, D, M, C$ are on the same circle - let it be $\\left(c_{1}\\right)$ - and the center of this circle is $K$.\n\nFrom the cyclic quadrilateral we have that $\\angle D M B=45^{\\circ}$, but we have also that $\\angle O C B=45^{\\circ}$, so the lines $O C, D M$ are parallel, hence $K Z \\perp D M$ and, since $D M$ is a chord of the circle, $Z D=Z M$. (1)\n\nThe triangle $C D F$ is isosceles and $C O$ is bisector, so $C O \\perp D F$, and this means that $Z E \\| D F$. It follows that $D F E Z$ is an isosceles trapezium, so $D Z=F E$ (2), and from (1) and (2) we have that $Z M=F E(*)$.\n\nFrom the isosceles trapezium we also have that $\\angle F E Z=\\angle D Z E$ (3). Since $Z K$ is an altitude in the isosceles triangle $D Z M$, it will be also angle bisector, so $\\angle D Z E=\\angle M Z E$ (4).\n\nFrom (3) and (4) we conclude that $\\angle F E Z=\\angle M Z E$, so $F E \\| Z M\\left({ }^{* *}\\right)$. From (*) and $\\left({ }^{* *}\\right)$ we get that $F Z M E$ is a parallelogram, which is the desired result.",

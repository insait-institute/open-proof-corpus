            "solution": "Solution. It is well known that the symmetrical points $H_{1}, H_{2}, H_{3}$ of $H$ with respect the sides $B C, A B, A C$ of the triangle $A B C$ respectively lie on the circle (c).\n\nFigure 8: G8\nLet $L$ be the second point of intersection of $(c)$ and $\\left(c_{1}\\right)$. First we will prove that the lines $D_{1} H_{2}, D_{2} H_{3}$ and $U D$ pass through the point $L$.\n\nSuppose that the line $A H$ intersects the side $B C$ at the point $Z$. Since $H_{1} D\\|B C\\| D_{1} D_{2}$ and $B, C$ are the midpoints of the segments $D_{1} D, D_{2} D$ respectively, we get that $Z$ is the midpoint of the segment $H H_{1}$, so the point $H$ lies on $D_{1} D_{2}$. Therefore, $A H \\perp D_{1} D_{2}$ and $A U$ is a diameter of $\\left(c_{1}\\right)$. Thus, $A L \\perp U L$ and $A L \\perp D L$. We have that the points $U, D, L$ are collinear. (1)\n\nNow, $\\angle A L D_{1}=\\angle A D_{2} D_{1}, \\angle A L H_{2}=\\angle A C H_{2}$. Since $A H C D_{2}$ is cyclic we get\n$\\angle A C H_{2}=\\angle A D_{2} D_{1}$. Therefore, $\\angle A L H_{2}=\\angle A L D_{1}$. So the points $D_{1}, H_{2}, L$ are collinear. (2)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\n\\angle D_{1} L D_{2}=\\angle D_{1} A D_{2}=180^{\\circ}-2\\left(\\angle A D_{1} H\\right) .\n$$\n\nSince $A D_{1} B H$ is cyclic we have $\\angle A D_{1} H=\\angle A B H=\\angle A B H_{3}$. Therefore, we get\n\n$$\n\\angle D_{1} L D_{2}=180^{\\circ}-2\\left(\\angle A B H_{3}\\right)=180^{\\circ}-2\\left(\\angle A D H_{3}\\right)=180^{\\circ}-\\angle H_{2} D H_{3} .\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\angle D_{1} L D_{2}+\\angle H_{2} D H_{3}=180^{\\circ} \\quad \\text { or } \\angle D_{1} L D_{2}+\\angle H_{3} L H_{2}=180^{\\circ} .\n$$\n\nSo the points $H_{3}, L, D_{2}$ are collinear. (3)\nFrom (1), (2), (3) we have that the lines $D_{1} H_{2}, D_{2} H_{3}$ and $U D$ are concurrent at the point $L$.\n\nAlso we have\n\n$$\n\\angle H_{3} D A=\\angle D_{2} D A-\\angle C D H_{3}=\\angle A D_{2} D-\\angle C B H_{3}\n$$\nand because $B \\mathrm{HD}_{2} \\mathrm{C}$ is a parallelogram, we get $\\angle C B H_{3}=\\angle H D_{2} C$. So\n$$\n\\angle H_{3} D A=\\angle A D_{2} D-\\angle H D_{2} C=\\angle A D_{2} D_{1}=\\angle A D_{1} D_{2}=\\angle A U D_{2} .\n$$\n\nTherefore, the circumcircle of the triangle $U D L_{1}$ passes through the point $A$. Also, $\\angle A D_{1} K_{1}=\\angle D_{2} D_{1} A=\\angle D_{2} U A$. But $A U L_{1} D$ is cyclic and we have $\\angle D_{2} U A=\\angle H_{3} D A=$ $\\angle H_{3} B A=\\angle H_{3} H_{2} A$. Therefore, $\\angle A D_{1} K_{1}=\\angle H_{3} H_{2} A$. Thus, the circumcircle of the triangle $D_{1} K_{1} H_{2}$ passes through the point $A$.\n\nBecause the points $H_{3}, L, D_{2}$ are collinear by the Desargues theorem, the lines $U D_{1}$, $L_{1} K_{1}, D H_{2}$ are concurrent, let say in the point $M$.\n\nFrom the similarity of the triangles $U D L_{1}$ and $D_{1} K_{1} H_{2}$ we conclude that $M$ is the center of unique spiral similarity and because the circumcircles of the triangles $D_{1} K_{1} H_{2}$ and $U D L_{1}$ intersect at the point $A$, then the second point of intersection is $M$. Therefore, $M$ lies on the line $K_{1} L_{1}$.\n\nComment. We can prove the last part in a different way.\nLet $M$ be the point of intersection of the circumcircles of the triangles $D_{1} K_{1} H_{2}$ and $U D L_{1}$. Now, we have\n\n$$\n\\angle K_{1} M A=\\angle H_{3} H_{2} A=\\angle H_{3} B A=\\angle A D H_{3}=\\angle L_{1} U A=\\angle L_{1} M A .\n$$\n\nTherefore, the points $L_{1}, K_{1}, M$ are collinear.",

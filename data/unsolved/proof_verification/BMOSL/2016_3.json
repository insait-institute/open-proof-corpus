Then $\\left|n\\left(f(x+n+1)-f^{2}(x+n)\\right)\\right|=\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\\left(f(x+i+1)-f^{2}(x+i)\\right)-\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i\\left(f(x+i+1)-f^{2}(x+i)\\right)\\right|<2 C$ implying $\\left|f(x+n+1)-f^{2}(x+n)\\right|<\\frac{2 C}{n}$ for every real number $x$ and every natural number $n$. Let $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary. Then there exists $x$ such that $y=x+n$. We obtain $\\left|f(y+1)-f^{2}(y)\\right|<\\frac{2 C}{n}$ for every real number $y$ and every natural number $n$. The last inequality holds for every natural number $n$ from where $f(y+1)=f^{2}(y)$ for every $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The function $f$ is monotonic which implies that it is an injection and the latter implies $f(y)=y+1$.",

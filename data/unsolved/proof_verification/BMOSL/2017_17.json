            "solution": "Lemma. If $B C D$ is the isoceles triangle which is outside the triangle $A B C$ and has\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle C B D=\\measuredangle B C D=90^{\\circ}-\\alpha: \\stackrel{\\text { not }}{=} \\beta,\n$$\nthen $A D \\perp B_{A} C_{A}$.\nProof of the lemma. Construct an isosceles triangle $A B E$ outside the triangle $A B C$, so that $\\measuredangle A B E=\\measuredangle A E B=\\beta$.\nThen $A E=A B=A B_{A}$ and $\\measuredangle E A B_{A}=\\alpha$, so a rotation of center $A$ and angle $\\alpha$ sends $C_{A}$ to $C$ and $B_{A}$ to $E$, hence $\\Varangle\\left(\\overrightarrow{B_{A} C_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{E C}\\right)=\\alpha$ (the angle between vectors is considered oriented). Also triangles $E B A$ and $B C D$ are similar, so a rotation of center $B$ and angle $\\beta$, followed by\n\na dilation of ratio $\\frac{E B}{A B}=\\frac{B C}{B D}$ sends $E$ to $A$ and $C$ to $D$, hence $\\measuredangle(\\overrightarrow{E C}, \\overrightarrow{A D})=\\beta$ (also oriented angle).\nThis shows that\n$$\n\\measuredangle\\left(\\overrightarrow{B_{A} C_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{A D}\\right)=\\measuredangle\\left(\\overrightarrow{B_{A} C_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{E C}\\right)+\\measuredangle(\\overrightarrow{E C}, \\overrightarrow{A D})=\\alpha+\\beta=90^{\\circ} .\n$$\n\nReturning to the solution of the problem, denote $A^{\\prime}$ the intersection of $B C$ with the perpendicular from $A$ to $B_{A} C_{A}$. Then $A^{\\prime}$ belongs to the segment $B C$ and\n\n$$\n\\frac{A^{\\prime} B}{A^{\\prime} C}=\\frac{A B \\sin (B+\\beta)}{A C \\sin (C+\\beta)}\n$$\n\nSince similar relations are true for the intersections $B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ of the other two perpendiculars with the opposite sides, this yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{A^{\\prime} B}{A^{\\prime} C} \\cdot \\frac{B^{\\prime} C}{B^{\\prime} A} \\cdot \\frac{C^{\\prime} A}{C^{\\prime} B}=\\frac{A B \\sin (B+\\beta)}{A C \\sin (C+\\beta)} \\cdot \\frac{B C \\sin (C+\\beta)}{B A \\sin (A+\\beta)} \\cdot \\frac{C A \\sin (A+\\beta)}{C B \\sin (B+\\beta)}=1\n$$\nwhence the conclusion.\nRemark. The conditions 'acute-angled' and ' $\\alpha<90^{\\circ}$ ' are not essential, but without them there are cases when $A^{\\prime}$ does not belong to the segment $B C$, or the perpendiculars become parallel.",

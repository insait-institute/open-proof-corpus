            "solution": "Solution. Consider any two points $F, G$ on $\\omega$ such that $\\angle B F D=\\angle D G C$. Exploiting the isosceles triangles $\\triangle A F G, \\triangle A F D$, and $\\triangle A D G$, we deduce (using directed angles throughout):\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\angle D B F-\\angle G C D=180^{\\circ}-\\angle B F D-\\angle B D F-\\left(180^{\\circ}-\\angle D G C-\\angle C D G\\right) \\stackrel{(*)}{=} \\\\\n\\angle C D G-\\angle F D B=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot(\\angle D A G-\\angle D A F)=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot\\left[\\left(180^{\\circ}-2 \\cdot \\angle A D G\\right)-\\left(180^{\\circ}-2 \\cdot \\angle A D F\\right)\\right]= \\\\\n\\angle A D F-\\angle G D A=\\angle D F A-\\angle A G D=\\angle D F G-\\angle F G D \\stackrel{(*)}{=} \\angle B F G-\\angle F G C,\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere we use $\\angle B F D=\\angle D G C$ at $\\left(^{*}\\right)$. Thus $B F G C$ is cyclic.\n\nFigure 3: G3\nNow, if in addition $F G \\perp A O$, then since $A$ is the centre of $\\omega$, in fact $A O$ is the perpendicular bisector of $F G$. But by definition, since $A B C$ is scalene, $A O$ meets the perpendicular bisector of $B C$ at $O$. Hence $O$ is the centre of $B F G C$, and thus in fact $B F A G C$ is cyclic. But then the lines perpendicular to $A F$ at $F$, and $A G$ at $G$ (the tangents to $\\omega$ ) must intersect at $E$, the point antipodal to $A$ on $\\odot B F A G C$.\n\nAlternative solution: Let the circumcircle of $A B C$ be $\\Gamma$. From the conditions, $G$ is the reflection of $F$ in the line $A O$. Let $B^{\\prime}, D^{\\prime}$ be the reflections of $B, D$ across this same line $A O$. Clearly $D^{\\prime}$ also lies on $\\omega$ and $B^{\\prime}$ lies on $\\Gamma$.\n\nThen, using directed angles, $\\angle C G D=\\angle D F B=\\angle B^{\\prime} G D^{\\prime}$ so\n\n$$\n\\angle B^{\\prime} G C=\\angle B^{\\prime} G D^{\\prime}-\\angle C G D^{\\prime}=\\angle C G D-\\angle C G D^{\\prime}=\\angle D^{\\prime} G D=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle D^{\\prime} A D=\\angle O A D .\n$$\n\nThen, exploiting the isogonality property that $\\angle D A B=\\angle C A O$, we have $\\angle O A D=\\angle C A B-2 \\angle D A B=\\angle A B C-\\angle B C A=\\angle A B C-\\angle B^{\\prime} B A=\\angle B^{\\prime} B C$.\n\nSo $G$ lies on $\\Gamma$, and by the reflection property so does $F$.\nBut then, as in the previous solution, the tangents at $F$ and $G$ to $\\omega$ must intersect at $E$, the point antipodal to $A$ on $\\Gamma$.",

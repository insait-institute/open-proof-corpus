            "solution": "Let $H$ be the ortocenter of $A B C$ and $K, L, M$ be the feet of perpendiculars respectively from $A, B, C$ to their opposite sides of $A B C$. Also let $D$ be the intersection point of lines $B E$ and $C F$. From power of point we have\n\n$$\nB A \\cdot B M=B C \\cdot B K\n$$\nand\n$$\nC A \\cdot C L=C B \\cdot C K\n$$\n\nAdding (1) and (2) we have:\n\n$$\nC A \\cdot C L+B A \\cdot B M=B C \\cdot B K+C B \\cdot C K=B C(B K+C K)=B C^{2}\n$$\n\nCombining (3) with the problem statement $B C^{2}=B A \\cdot B F+C E \\cdot C A$ we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& B A \\cdot B F-B A \\cdot B M=C A \\cdot C L-C E \\cdot C A \\\\\n& B A(B F-B M)=C A(C L-C E) \\\\\n& B A \\cdot F M=C A \\cdot L E \\\\\n& \\quad \\frac{L E}{F M}=\\frac{A B}{A C}=\\frac{B L}{C M}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhere the last equality follows from $\\triangle A M C \\sim \\triangle A L B$. Now since $\\frac{L E}{F M}=\\frac{B L}{C M}$ and $\\angle F M C=\\angle E L B=90^{\\circ}$ we get that triangles $\\triangle F M C \\sim \\triangle E L B$. From this similarity we get\n\n$$\n\\measuredangle A E D=\\measuredangle A E B=\\angle L E B=\\measuredangle M F C=180^{\\circ}-\\angle A F C=180-\\angle A F D,\n$$\nmeaning points $A, D, E, F$ are concylic.\nSince both pairs $\\{E, F\\}$ and $\\{M, L\\}$ satisfy the problem condition, we must have this fixed point we are looking for is the second intersection of the circumcircles around $A F D E$ and AMHL. Let this point be $X$. We now prove that $X$ is fixed on the circumcircle of $A M H L$ (which would imply $X$ is fixed).\nFrom the concylicity we have\n$$\n\\angle X L E=180^{\\circ}-\\measuredangle X L A=\\measuredangle X M A=\\angle X M F \\text { and } \\measuredangle X E L=\\measuredangle X E A=180-\\measuredangle X F A=\\measuredangle X F M\n$$\n\nand from here we get $\\triangle X L E \\sim \\triangle X M F$. This similarity gives us\n\n$$\n\\frac{X L}{X M}=\\frac{L E}{M F} .\n$$\n\nNow combining (4) and (5) we get $\\frac{X L}{X M}=\\frac{A B}{A C}$ which is a fixed quantity. Since points $M, L$, the circumcircle of $A M L$, and ratio $\\frac{X L}{X M}$ are fixed, this implies that point $X$ is fixed.",

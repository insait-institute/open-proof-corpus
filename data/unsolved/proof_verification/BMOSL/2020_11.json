Let the vertices of the squares be $A C_{1} C_{2} B, B A_{1} A_{2} C, C B_{1} B_{2} A$.\nLemma: $B B_{2}=C C_{1}$ and $B B_{2} \\perp C C_{1}$.\nProof: Notice that by rotating $\\triangle A C_{1} C$ by $90^{\\circ}$ we get $\\triangle A B B_{2}$ proving the lemma.\nClaim: $A O_{a} \\perp O_{b} O_{c}$\nProof: Let $M$ be the midpoint of $A B$. By our lemma applied at vertex $C$ we get $A A_{2}=B B_{1}$ and they are perpendicular. By homothety of factor $2$ at $A$ and then $B$ we get:\n\n$$\nM O_{b}=\\frac{1}{2} B B_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} A A_{2}=M O_{a} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad M O_{b}\\left\\|B B_{1}, M O_{a}\\right\\| A A_{2}\n$$\n\nHence $M O_{a}, M O_{b}$ are also perpendicular so in fact $\\triangle O_{b} M O_{a}$ is an isosceles right triangle. This is also trivially the case for $\\triangle A M O_{c}$. Now applying our lemma to $\\triangle A M O_{b}$ at vertex $M$ we get $O_{b} O_{c}$ and $A O_{a}$ are perpendicular which is exactly what we wanted.\n\nSimilarly we get $B O_{b} \\perp O_{a} O_{c}$ and $C O_{c} \\perp O_{a} O_{b}$ so lines $A O_{a}, B O_{b}, C O_{c}$ concur at $H$, the orthocentre of $\\triangle O_{a} O_{b} O_{c}$. As $A$ lies on $\\omega$ and on $O_{a} H$ it follows $A$ is the reflection of $H$ in line $O_{b} O_{c}$.\n\nClaim: $H=B$ or $H=C$\nProof: Assume not. By the previous observations we get $O_{c} H=O_{c} A=O_{c} B$. Hence as $O_{c} O_{a} \\perp B H$ and $B \\neq H$ this means $B$ is the reflection of $H$ in $O_{c} O_{a}$ so $B$ lies on $\\omega$.\n\nSimilarly, $C$ lies on $\\omega$. But then we get:\n\n$$\n\\angle A C B=180^{\\circ}-\\angle B O_{c} A=90^{\\circ} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\angle C B A=180^{\\circ}-\\angle A O_{b} C=90^{\\circ}\n$$\nso $\\angle A C B+\\angle C B A=180^{\\circ}$ which is absurd so in fact one of $B, C$ is equal to $H$.\nWLOG $B=H$. As $A, H, O_{a}$ and $C, H, O_{c}$ are collinear this means in fact $B$ lies on these lines. Hence:\n$$\n\\angle A O_{c} C=\\angle A O_{c} B=90^{\\circ}\n$$\n\nAlso $\\angle A O_{b} C=90^{\\circ}$ hence $C$ also lies on $\\omega$ and $\\omega$ in fact has diameter $A C$ and so its circumcentre is the midpoint of $A C$ which lies on the perimeter of $\\triangle A B C$.",

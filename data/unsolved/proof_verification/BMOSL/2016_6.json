            "solution": "Solution. First we prove that $f(x) \\geq x$ for all $x>0$.\nIndeed, if there is an $a>0$ with $f(a)<a$ then from the initial for $x=a$ and $y=a-f(a)>0$ we get that $3 a+(a-f(a)) f(a-f(a))=0$. This is absurd since $3 a+(a-f(a)) f(a-f(a))>0$.\nSo we have that\n\n$$\nf(x) \\geq x \\quad \\text {,for all } \\quad x>0\n$$\n\nThen using (1) we have that $f(x)+3 x+y f(x)=f(f(x)+y) \\geq f(x)+y$, so\n\n$$\n3 x+y f(y) \\geq y \\quad, \\text { all } \\quad x, y>0\n$$\n\nSuppose that $y f(y)<y$ for a $y>0$ and let $-y f(y)=b>0$ then for $x=\\frac{b}{4}$ we get $\\frac{3 b}{4}-b \\geq 0$ so $b \\leq 0$, absurd. So we have that $y f(y) \\geq y$, for all $y>0$, and so\n\n$$\nf(y) \\geq 1 \\quad \\text {,for all } \\quad y>0\n$$\n\nSubstituting $y$ with $f(y)$ at the initial we have that\n\n$$\nf(x)+3 x+f(y) f(f(y))=f(f(x)+f(y))\n$$\nand changing the roles of $x, y$ we have that:\n$$\nf(y)+3 y+f(x) f(f(x))=f(f(x)+f(x))\n$$\n\nSo we have $f(x) f(f(x))-f(x)-3 x=f(y) f(f(y))-f(y)-3 y$, which means that the function $f(x) f(f(x))-$ $f(x)-3 x$ is constant. That means that there exist a constant $c$ such that\n\n$$\nf(x) f(f(x))=f(x)+3 x+c \\quad \\text {,for all } \\quad x>0\n$$\n\nSo we can write (6) in the form $f(x)(f(f(x))-1)=3 x+c$ and since $f(f(x))>1$ we have that $3 x+c \\geq 0$, for all $x>0$. if $c<0$ then for $x=-\\frac{c}{4}>0$ we get that $c>0$ which is absurd. So $c \\geq 0$.\nWe write (6) in the form\n\n$$\nf(f(x))=1+\\frac{3 x}{f(x)}+\\frac{c}{f(x)}\n$$\n\nSince $c \\geq 0$ then from (7) with the help of (1) and (3) we have that $f(f(x)) \\leq 4+c$.\nBut from (1) we have that $f(f(x)) \\geq f(x) \\geq x$, for all $x \\geq 0$, and so\n\n$$\n4+c \\geq f(f(x)) \\geq x \\quad \\text {,for all } \\quad x>0\n$$\n\nTaking $x=5+c$ we get that the last one cannot hold. So there is no such a function.",

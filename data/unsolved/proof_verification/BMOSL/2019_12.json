            "solution": "Solution. We will prove that the desired point of concurrency is the midpoint of $B C$. Assume that $\\triangle A B C$ is acute. Let $(A B C)^{5}$ intersect $(A E F)$ at the point $Y^{\\prime}$; we will prove that $Y=Y^{\\prime}$.\n\nFigure 7: G7\nUsing the fact that $H$ is the incenter of $\\triangle D E F$ we get that $D, E^{\\prime}, F$ and $D, F^{\\prime}, E$ are triples of collinear points. Furthermore,\n\n$$\n90^{\\circ}=\\angle{ }^{6} A E H=\\angle A F^{\\prime} H=\\angle A E^{\\prime} H=\\angle A F H \\Rightarrow F^{\\prime}, E^{\\prime}, H \\in\\left(A E F Y^{\\prime}\\right) .\n$$\n\nWe will now prove that the points $Y^{\\prime}, B, D, F^{\\prime}$ are concyclic. Indeed,\n\n$$\n\\angle Y^{\\prime} B D=\\angle Y^{\\prime} B C=\\angle Y^{\\prime} A C=\\angle Y^{\\prime} A E=\\angle Y^{\\prime} F^{\\prime} E \\Rightarrow\\left(Y^{\\prime}, B, D, F^{\\prime}\\right) .\n$$\n\nNow, as\n\n$$\n\\angle F^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} B=\\angle F^{\\prime} D C=\\angle E D C=\\angle C A B=\\angle C Y^{\\prime} B,\n$$\nthe points $C, F^{\\prime}, Y^{\\prime}$ are collinear. Similarly we get that $B, E^{\\prime}, Y^{\\prime}$ are collinear, which implies\n$$\nY^{\\prime}=Y=(A B C) \\cap(A E F) .\n$$\n\n[^4]Since we proved this property using directed angles, we know that it is also true for obtuse triangles.\n\nNotice that the points $A, B, C, H$ form an orthocentric system; in other words $H$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle A B C$ and $A$ is the orthocenter $\\triangle H B C$. Furthermore, notice that $F^{\\prime}$ is to $\\triangle A B C$ as $E^{\\prime}$ is to $\\triangle H B C$ and that $E^{\\prime}$ is to $\\triangle A B C$ as $F^{\\prime}$ is to $\\triangle H B C$. This means that $X$ is to $\\triangle H B C$ as $Y$ is to $\\triangle A B C$ and, as we know the proven property is also true for obtuse triangles, we get\n\n$$\nX=(H B C) \\cap(A E F) .\n$$\n\nBy Reflecting the Orthocenter Lemma we know that in a triangle $A B C$, the reflection of its orthocenter over the midpoint of $B C$ is the antipode of $A$ w.r.t. ( $A B C$ ). Applying this Lemma on the triangles $A B C$ and $H B C$ we get that $Y H$ and $A X$ both go through the midpoint of $B C$, thus finishing the solution.\n\nRemark 1: The crucial part of this solution is defining the points $X, Y$ as intersections of circles. This can also be achieved directly by using similar triangles or by using the Spiral Similarity Lemma on $\\triangle H B C, \\triangle H F^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}$ and $\\triangle A B C, \\triangle A E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$.\n\nRemark 2: We can also invert around $A$ with radius $\\sqrt{A H \\cdot A D}$ or around $H$ with radius $\\sqrt{H A \\cdot H D}$ to prove that $X$ or $Y$ invert to the midpoint of $B C$ by using the existence of the nine-point circle.",

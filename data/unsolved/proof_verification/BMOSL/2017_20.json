    "problem": "A grasshopper is sitting at an integer point in the Euclidean plane. Each second it jumps to another integer point in such a way that the jump vector is constant. A hunter that knows neither the starting point of the grasshopper nor the jump vector (but knows that the jump vector for each second is constant) wants to catch the grasshopper. Each second the hunter can choose one integer point in the plane and, if the grasshopper is there, he catches it. Can the hunter always catch the grasshopper in a finite amount of time?",

            "solution": "The hunter can catch the grasshopper. Here is the strategy for him. Let $f$ be any bijection between the set of positive integers and the set $\\{((x, y),(u, v)): x, y, u, v \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, and denote\n\n$$\nf(t)=\\left(\\left(x_{t}, y_{t}\\right),\\left(u_{t}, v_{t}\\right)\\right) .\n$$\n\nIn the second $t$, the hunter should hunt at the point $\\left(x_{t}+t u_{t}, y_{t}+t v_{t}\\right)$. Let us show that this strategy indeed works.\nAssume that the grasshopper starts at the point ( $x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}$ ) and that the jump vector is ( $u^{\\prime}, v^{\\prime}$ ). Then in the second $t$ the grasshopper is at the point $\\left(x^{\\prime}+t u^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}+t v^{\\prime}\\right)$. Let\n\n$$\nt^{\\prime}=f^{-1}\\left(\\left(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}\\right),\\left(u^{\\prime}, v^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe hunter's strategy dictates that in the second $t^{\\prime}$ he searches for the grasshopper at the point $\\left(x_{t^{\\prime}}+t^{\\prime} u_{t^{\\prime}}, y_{t^{\\prime}}+t^{\\prime} v_{t^{\\prime}}\\right)$, which is actually $\\left(x^{\\prime}+t^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}+t^{\\prime} v^{\\prime}\\right)$, and this is precisely the point where the grasshopper is in the second $t^{\\prime}$. This completes the proof.",

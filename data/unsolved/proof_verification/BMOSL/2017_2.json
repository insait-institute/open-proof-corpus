Rewrite the recurrence formula in the form $x_{n}=\\frac{1}{x_{n+1}-1}-\\frac{1}{x_{n}-1}, n \\geq 1$, to get\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_{k}=\\frac{1}{x_{n+1}-1}-\\frac{1}{x_{1}-1}=\\frac{x_{n}^{2}-x_{n}+1}{x_{n}-1}-3=\\frac{\\left(x_{n}-2\\right)^{2}}{x_{n}-1}\n$$\n\nFinally, express the positive rational number $x_{n}-1$ in lowest terms, $x_{n}-1=\\frac{a}{b}$, to deduce that $\\frac{(a-b)^{2}}{a b}$ expresses $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_{k}$ the lowest terms.\nSince $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{gcd}(a-b, b)=1 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{gcd}\\left((a-b)^{2}, b\\right)=1$. Similarly we can prove that $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left((a-b)^{2}, a\\right)=1$, which implies that $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left((a-b)^{2}, a b\\right)=1$.\nThe conclusion follows.",

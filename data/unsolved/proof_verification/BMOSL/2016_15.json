Consider the given expression $(\\bmod p)$ where $p \\mid n$ is a prime number. $p|n \\Rightarrow p-1| \\phi(n)$, thus for any $k$ that is not divisible by $p$, one has $k^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$. There are $n-\\frac{n}{p}$ numbers among $1,2, \\ldots, n$ that are not divisible by $p$. Therefore\n\n$$\n1^{\\phi(n)}+2^{\\phi(n)}+\\ldots+n^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv-\\frac{n}{p} \\quad(\\bmod p)\n$$\n\nIf the given expression is coprime with $n$, it is not divisible by $p$, so $p \\nmid \\frac{n}{p} \\Rightarrow p^{2} X n$. This is valid for all prime divisors $p$ of $n$, thus $n$ must be square-free. On the other hand, if $n$ is square-free, one has $p^{2} \\nmid n \\Rightarrow p \\nmid \\frac{n}{p}$, hence the given expression is not divisible by $p$. Since this is valid for all prime divisors $p$ of $n$, the given two numbers are indeed coprime.\n\nThe answer is square-free integers.",

The circumcenter of the triangle $\\triangle M N H$ coincides with the incentre of the triangle $\\triangle A B C$ because the triangles $\\triangle B M H$ and $\\triangle N H C$ are isosceles and therefore the perpendiculars of the $M H, H N$ are also the bisectors of the angles $\\angle A B C, \\angle A C B$, respectively.\n\n\nLet $G, I$ be the points of tangents of the incircle $(O, r)$ of the triangle $\\triangle A B C$ with the sides $A B$ and $A C$ respectively. Now if $a, b, c$ are the sides of the triangle $\\triangle A B C$ and $s$ the semiperimeter of the triangle , we have\n\n$$\nO F^{2}=O G^{2}+F G^{2}=r^{2}+(a-s+b)^{2}\n$$\nand\n$$\nO E^{2}=O I^{2}+E I^{2}=r^{2}+(a-s+c)^{2}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\nO F^{2}-O E^{2}=\\alpha(b-c)\n$$\n\nApplying two times the theorem of Stewarts at the triangles $\\triangle K F B$ and $\\triangle K A C$ we get\n\n$$\nF A \\cdot K A^{2}+c \\cdot K F^{2}=a \\cdot K A^{2}+a c \\cdot F A \\quad \\text { or } \\quad K F^{2}=K A^{2}+a(a-c)\n$$\nand\n$$\nE A \\cdot K E^{2}+\\alpha \\cdot K A^{2}=b \\cdot K E^{2}+a b \\cdot E A \\quad \\text { or } \\quad K E^{2}=K A^{2}+a(b-a)\n$$\n\nFrom (2) and (3) we have\n\n$$\nK F^{2}-K E^{2}=a(a-c)-a(b-a)=\\alpha(b-c)\n$$\n\nFrom (1),(4), because $O F^{2}-O E^{2}=K F^{2}-K E^{2}$ we have that $F E \\perp O K$.\n\nLet $J$ the point of intersection of $F E, O K$.\nBecause $A_{1} D / / O C_{1}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{J O}{J A_{1}}=\\frac{J C_{1}}{J D}\n$$\n\nAnd since $A_{1} E / / H N$ we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{J E}{J A_{1}}=\\frac{J C_{1}}{J B_{1}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{J O}{J E}=\\frac{J B_{1}}{J D}\n$$\n\nThus, from the inverse of Thales theorem we have that $E O / / D B_{1}$, So\n\n$$\nA M_{1} \\perp E O\n$$\n\nConsequently, the point $E$ is the orthocenter of the triangle $\\triangle A_{1} O M_{1}$\nRemark(PSC): Here in the solution the side $B C$ has been referred as $\\alpha$ and $a$, which are equivalent.",

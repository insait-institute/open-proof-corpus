    "problem": "There is a population \\( P \\) of \\( 10000 \\) bacteria, some of which are friends (friendship is mutual), so that each bacterium has at least one friend. If we wish to assign to each bacterium a colored membrane so that no two friends have the same color, then there is a way to do it with \\( 2021 \\) colors, but not with \\( 2020 \\) or fewer.\n\nTwo friends \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) can decide to merge, in which case they become a single bacterium whose friends are precisely the union of friends of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). (Merging is not allowed if \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are not friends.) It turns out that no matter how we perform one merge or two consecutive merges, in the resulting population it would be possible to assign \\( 2020 \\) colors or fewer so that no two friends have the same color. Is it true that in any such population \\( P \\) every bacterium has at least \\( 2021 \\) friends?",

            "solution": "Solution 1. The answer is affirmative.\nWe will use the terminology of graph theory. Here the vertices of our main graph $G$ are the bacteria and there is an edge between two precisely when they are friends. The degree $d(v)$ of a vertex $v$ of $G$ is the number of neighbours of $v$. The minimum degree $\\delta(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest amongst all $d(v)$ for vertices $v$ of $G$. The chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of $G$ is the number of colours needed in order to colour the vertices such that neighbouring vertices get distinct colours.\n\nIt suffices to establish the following:\nClaim. Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a graph on $n>k$ vertices with $\\delta(G) \\geqslant 1$ and $\\chi(G)=k$. Suppose that merging one pair or two pairs of vertices results in a graph $G^{\\prime}$ with $\\chi\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant k-1$. Then $\\delta(G) \\geqslant k$.\n\nWe establish this in a series of claims.\nClaim 1. $\\delta(G) \\geqslant k-1$.\nProof. Suppose for contradiction that we have a vertex $v$ of degree $r \\leqslant k-2$ and denote its neighbours by $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{r}$. (Note that, by assumption, $v$ has at least one neighbour.)\n\nSuppose we merge $v$ with $v_{i}$. We denote the new vertex by $v_{0}$, and we colour the obtained graph in $k-1$ colours. Note that at most $r \\leqslant k-2$ colours can appear in the set $S_{1}=$ $\\left\\{v_{0}, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \\ldots, v_{r}\\right\\}$. Therefore we can get a $(k-1)$-colouring of $G$ by assigning the colour of $v_{0}$ to $v_{i}$ and an unused colour (from the $k-1$ available) to $v$, thus contradicting the assumption that $\\chi(G)=k$.\n\nSo from now on we may assume that there is a vertex $v$ of $G$ with $\\operatorname{deg}(v)=k-1$, as otherwise the proof is complete. We denote its neighbours by $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}$.\n\nClaim 2. The set of neighbours of $v$ induces a complete graph.\nProof of Claim 2. Suppose $v_{i} v_{j} \\notin E(G)$. Merge $v$ with $v_{i}$, giving a next vertex $w$, and then merge $w$ with $v_{j}$, denoting the newest vertex by $v_{0}$. Then colour the resulting graph in $k-1$ colours. Note that at most $k-2$ colours can appear in the set $S_{2}=\\left\\{v_{0}, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\} \\backslash\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\}$. So we can get a $(k-1)$-colouring of $G$ by assigning the colour of $v_{0}$ to $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ and an unused colour (from the $k-1$ available) to $v$, thus contradicting the assumption that $\\chi(G)=k$.\n\nClaim 3. For every edge $u w$, both $u$ and $w$ belong in the set $\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\}$.\nProof. Otherwise merge $u$ and $w$ and call the new vertex $z$. If $u, w \\notin\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\}$ then by Claim $2$ the resulting graph contains a complete graph on $\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\}$ and so its chromatic number is at least $k$, a contradiction. If one of $u, w$ belongs in the set $\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\right\\}$, say\n$u=v_{i}$, then the resulting graph contains a complete graph on $\\left\\{v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}, z\\right\\} \\backslash\\left\\{v_{i}\\right\\}$. This is again a contradiction.\n\nFrom Claim $3$ we see that $G$ consists of a complete set on $k$ vertices together with $n-k>0$ isolated vertices. This is a contradiction as $\\delta(G) \\geqslant 1$.\n\nRemark. We do not know if the result is best possible or whether it can be improved to show $\\delta(G) \\geqslant 2022$.",

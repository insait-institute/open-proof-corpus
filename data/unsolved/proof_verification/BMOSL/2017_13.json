From power of point we have\n\n$$\nB G \\cdot B C=B E \\cdot B D .\n$$\n\nCombining (1) with the problem statement we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{B C \\cdot B C}{B D}=B E=\\frac{B C^{2}-C D \\cdot C A}{B D}\n$$\nand from here we get\n$$\nC D \\cdot C A=B C(B C-B G)=B C \\cdot C G .\n$$\n\n(2) implies that $D, A, B, G$ are concyclic as well. This gives us\n\n$$\n\\angle B E C=\\measuredangle B G D=180^{\\circ}-\\measuredangle B A D=180-\\measuredangle C A B .\n$$\n\nNow let the circumcircle of $A D E$ and $B E C$ intersect again at $X$. Since\n\n$$\n\\angle X C B=\\angle X E B=180^{\\circ}-\\measuredangle X E D=\\angle X A D=\\angle X A C\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\angle B X C=\\angle B E C=180^{\\circ}-\\angle B A C\n$$\n\nwe have that $X$ is on the unique circle through $A$ and $C$ tangent to side $B C$ at point $C$ and circumcircle of $B H C$ where $H$ is the ortocenter of triangle $A B C$. This intersection is unique and we are done.",

            "solution": "Solution 1. We will show that that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. It is easy to check that this function satisfies the equation.\n\nWe write $P(x, y)$ for the assertion that $f(x f(x+y))=y f(x)+1$.\nWe first show that $f$ is injective. So assume $f\\left(x_{1}\\right)=f\\left(x_{2}\\right)$ and take any $x<x_{1}, x_{2}$. Then $P\\left(x, x_{1}-x\\right)$ and $P\\left(x, x_{2}-x\\right)$ give\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{1}-x\\right) f(x)+1=f\\left(x f\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(x f\\left(x_{2}\\right)\\right)=\\left(x_{2}-x\\right) f(x)+1\n$$\ngiving $x_{1}=x_{2}$.\nIt is also immediate that for every $z>1$ there is an $x$ such that $f(x)=z$. Indeed $P\\left(x, \\frac{z-1}{f(x)}\\right)$ gives that\n$$\nf\\left(x f\\left(x+\\frac{z-1}{f(x)}\\right)\\right)=z .\n$$\n\nNow given $z>1$, take $x$ such that $f(x)=z$. Then $P\\left(x, \\frac{z-1}{z}\\right)$ gives\n\n$$\nf\\left(x f\\left(x+\\frac{z-1}{z}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{z-1}{z} f(x)+1=z=f(x) .\n$$\n\nSince $f$ is injective, we deduce that $f\\left(x+\\frac{z-1}{z}\\right)=1$.\nSo there is a $k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$such that $f(k)=1$. Since $f$ is injective this $k$ is unique. Therefore $x=k+\\frac{1}{z}-1$. I.e. for every $z>1$ we have\n\n$$\nf\\left(k+\\frac{1}{z}-1\\right)=z\n$$\n\nWe must have $k+\\frac{1}{z}-1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$for each $z>1$ and taking the limit as $z$ tends to infinity we deduce that $k \\geqslant 1$. (Without mentioning limits, assuming for contradiction that $k<1$, taking $z=\\frac{2}{1-k}$ leads to a contradiction.) Set $r=k-1$.\n\nNow $P\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right)$ gives\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}\\right) f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{1}{3} f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}\\right)+1=\\frac{6}{3}+1=3=f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{3}\\right) .\n$$\n\nBut\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}\\right) f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(\\left(r+\\frac{1}{6}\\right) f\\left(r+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(2 r+\\frac{1}{3}\\right) .\n$$\n\nThe injectivity of $f$ now shows that $r=0$, i.e. that $f(1)=k=1$.\nThis shows that $f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)=z$ for every $z>1$, i.e. $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$ for every $x<1$. Now for $x>1$ consider $P(1, x-1)$ to get $f(f(x))=(x-1) f(1)+1=x=f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$. Injectivity of $f$ shows that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$.\nSo for all possible values of $x$ we have shown that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nSolution 2. $P(1, y)$ shows that $f(f(y+1))=y f(1)+1$. Now $P\\left(f(y+1), \\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1}\\right)$ shows that\n\n$$\nf\\left(f(y+1) f\\left(f(y+1)+\\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1} f(f(y+1))+1=y f(1)+1\n$$\n\nSince $f$ is injective (as in Solution 1) we get that\n\n$$\nf(y+1) f\\left(f(y+1)+\\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1}\\right)=f(y+1)\n$$\nand therefore there is a unique $k$ such that $f(k)=1$. Furtermore, for every $y>0$ we have\n$$\nf(y+1)=k-\\frac{y f(1)}{y f(1)+1}\n$$\n\nThe right hand side of (1) is always positive. But letting $y$ tend to infinity, the right hand side tends to $k-1$ so we must have $k \\geqslant 1$.\n\nIf $k>1$, then $P(k-1,1)$ gives\n\n$$\nf(k-1)=f((k-1) f(k))=f(k-1)+1\n$$\na contradiction. So $f(1)=k=1$.\nFor $x<1, P(x, 1-x)$ gives\n$$\nf(x)=f(x f(x+(1-x)))=(1-x) f(x)+1\n$$\n\nfrom which we deduce that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$. To show that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$ for $x>1$ we can either work as in Solution $1$ or take $y=x-1$ in (1) to get that\n\n$$\nf(x)=1-\\frac{x-1}{(x-1)+1}=\\frac{1}{x}\n$$",

            "solution": "Answer: $f(n)=n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nTaking $m=n=1$ in $(*)$ yields $1+f(1)!\\mid f(1)!+f(1)$ and hence $1+f(1)!\\mid f(1)-1$. Since $|f(1)-1|<f(1)!+1$, this implies $f(1)=1$.\nFor $m=1$ in $(*)$ we have $n!+1 \\mid f(n)!+1$, which implies $n!\\leqslant f(n)$ !, i.e. $f(n) \\geqslant n$.\nOn the other hand, taking $(m, n)=(1, p-1)$ for any prime number $p$ and using Wilson's theorem we obtain $p|(p-1)!+1| f(p-1)!+1$, implying $f(p-1)<p$. Therefore\n\n$$\nf(p-1)=p-1\n$$\n\nNext, fix a positive integer $m$. For any prime number $p$, setting $n=p-1$ in (*) yields $(p-1)!+f(m)!\\mid(p-1)!+f(m!)$, and hence\n\n$$\n(p-1)!+f(m)!\\mid f(m!)-f(m)!\\text { for all prime numbers } p\n$$\n\nThis implies $f(m!)=f(m)$ ! for all $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, so $(*)$ can be rewritten as $n!+f(m)!\\mid$ $f(n)!+f(m)$ !. This implies\n\n$$\nn!+f(m)!\\mid f(n)!-n!\\text { for all } n, m \\in \\mathbb{N}\n$$\n\nFixing $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and taking $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ large enough, we conclude that $f(n)$ ! $=n$ !, i.e. $f(n)=n$, for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nOne readily checks that the identity function satisfies the conditions of the problem.",

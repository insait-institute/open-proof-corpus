As the arithmetic mean of $1, \\ldots, n$ is $\\frac{n+1}{2}$, if we look at these rational numbers in their irreducible form, we can say that $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant n-1$.\n\nA non-zero difference $|a-b|$ with $a, b \\in M$ is then of form\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{x}{k}-\\frac{y}{p}\\right|=\\frac{\\left|p_{0} x-k_{0} y\\right|}{[k, p]}\n$$\nwhere $[k, p]$ is the l.c.m. of $k, p$, and $k_{0}=\\frac{[k, p]}{k}, p_{0}=\\frac{[k, p]}{p}$. Then $|a-b| \\geqslant \\frac{1}{[k, p]}$, as $\\left|p_{0} x-k_{0} y\\right|$ is a non-zero integer. As\n$$\n\\max \\{[k, p] \\mid 1 \\leqslant k<p \\leqslant n-1\\}=(n-1)(n-2),\n$$\n\nwe can say that $m=\\min _{\\substack{a, b \\in M \\\\ a \\neq b}}|a-b| \\geqslant \\frac{1}{(n-1)(n-2)}$.\nTo reach this minimum, we seek $x \\in\\{3,4, \\ldots, 2 n-1\\}$ and $y \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ for which\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-x}{n-2}-\\frac{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-y}{n-1}\\right|=\\frac{1}{(n-1)(n-2)},\n$$\nmeaning\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-(n-1) x+(n-2) y\\right|=1 .\n$$\n\nIf $n=2 k$, we can choose $x=k+3$ and $y=2$ and if $n=2 k+1$ we can choose $x=n=2 k+1$ and $y=k$. Therefore, the required minimum is $\\frac{1}{(n-1)(n-2)}$.\n\nComment. For $n \\geqslant 5$, the only other possibilities are to take $x=3 k-1, y=2 k-1$ if $n=2 k$ and to take $x=2 k+3, y=k+2$ if $n=2 k+1$. (For $n=3,4$ there are also examples where one of the sets is of size $n$.)",

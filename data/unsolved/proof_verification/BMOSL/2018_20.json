            "solution": "Let us take $n=3^{k}$ and suppose that $p$ is a prime divisor of $\\left(3^{k} y\\right)^{2}+1$ such that $p \\equiv 2$ $(\\bmod 3)$.\nSince $p$ divides $x^{\\varphi(n)}-1=x^{2 \\cdot 3^{k-1}}-1$, the order of $x$ modulo $p$ divides both $p-1$ and $2 \\cdot 3^{k-1}$, but $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(p-1,2 \\cdot 3^{k-1}\\right) \\mid 2$, which implies that $p \\mid x^{2}-1$. The result will follow if we prove that the prime $p$ can take infinitely many values.\nSuppose, to the contrary, that there are only finitely many primes $p$ with $p \\equiv 2(\\bmod 3)$ that divide a term of the sequence\n\n$$\na_{k}=3^{2 k} y^{2}+1 \\quad(k \\geqslant 0)\n$$\n\nLet $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{m}$ be these primes. Clearly, we may assume without loss of generality that $3 \\nmid y$. Then $a_{0}=y^{2}+1 \\equiv 2(\\bmod 3)$, so it has a prime divisor of the form $3 s+2$ $\\left(s \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}\\right)$.\nFor $N=\\left(y^{2}+1\\right) p_{1} \\cdots p_{m}$ we have $a_{\\varphi(N)}=3^{2 \\varphi(N)} y^{2}+1 \\equiv y^{2}+1(\\bmod N)$, which means that\n\n$$\na_{\\varphi(N)}=\\left(y^{2}+1\\right)\\left(t p_{1} \\cdots p_{m}+1\\right)\n$$\nfor some positive integer $t$. Since $y^{2}+1 \\equiv 2(\\bmod 3)$ and $3^{2 \\varphi(N)} y^{2}+1 \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)$, the number $t p_{1} \\cdots p_{m}+1$ must have a prime divisor of the form $3 s+2$, but it cannot be any of the primes $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}$, so we have a contradiction as desired.",

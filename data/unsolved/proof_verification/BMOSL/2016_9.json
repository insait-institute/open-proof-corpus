We shall prove that, for each large enough $n$, the number $(n!)^{d-1}$ is a $d$-digit palindrome in all number bases $\\frac{n!}{i}-1$ for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$. In particular, we shall prove that the digit expansion of $(n!)^{d-1}$ in the base $\\frac{n!}{i}-1$ is\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle i^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{d-1}, i^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{d-2}, i^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{d-3}, \\ldots, i^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{1}, i^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{0}\\right\\rangle_{\\frac{n!}{i}-1}\n$$\n\nWe first show that, for each large enough $n$, all these digits are smaller than the considered base, that is, they are indeed digits in that base. It is enough to check this assertion for $i=n$, that is, to show the inequality $n^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{j}<(n-1)$ ! $-1$. However, since for a fixed $d$ the right-hand side clearly grows faster than the left-hand side, this is indeed true for all large enough $n$.\n\nEverything that is left is to evaluate:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} i^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{j}\\left(\\frac{n!}{i}-1\\right)^{j} & =i^{d-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{j}\\left(\\frac{n!}{i}-1\\right)^{j}=i^{d-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}\\binom{d-1}{j}\\left(\\frac{n!}{i}-1\\right)^{j} \\\\\n& =i^{d-1}\\left(\\frac{n!}{i}-1+1\\right)^{d-1}=(n!)^{d-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich completes the proof.",

            "solution": "Solution. Denote by $I_{b}$ and $I_{c}$ the respective excenters opposite to $B$ and $C$. Also denote the midpoint of side $B C$ by $D$, the midpoint of the arc $B A C$ by $M$, and the midpoint of segment $A M$ by $N$. Recall that $M$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $B C$, i.e. on line $O D$. Points $I, O, D, P$ lie on the circle with diameter $O P$, whereas points $I, O, Q, N$ lie on the circle with diameter $O Q$. Thus $\\angle I O P=\\angle I D P$ and $\\angle I O Q=180^{\\circ}-\\angle I N Q=\\angle I N A$. So the triangles $I A N$ and $Q I O$ are similar.\n\n\nOn the other hand, points $B, C, I_{b}, I_{c}$ are on the circle with diameter $I_{b} I_{c}$, so the triangles $I B C$ and $I I_{c} I_{b}$ are similar. We have $\\angle I I_{c} A=\\angle C I_{c} I_{b}=\\angle C B I_{b}=\\frac{1}{2} \\beta$. Since also $\\angle I B A=$ $\\frac{1}{2} \\beta=\\angle I I_{c} A$ then we deduce (the known fact) that $I_{c}, A, I, B$ are concyclic. Thus $\\angle B I_{c} A=$ $180^{\\circ}-A I B=\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)$. Since also $I_{c} M B=A M B=A C B=\\gamma$, then we also have that $\\angle I_{c} B M=\\angle B I_{c} A=\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)$. We deduce that $I_{c} M=M B=M C=I_{b} M$, i.e. $M$ is the midpoint of $I_{b} I_{c}$.\n\nIt follows that the triangles $I B D$ and $I I_{c} M$ are similar, so $\\angle I O P=\\angle I D P=\\angle I M A$. Thus the triangles $O I P$ and $M A I$ are similar. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\frac{I Q}{I O}=\\frac{I A}{A N}=\\frac{2 I A}{A M}=\\frac{2 I P}{I O} .\n$$\n\nThus $I Q=2 I P$.",

            "solution": "Solution 1. We will show that $f(x)=x$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. It is easy to check that this function satisfies the equation.\n\nWe write $P(x, y)$ for the assertion that $f(x+f(x)+f(y))=2 f(x)+y$.\nWe first show that $f$ is injective. So assume $f(a)=f(b)$. Now $P(1, a)$ and $P(1, b)$ show that\n\n$$\n2 f(1)+a=f(1+f(1)+f(a))=f(1+f(1)+f(b))=2 f(1)+b\n$$\nand therefore $a=b$.\nLet $A=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}: f(x)=x\\right\\}$. It is enough to show that $A=\\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n$P(x, x)$ shows that $x+2 f(x) \\in A$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Now $P(x, x+2 f(x))$ gives that\n$$\nf(2 x+3 f(x))=x+4 f(x)\n$$\n\nfor every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Therefore $P(x, 2 x+3 f(x))$ gives that $2 x+5 f(x) \\in A$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\nSuppose $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$such that $x, 2 x+y \\in A$. Then $P(x, y)$ gives that\n\n$$\nf(2 x+f(y))=f(x+f(x)+f(y))=2 f(x)+y=2 x+y=f(2 x+y)\n$$\nand by the injectivity of $f$ we have that $2 x+f(y)=2 x+y$. We conlude that $y \\in A$ as well.\nNow since $x+2 f(x) \\in A$ and $2 x+5 f(x)=2(x+2 f(x))+f(x) \\in A$ we deduce that $f(x) \\in A$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. I.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n\nBy injectivity of $f$ we now conclude that $f(x)=x$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n\nSolution 2. As in Solution $1, f$ is injective. Furthermore, letting $m=2 f(1)$ we have that the image of $f$ contains $(m, \\infty)$. Indeed, if $t>m$, say $t=m+y$ for some $y>0$, then $P(1, y)$ shows that $f(1+f(1)+f(y))=t$.\n\nLet $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We will show that $f(a)-a=f(b)-b$. Define $c=2 f(a)-2 f(b)$ and $d=$ $a+f(a)-b-f(b)$. It is enough to show that $c=d$. By interchanging the roles of $a$ and $b$ in necessary, we may assume that $d \\geqslant 0$.\n\nFrom $P(a, y)$ and $P(b, y)$, after subtraction, we get\n\n$$\nf(a+f(a)+f(y))-f(b+f(b)+f(y))=2 f(a)-2 f(b)=c .\n$$\nso for any $t>m$ (picking $y$ such that $f(y)=t$ in (1)) we get\n$$\nf(a+f(a)+t)-f(b+f(b)+t)=2 f(a)-2 f(b)=c .\n$$\n\nNow for any $z>m+b+f(b)$, taking $t=z-b-f(b)$ in (2) we get\n\n$$\nf(z+d)-f(z)=c\n$$\n\nNow for any $x>m+b+f(b)$ from (3) we get that\n\n$$\n2 f(x+d)+y=2 f(x)+y+2 c .\n$$\n\nAlso, for any $x$ large enough, $(x>\\max \\{m+b+f(b), m+b+f(b)+c-d\\}$ will do), by repeated application of (3), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(x+d+f(x+d)+f(y)) & =f(x+f(x+d)+y)+c \\\\\n& =f(x+f(x)+y+c)+c \\\\\n& =f(x+f(x)+y+c-d)+2 c .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(In the first equality we applied (3) with $z=x+f(x+d)+y>x>m+b+f(b)$, in the second with $z=x>m+b+f(b)$ and in the third with $z=x+f(x)+y-c+d>x+c-d>m+b+f(b)$.\nIn particular, now $P(x+d, y)$ implies that\n\n$$\nf(x+f(x)+y+c-d)=2 f(x)+y=f(x+f(x)+y)\n$$\nfor every large enough $x$. By injectivity of $f$ we deduce that $x+f(x)+y+c-d=x+f(x)+y$ and therefore $c=d$ as required.\n\nIt now follows that $f(x)=x+k$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$and some fixed constant $k$. Substituting in the initial equation we get $k=0$.",

Firstly, considering $(x, y)=(1,1)$ we get $f(0)=-1$.\nThen, setting $y=1$, we see that $-x=f(f(1)-f(x))$, so $f$ must be surjective.\nNow let $(x, y)=(a, 0)$ and $(0, a)$ to get\n$$\n-1=a+f(-1-f(a)) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad-1=-a+f(f(a)+1)\n$$\n\nSince $f$ is surjective, for any real $z$ we may write $z=f(a)+1$ and then adding these two results gives $f(z)+f(-z)=-2$.\n\nLetting $(x, y)=(a, 1)$ and $(1, a)$ we get\n\n$$\n-a=f(f(1)-f(a)) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a)=a f(1)+1+f(f(a)-f(1)) .\n$$\n\nAdding these, and using the previous result with $z=f(a)-f(1)$ gives\n\n$$\nf(a)=a f(1)+a-1 .\n$$\n\nSo $f(x)=k x-1$ for all $x$, for some fixed $k$. Substituting back into the original equation we see that $1$ and $-1$ are the only possibilities for $k$ and that both of these values do give a function that works.\n\nAlternative solution. We prove that $f(x)=x-1$ and $f(x)=-x-1$ are the only solutions. Let $x=y=1$; this gives $f(1)=f(1)+1+f(0)$, so $f(0)=-1$. Then let $(x, y)=(0, a+1),(-a-1,0)$, and $(-a, 1)$ to give the three equalities\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(0)=(a+1) f(0)+f(f(a+1)-f(0)) & \\Rightarrow a=f(f(a+1)+1) \\\\\nf(0)=-a-1+f(f(0)-f(-a-1)) & \\Rightarrow a=f(-f(-a-1)-1) \\\\\nf(-a)=f(-a)-a+f(f(1)-f(a)) & \\Rightarrow a=f(f(1)-f(-a)) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe last of these three implies $f$ is bijective, hence we have\n\n$$\nf(a+1)+1=-f(-a-1)-1=f(1)-f(-a)\n$$\n\nFrom the second of these equalities we can deduce the recurrence relation $f(x)=$ $f(x-1)+f(1)+1$, so if $c=f(1)+1$, we have $f(x)=c x-1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Substituting into the original equation we see that $c^{2}=1$, so $f(x)=x-1$ or $f(x)=-x-1$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIn the first case, let $x=1$. Then $f(y)=1+f(f(y))$, which implies $f(x)=x-1$ for all $x$ as $f$ is surjective. In the second case, set $x=-1$, so $f(-y)=-1+f(f(y))$. However from above we have $f(a+1)+f(-a-1)=2$, so $f(f(y))-1=f(-y)=-f(y)-2$, and we have $f(x)=-x-1$ by surjectivity.",

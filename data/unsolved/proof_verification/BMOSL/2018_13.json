            "solution": "Let the line through $M$ parallel to $A B$ meet the segments $A D, D H, B C, C H$ at points $K, P, L, Q$, respectively. Triangle $H P Q$ is isosceles, so $M P=M Q$. Now from\n\n$$\n\\frac{M P}{B H}=\\frac{D M}{D B}=\\frac{K M}{A B} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{M Q}{A H}=\\frac{C M}{C A}=\\frac{M L}{A B}\n$$\nwe obtain $A H / H B=K M / M L$.\nLet the lines $A D$ and $B C$ meet at point $S$ and let the line $S M$ meet $A B$ at $H^{\\prime}$. Then $A H^{\\prime} / H^{\\prime} B=K M / M L=A H / H B$, so $H^{\\prime} \\equiv H$, i.e. $S$ lies on the line $M H$.\nThe quadrilateral $A B C D$ is not a trapezoid, so $A H \\neq B H$. Consider the point $A^{\\prime}$ on the ray $H B$ such that $H A^{\\prime}=H A$. Since $\\varangle S A^{\\prime} M=\\varangle S A M=\\varangle S B M$, quadrilateral $A^{\\prime} B S M$ is cyclic and therefore $\\varangle A B C=\\varangle A^{\\prime} B S=\\varangle A^{\\prime} M H=\\varangle A M H=90^{\\circ}-\\varangle B A C$, which implies that $\\varangle A C B=90^{\\circ}$.",

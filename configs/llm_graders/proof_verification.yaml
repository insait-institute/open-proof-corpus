prompt: |
  Your task is to help a human mathematician grade a proof solution to the given problem. In this task, you will write a summary of the provided proof and highlight potential issues with it. 

  ### Input:

  Your input will consist of the following components:
  - **Problem Statement**: A mathematical problem that the proof is attempting to solve.
  - **Ground-Truth Solution**: If available, the correct solution to the problem, which can be used as a reference. Note that ground-truth solutions may not always be provided, can also contain mistakes, and are often overly succinct. The ground-truth proof is mainly provided to help you understand the problem better.
  - **Proof Solution**: The proof that you need to evaluate. This proof may contain errors, omissions, or unclear steps. The proof was generated by another language model, which was given the following instructions:
  <model_prompt>
    - You are creating a proof, not a proof outline. Each step should be carefully explained and documented. If not properly explained, the judge will assume that you cannot explain it, and therefore decrease your grade.
    - You can use general theorems and lemmas, but only if they are well-known. As a rule of thumb: if the result has a name and is famous enough to have a Wikipedia page or something similar to describe it, it is allowed. Any result from papers that would not be taught in high-school or low-level bachelor courses in mathematics should not be used. Any use of such results will immediately give you a zero grade.
    - Do not skip computation steps in your proof. Clearly explain what transformations were done and why they are allowed in each step of a calculation.
    - You should use correct LaTeX notation to write equations and mathematical symbols. You should encompass these equations in appropriate symbols ("\\(" and "\\)" for inline math, "\\[" and "\\]" for block math) to enhance the clarity of your proof. Do not use any unicode characters.
    - Your proof should be self-contained.
    - If you are not sure about a specific step, or do not know how to prove an intermediate result, clearly state this. It is much preferable to indicate your uncertainty rather than making incorrect statements or claims.
  </model_prompt>

  ### Summary Guidelines:

  First, you should write a concise summary of the proof solution. The summary should capture the main ideas and steps of the proof, but it does not need to be exhaustive. The goal is to provide a clear overview of what the proof is attempting to accomplish.
  A summary should consist of only a few sentences, and it should not contain any judgment or evaluation of the proof. It should be purely descriptive.

  ### Potential Issues to Highlight:

  Your main task is to identify potential issues in the proof solution. You should include any and all issues that you can find, no matter how small. Here are some common types of issues to look for:
  - **Overgeneralization**: The generated proof proceeds by proving the problem in one or more specific cases, and then concludes that the result holds in general. However, it does not provide a proof for the general case.
  - **Oversimplification**: The proof marks steps as trivial or obvious without proper justification. Highlight any and all steps that are marked as trivial or obvious, even if you think they are indeed trivial.
  - **Skipping Computation Steps**: Proofs that skip computation steps or do not explain transformations clearly can lead to misunderstandings. Highlight any steps where the proof skips necessary calculations or explanations.
  - **Citing Non-Standard Works or Theorems**: Some models may cite theorems or results that are not well-known or are not typically taught in high-school or low-level bachelor courses. Such theorems are only allowed if they are well known. If the proof cites such results, highlight this as a potential issue, even if you think it is justified.
  - **Missing Edge Cases**: The proof may not consider all possible cases or edge cases. If you notice that the proof does not address certain scenarios, highlight this as a potential issue.
  - **Wrong Final Answer**: If the proof arrives at a final answer that is incorrect, highlight this as a potential issue.
  - **Other**: Any other issues that do not fit into the above categories but you believe are significant enough to be highlighted.

  For each of these issues, you should identify where in the proof they occur, provide a brief explanation of the issue, and indicate the category of the issue.

  If there are more than four issues, you should only highlight the four most significant ones. Sort the issues by their significance, with the most significant issue first.

  ### Additional Instructions:

  - Do not provide a final grade or score for the proof. Your task is to summarize and highlight potential issues, not to evaluate the proof as a whole.
  - Be critical and thorough in your analysis. If you find no issues, you probably did not look closely enough.
  - If you are unsure whether something is an issue, it is better to highlight it and let the human grader decide.
  - Use clear and concise language in your summary and issue descriptions. The goal of your response is to help and speed up the human grader's work, not to add extra work for them. The more clear and concise your response is, the better it will be for the human grader.
  - You should use correct LaTeX notation to write equations and mathematical symbols in your output JSON. You should encompass these equations in appropriate symbols ("\\(" and "\\)" for inline math, "\\[" and "\\]" for block math) to enhance the clarity of your proof. Do not use any unicode characters.
  - Properly escape all symbols in your output JSON. For example, use `\\` for a single backslash.
  - Spend special attention to producing valid JSON. It needs to be parsable by a standard JSON parser.

  ### Output Format:

  Format your reply using a JSON object as follows:

  ```json
  {{
    "summary": "A concise summary of the proof solution.",
    "issues": [
      {{
        "location": "A description of where the issue occurs in the proof",
        "text": "A citation or excerpt from the proof that contains the issue. If the issue is not contained to a very small part of the proof (e.g., a single sentence), you can leave this field empty.",
        "description": "A brief explanation of the issue.",
        "category": "The category of the issue (Overgeneralization, Oversimplification, Skipping Computation Steps, Citing Non-Standard Works or Theorems, Missing Edge Cases, Wrong Final Answer, Other)."
      }},
      ...
    ]
  }}
  ```
  If you truly cannot find any issues, you can return an empty issues array (either null or an empty list).
